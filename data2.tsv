1	The Forgotten War No Longer Forgotten: Mike Slater has absolutely brought alive the anguish and triumph of those men of the 5th Regimental Combat Team who held the hills of sacrifice in the earliest days of the Korean War and eventually finished their sacrifice along the Armistice line three years later. The depth of research is stunning, not in its presentation of cold facts, but in its blended and balanced perspective from the human and emotional side of the soldiers who fought in Korea. A rich collection of archived military photos as well as personnel photos from those who fought there will not disappoint those who enjoy a more visual depiction of the history they're reading about. An outstanding history that is captivating and remarkable. A must read!!!
0	out of the frying pan, into the fire: This book is the story of a Roman Catholic priest who left his "church". Before becoming a Christian, I was in the "Church" of Rome too, for over twenty years, so I was very excited to read the author's motives.Unfortunately, the author left one cult to enter another. Instead of challenging the Catholic "church" for its many heresies and blatant idolatry, Davis criticizes the church's "outdated views" and unwillingness to accept destructive higher criticism, which is a heresy every bit as bad as Catholic doctrine.
0	Not truly TEA glasses: I received these as a gift. In America a TEA glass is usually12-16 oz glass, as I see now the product description does not say what size they are. so I was surprised to get a small 4 oz glass. They are pretty just not the size I was expecting.

1	Cruising in the convertible, I heard....: I heard the most awesome Hawaiian, yet funky music that was great background music for where I was... in Maui! Those girls have great voices, and I have to say I actually heard this song "Promised love" about 4 times in one day, so I finally asked a man at a local market who was singing this song! I found out, and now have the cd! Maui NO KA OI!
1	Robson Arms: With the Discovery of Corner Gas I was looking for something else new to try. This shows subject matter was a little harsh at first but I stuck with it and still interesting to watch. Not for kids at all though. The stories are very good and seem real. I have plans on buying Season Two.
1	Good workout music: This CD is good for working out. I like all the songs and it is very easy to get into it. Some of the songs are unfamiliar, but with the upbeat music it doesn't matter.
0	Great material; terrible binding: I am using this a text for an International Security class. It is a well constructed summary of the history of thought in this area. However, as I am reading, gently opening the book causes pages to just fall out without any sort of tension. They have clearly never been glued in in the first place.It's just a really disappointing purchase. If I could take time out of reading to return it I would.
1	Great To Have: The solutions/study guide was a great help. I would definitely recommend picking up this supplement if you need to buy the accompanying text.
1	Wonderful: McLeod's Daughters- truly Australia's most beloved drama- is a wonderful TV show, and it features heaps of wonderful, outback-styled music-- kind of like improved country-- capturing the true spirit of the show. Like the drama, its OST sings an anthem of love to nature and to the people who love it. Rebecca LaVelle, who does most of the music for the show and this OST, is a wonderful singer with a lot of soul, and this soundtrack features a variety of songs in different styles that are always fun to listen to. The theme will leave you skipping and smiling; Take The Rain Away, the background vocal for the show's greatest tragedy, will leave you sobbing; and Gentle Gentle, along with the DVD set you know you're just dying to get a hold of, will leave you dreaming of a life as a Jillaroo in some of the world's most beautiful wide open spaces. Buy it! You know you want to. You'll get hooked straight away.
1	Love the music from this series: After finding and watching this series, I fell in love with the music. It is exactly from the series. The songs flow with the ups and downs of life. Love, heartache, loss, hardship and survival. I enjoyed it and I am definitely happy with the purchase. I might even look into purchasing some of the other music.
1	gainsbourg: it's about a young boy who became infamous singer-songwriter Serge Gainsbourg. when he was in his childhood in Nazi-occupied Paris,as he romances many of the era's beautiful women.
1	Classroom Connections: Bernie is going to appear for a second time on my show Classroom Connections to discuss his wonderful book Love, Magic and Mudpies. This book is a must read for all parents, grandparents, caregivers, and teachers.With all the attention given to test scores, parents and teachers need to pause and remember that raising a loving and happy child to be a person of strong moral fiber, is a priority for parents and teachers.Watch Bernie's first appearance on Classroom Connections by going to YouTube and do a search for Classroom Connection or me, Jan Doyle.
1	Perfect tool for home Bodyweight workouts: This item is worth its price and is a great home tool to do bodyweight workouts,great for dips,pull ups and atlas push ups also for leg raises.Easy to store and handy for people living in dorms or appartement!JDC
0	Janky: I purchased this item direct from the Ultimate Body Press web site, and will be returning it. I was very disappointed with the janky quality...it should have been more like $50! The entire unit wiggles and seems of very poor design for the money it cost. There is about an inch of wiggle room when just applying pressure to one side with my finger....the whole thing just slants over. It is a simple design and I'm sure it could have been made a little more sturdy....it's just very cheap looking/feeling. I could build a stronger unit myself for1/10 of the cost........and since this thing doesn't have any real advantages; like folding for storage, you might as well just construct your own unit and save a lot of money AND about 4 weeks of time (the time it took for me to receive mine after ordering it).
0	Very close to buying one, but found much cheaper substitute: I was just about to purchase this, but I read a review that changed my mind.I got a walker instead. I am 6ft165 and able to do at most 45 dips for a set(so far). This walker I recently got is perfect. They are built to support your weight. There was no assembly, and folds up better than this product.I was able to get mine for free as well through a local community center. Even Salvation Army has them for cheap. Amazon and eBay have them for less than half of this product's price.It is only for dips though, and not for any of the back exercises the video shows. Which is why I just bought a pull up bar from Wal-Mart for $19, so I can get some back exercises done at home now. I doubt that most of the people buying this product are doing so for the back exercises portion.Excellent for dips only.Recommend a walker without wheels.Here's a youtube video of a guy using one.
1	Nice dip stand: This stand is just like what you see in the photos and video. I am very impressed with the quality. The tubing is thick enough that even if the padding on the handle sections were to wear out, the handles would still be comfortable. Assembling it was a piece of cake. The item was securely packed so that it survived the shipping process in perfect shape. When I perform dips with it, it is completely stable on my carpeted floor.Before acquiring this stand I was doing dips between two tables. This stand is a100% improvement and much more comfortable on my wrists. I'm sure within a few months of regular use I will have a torso just like the model in the video ;)I'm very happy with this purchase.
1	Three Mo' Tenors: Excellent . beautiful job - recording encompasses several different music styles and they're all done with quality. Have recommended this one to several friends.
0	stinks, don't waste your money or your time if its free: I thought this book sounded like a good mystery type story with some added romance. Well, the mystery part wasn't bad based on where this man came from since he lost his memory and what happened to him. But, if you were hoping for some romance, forget it. This was the most disgusting book I've read. The author was so descriptive and coarse that she described the "enormous cock" right down to the shape and veins. There was constant crude language regarding the woman's "pussy" and more. I skipped over pages of crude, vulgar, and nothing more than porn in a book trying to just find out how the mystery played out. I'm glad I didn't pay1 cent for this and am disgusted that I put any time into it. So, I rarely write reviews on books, but this one I felt was my duty to give a fair warning to those of you who like a little romance that this isn't it! The title makes it sound kind of innocent - lol!
0	Lighthouse book: A lot of the information is outdated or just plain incorrect. There were lighthouses that were in the area that weren't in the book. Because it was outdated, some of the lights that were listed weren't visible due to tree coverage, etc. We did like having GPS coordinates, but sometimes they sent us further away from the light than what we could find on our own. It's a somewhat helpful guide, but use it cautiously and do your own research also.
1	Excellent book: If you are an animal lover and/or have an interest in the struggles of vet school buy this book. It's a good read, lots of details, and has some good stories.
0	It Was an R.L. Stine Flop: The Dare is a regular Fear Street horror book. Nothing different than any other. Nothing was unusual, weird, creepy, scarier than any other. It was boring and I wouldn't recommend to anyone. It was surprising.
0	Did RL stine write this?: Normally, I love fear street books, but this one was terrible! It was pointless, you couldn't relate to the character, it didn't make sense, and it was boring. There is no suspense in this book, and the main character is really weird. My advice: Don't buy it.
1	Raw Revolution Hazelnut Cashew: Fabulous! I take one to work with me every day. I feel deprived without my daily bar!
1	DELICIOUS!!!!!: I was more than surprised when I started to eat this meal bar. It is absolutely delicious! It is 280 calories, which I think is high, but it is worth it. Have this coconut and chocolate bar as a dessert you won't feel guilty eating.
0	Another organic bar, but its HALF fat.: This bar has 265 calories and135 from fat. I know, I know, its organic!! Sorry just because its organic and natural doesn't mean that it can be 50% fat and be good for you. If you like the taste fine, but be honest you're eating it for the taste, about the same calories and fat content as a Dove candy bar.
1	Unknown piano treasures by Adolf von Henselt: If he is known at all these days, Henselt is remembered for an Etude (0pus 2, No. 6 "Si oiseau j'etais") beloved of many great pianists in the earlier years of the 20th century and recorded by quite a few of them. Pianophiles will be familiar with his F Minor Piano Concerto, which has received several recordings, by pianists such as Raymond Lewenthal, Michael Ponti and Marc-André Hamelin.Now Hyperion has once again done us a great service by offering up this recording of two sets of Henselt Etudes, Opus 2 and Opus 5. Piers Lane gives extraordinarily beautiful performances of these difficult works. Henselt's piano writing could sound merely notey in less poetic hands, but Piers Lane brings out its dramatic beauties at every turn. The piano sound is, as usual with Hyperion, splendid.Altogether recommended!
1	Perfect for Removing rust.: This product is perfect for removing rust off of any metal surface that might rust over. I would probably hold of on using this on something that you do not want to get dirty (perfectly polished pipes?). Although it removed rust, there are also tiny micro-particles in the fabric that causes micro scratches, but if removing rust is what you need, this is the product you need to have. I used this on an old motorcycle that was left outside for a few seasons and it cleaned all spots up nicely. NOTE: You do need to use some elbow grease if you want to remove some stubborn rust spots.
1	Beautiful Ring!: I purchased this as a follow up to my engagement ring and it was a perfect match! The ring is gorgeous and made me very happy with my purchase.
1	Meeting Mr. Right or Thanks, Mom: ROMANCE AROUND THE CORNER is a clever little book that was given to me as a Christmas gift--by my mother! She read it, enjoyed it, and recommended it so highly that I just had to read it also. WOW!!! The author, Valerie Beck, practically takes your hand and walks you through the steps toward meeting Mr. Right. Anyone can follow this creative plan, including me--an overworked, single physician.Simply by improving my wardrobe and smiling more, I have improved my outlook on life, thanks to Ms Beck. Plus, by following her plan, I am actually dating again! (Perhaps the reviewer "Sally" should do more than read the Table of Contents and eat fewer sour grapes to improve HER outlook.)In conclusion, I give "2 thumbs up" to this cute, pink book and have purchased several for my single girlfriends-just $12.95 for the paperback!
0	Basically a rehash: I found very little new here that has not been written a dozen times beforehand. Although the title could lead a person to believe that this book is about the British and their strategy in the Revolutionary War down South, this is a bunch of battle histories strung together without a lot of analysis of strategy. John Buchanan's THE ROAD TO GUILFORD COURTHOUSE is a bit better than this one, and mcuh cheaper!
0	crappy poster wanna-be: this in not an original poster, it is a copy of one. you can see the fold marks in the picture.
0	Cheaper Toshiba replacement: I bought this product several years ago to replace my wife's original cord for her laptop. The original AC adapter went bad after 3 years considering the abuse it went through in her last year of college. The original equipment from Toshiba cost over $80 at the time and this replacement seemed a viable option at the time of purchase. Sadly, this product did not last for more than 3 months. The outer insulation covering came separated from the housing and both sides and also at the outlet prong. I never returned the product because I needed this as a short-term fix at the time and have bought another laptop since then. The product served its purpose, but my recommendation is if you are planning to use this product do not use it where there is any stress put on the adapter. It will serve its purpose if you are the type of person who leaves your laptop set on you desk. Simply put, I got what I paid for at the time.
1	Who ever said the media got things right?: Someone mentioned that the factbook lists a country as "Serbia and Montenegro" instead of as "Yugoslavia" as a big complaint about possible factual errors. Serbia existed long before the name "Yugoslavia" ever existed to be put on a map; and with the dissolution of Yugoslavia (for whatever reason one chooses to explain it), it has become Serbia once again, irregardless of what CNN uses on their news reports.If we substitute "Wales and Scotland" and "Great Britian" for "Serbia and Montenegro" and "Yugoslavia", those complaints sound rather silly.
1	Quick Action on Missing Items: In the orginal Shipment, the Box arrived but had no silverware. As this was a gift for a wedding (2,000 miles away)which was set in the next few days. Your very fine phone help person was wonderful in getting the replacement silver to the wedding on time.As this was my first experance with your sight, I was at first conserned about getting it corrected. However she made it right and the gift got there in time for the wedding!Great Work!Bob FluckeySan Francisco
1	Finally available: Nightmare Alley: Ideal film noir. Different and fascinating a trip through the midway of pyschic scams, sideshow geeks and a descent to hell due to ambition. Beautiful cinematography, extraordinary performances especially by Tyrone Power and Joan Blondell. Highly recommend to all film goers. It belows on the100 great films.
1	Shakespeare 4008 8' marine11/2 Dia. Extension: Antenna arrived as promised and in great condition. Very happy with product and it's vendor. I have done business with them in the past and would reccommend them to anybody.
1	Love or Loath Her you always find yourself listening: one thing about Madonna then as now She has never been lost with words on People,Places,&things.She has always had something to say on everything&everyone.I applaud Her for being Herself no matter what.interesting quotes through the years from her.
0	Ho Hum: This is one of the few books that I have read that I can honestly say I did not like at all. The characters were uninteresting, and the story was slow and senseless. The plodding pace had me stopping frequently to try and remember what I had just read. Since I read this book in1990, I have made a concerted effort to avoid Lewitt's books.
1	Great book, very useful for teachers!: This is a very practical book full of history and information that is very helpful for classroom teaching. I teach 6th grade and found the diagrams and projects interesting and helpful in building an understanding of the sky.
1	A lovely gardening read...: This book is so beautiful. After I received it I bought a copy for my best gardening buddy. I need to get one more for a couple who are apartment dwellers, but I found it very inspiring and useful and I garden on 3/4 of an acre. It's the best thing visually since "The Art of French Gardening". Thank you Rebecca Cole!
0	bla: This product is suposed to be a very good tool , in theory but unfortunately in rel life is not , the tool will thread fine up to1' but as soon as you go higher than that the bracket that holds the entire machine will break like a toothpick , and the reason is ,the bracket is made of cast iron and cannot hold the stress created by the machine , bottom line CHEAP, CHEAP. I did not know that and i got a second one and payed 200 more , and and up the same way , now i've got two machines witch are useless ( cant be used without the bracket ), and had to buy the rigid one ( another 600$). Now you do the math.
0	sound quality very poor: there are some great songs here - "maintaining my cool" may be my favorite Sonics number, but the sound quality of this dvd is inferior to my old record with the same content. A real disappointment.
1	Fantastic: I really enjoyed this book. I needed a little more closure, but it still gets 5 stars from me.
1	another great: another awesome nickelodeon show. i love the adventures and all the animals that they encounter. such a fun show to watch.
1	Jumanji - Hitting it!: Following Mateo is definitely a down to earth book. My friend Tom definitely put it right about life in the southern villages of Toledo and also as a missionary. I've known Tom for the two years that he spent here in Belize. I loved the book and will definitely read it again.
1	Catch Up: Somehow I missed the Pixies. Maybe it was growing up in the Midwest in the 80s and being subject to classic rock stations galore. In any case, wondering who the band was that influenced so many 90s artists, I had to check them out. For my primer, I bought this greatest hits collection. Usually, it takes a few listens to find my favs in the album. Coming from the place of not knowing which songs were the "popular ones" is always a fun experience. However, I did begin to recognize songs I had heard over the years, either placed in movies/tv or casually on the radio - more so than I expected. Ones that stuck out for me were: Hey!, Gigantic, Gouge Away, Where Is My Mind. Love how this collection starts off with the total Garage Band sound and develops into the more polished (but not over-polished) production sound.
1	And God looked down on the Pixies....: There has been a lot of excitement surrounding The Pixies. They are the most influential band of the1980s. Black Francis invented the slow verse and fast chorus that paved the way for Kurt Cobain and PJ Harvey. Radiohead owe everything to them. They just finished playing Coachella to a packed house. I am glad that I wasn't there because it was mayhem. This is the first great collection of the best of four perfect albums. The Pixies (1987-1992) was this generation's Ulysses. All the hits are here. Hopefully this leads back to the albums. The Pixies deserve to be heard in their entirety. They created album rock and never had a dull moment. Even some of their later projects were great. Kim Deal's voice is great. Black Francis is a great songwriter. The guitar parts are so original. This is a great band. Hopefully more albums are released in the future. There are a lot of live shows out there.
1	Bark Magazine: I absolutely love Bark Magazine! I love the "smiling" pages and the tips every issue. I am a dog lover and have rescued all of my dogs from either death row or from people who were going to put them down. Everyone deserves a chance at living and Bark reinforces that with their articles. This magazine is a MUST HAVE for any dog lover!!
1	great listener!: This item can record as if it was right by the speaker, even though they'll be15 feet away at least. It picks up everything that's around. I'm going back to collage. I don't think it'll miss any part of the lecture.
0	Does not extent to18': There is an error in description. Only extends to 6.5' . Good buy if that's okay.
1	Good Flying Video: I am not one to listen to a guy stand on camera and talk about how great a place is. This video starts a little slow but gets going right away. They have a great deal of flying. Almost all the video is shot from the cockpit. Good thing in my view. The little talking they do is just to show what each spot has to offer and then back to the flying. I really enjoyed this video and it is good to see these places before you go into them. I understand it is not intended to be an instructional video but the quality and quantity of the content is very good.
0	STEAMER: IT MIGHT BE A GOOD PRODUCT BUT I PURCHASED IT TO CLEAN MY GROUT,IT DOES BUT VERY SLOWLY AND WITH THE WATER NEEDED A SHORT WORKING TIME.A TOOTHBRUSH AND SOME HYDROGEN PEROXIDE WILL CLEAN BETTER FOR GROUT.
0	Meh: Flaws:The little attachments are tiny scrub brushes. I tried to use them on grout. The grout shredded them.The "wait" light goes on every 60-90 seconds and you have to sit there and wait. This wouldn't be such a problem if I didn't have a 2 year old, but my time is in short supply.You have to wait for it to heat up before you use and and in between fill ups, you have to wait for it to cool down before you refill and wait for it to heat up again. This means about 30-40 minutes in between fill ups.So loud you need to use ear protection
1	Wagner Steam Cleaner: Great buy. I have steam clean a TON of stuff since I got this. Works really great on the kitchen stove. Used it to clean a greasy, grimey landing that had dirt built up for 20 years. It's pretty amazing. Wish it had a few more attachments, but otherwise, very pleased
1	GREAT STEAMER, Great price: I bought this steamer to clean our new NY apartment. So far I have cleaned all the grout and tiles in the bathroom, and it reaches that awful place behind the toilet :-) We also steam cleaned all the walls in preparation for a new paint job. This is a great steamer with good attachments! You can only steam for an hour at a time but in all honesty, your arms get tired after an hour anyway. I would highly recommend this product to all mom's who are looking for a safer way to clean without harsh chemicals.
1	Cleaning with Steam: I recently purchased the Wagner 9051,500 Watt Steam Cleaner. I could not be happier. Although I have owned a steam cleaner before -- a competitor's product and was fairly satisfied with its performance, there is no comparison between the Wagner and other products. I did a side-by-side comparison of several models that were similar to the Wagner and the Wagner came up higher in almost every category. The Wagner gets extremely hot very quickly, puts out a lot of steam so cleaning does not take as long, and cleans everything from crown molding to floors. I even used the corner brush to steam clean my furniture! Unbelievable how much difference this made to the appearance of the furniture. The Wagner is well priced and is a step above its competitors.Wagner 9051,500-Watt On-Demand Power Steamer and Cleaner
0	Did not perform well: I bought this product to primarily clean the grout in the bathroom. I was also hoping that it would work well for the kitchen floor. I was so disappointed. I had read the previous reviews and thought this sounded like it performed fairly well. Well it didn't. I sent it back. Not only was it loud - I was almost deaf after using it in the bathroom with the noise echoing off of all that tile - but it just didn't do much at all. Maybe it works good for other things?
1	Superclean: I am in love with my new steamer!! The grout in my 50 year old bathroom looks brand new. Can highly recommend. FOr floor cleaning the attachments could be more sturdy but there is no arguing with the results.
0	Not useful for older wallpaper: This product is not useful for removing older wallpaper. Can damage wall board underneath and is less effective than liquid wallpaper remover. Perhaps it would work well for the removal of more modern wallpapers, but if you have multiple layers of wallpaper in an older house I would recommend the liquid wallpaper remover instead.
0	Power Steamer: In reviewing the comments on how much you can do with this product I must say I am a little disappointed. I thought I could use it to steam clean my outdoor BBQ grill. It did not do anything to the outside. I even sprayed it first with a cleaner. I also tried to clean the grills. I had to spray Oven Cleaner on the grill first & had to use one of the brushes to get it somewhat clean. I have no intention to remove wallpaper but did use it to clean the ceramic tile flooring in the kitchen. Decent job.Too much money for the job it did.
1	Good Steam Cleaner: Purchased this product to clean original cermanic tile in my 55 year old home. I used it on the kitchen counter, floor and bathroom tile on the wall and counter. I am pleased with the performance of the machine. The little brushes included with the package work well on the grout. This machine gets surfaces clean and does not require chemicals to do it.
1	An effective wet steamer: I bought this steamer on the recommendation of my pest control officer as we are currently dealing with bedbugs. I have used it to steam my furniture and carpet to kill the bugs and as far as I can tell it's been very effective. I can't comment, therefore, on the uses it's intended for, like wall paper stripping. It's very easy to use and has lots of useful attachments. My only gripe would be that it does spit water, but under most circumstances I'm sure that wouldn't affect what you're doing. All in all very pleased.
0	not worth buying: I can make this very short the power steamer worked great untill all the plastic parts broke. When the handle broke it was the end of the line the unit was set out for the garbage.
0	Not very impressed: There was nothing special about this machine. I can do the same amount of work as this machine does with a rag and soapy water. It isn't totally useless I suppose...but not worth spending the money. I was expecting something great.
1	Cyberchase shows: In the past I have not missed a single Cyberchase show, now it's going to be a book!!! I'm really excited.
0	integrity, honesty: I received the game in a short amount of time, the game does not work in my new console..I wrote the company I purchased it from, they were very understanding, returned my payment and told me to keep the game and try in someone else's console..I will purchase from them again, as they did not even question my integrity, nor my honesty which makes them top in my world.
0	Legal Action for a defective product?: Hello, I've had the same problem with this tv. The blue blotches and the yellow discoloration. My warranty did expire though Zenith did say they would cover the 2500 dollar part. That's nice and all, but I assume they are using the same parts that these tvs were initially built with. I expect it will work for about another year or so until I'm faced with having to shell out all that money to have it fixed again. I'm wondering if any legal action can be taken against Zenith/LG for manufacturing and selling a defective product? Perhaps it falls under some kind of product liability law? I Just want my money back and I'll be satisfied!!!
0	Very Interesting Person/Very Amateur Documentary: This doc only whetted my appetite to learn more about the life of Chrysis. It teased me and then did not get the job done! What a loss. Maybe someone else will make a decent documentary about Chrysis.
0	A BIG MISTAKE: WHAT A MISTAKE BUYING THIS SAW I DID NOT BUY IT FOR EVERYDAY USE ONLY CAUSUAL VERY VERY HARD TO START EVEN AFTER RETURNING IT FOR REPAIR THE FRAME BROKE ON THE BOTTOM ALSO LEAKS OIL A REAL JUNKER ***** DO NOT BUY THIS SAW
0	MBT: My first B9180 lasted about two weeks before sending a message saying "Service Stall". It never recovered and was replaced under warranty. My second B9180 lasted almost a month before sending the same message. It too was replaced under warranty. My 3rd B9180 lasted one year and 5 days. It then began spitting yellow ink all over photos and the inside of the printer. It was out of warranty and will cost me about $300 for an exchange through HP.When the printer actually works, it does a great job on prints ranging in size from 4 x 6 to13 x19. But I've got to think that my run of bad luck with these printers is more than just coincidence. I'd look elsewhere for a photo printer.
0	Just Stopped Working after One Month of Light Use: I've owned this printer for less than two months. Just last week, it stopped working. After a few minutes with tech support, I was told I have "defective firmware" and that I can exchange it for a new one. Here's what it does: When I print something, it stops in the middle of the first piece of paper, and tells me I'm out of paper. Nothing prints, I'm actually not out of paper, the thing is just totally screwed up. Another thing, when I first bought it and set it up, before I had a chance to print one thing on it, it ran out of black matte ink. It wouldn't let me set it up on the network cause it wouldn't let me past the "out of black matte ink" message on the screen. My local stores do not carry this kind of speciality ink, so I had to wait until my ink arrived in the mail and the network person had to come back to my house to finish setting up the network.
0	Dissatisfied: Owning and using this printer has been a very frustrating experience. I've been using hp inks and paper, and printing from Adobe photoshop and Lightroom, and no matter what I do the prints look muddy. This printer is an energy hog - you have to leave it on all the time because if you turn it off it demands 3 full size sheets of glossy paper so that it can realign its printheads - wasting ink and paper! Lately I have been using it to print a logo and return address on stacks of postcards from Mircosoft Publisher, and it keeps telling me I have the wrong size paper (even when I *just* set the printing preferences). It also keeps telling me the carriage is jammed but most of the time the carriage will move just fine if I press the OK button - except that it spits out a half-printed card. What a waste!! It was expensive, takes up a lot of space, and not once has it turned out anything I've been really happy with. I would give it zero stars if I could.
0	Don't buy this printer!: My B9180 worked properly for a total of about one month before developing major problems, which frustratingly come and go without reason. These problems have included banding, extreme color errors, paper loading errors, stalling. Even when working this printer is painfully slow as it always seems to hold you up with some kind of 'routine maintenance' like head cleaning that make you wait10 minutes before you can print - making it unsuitable for anybody with deadlines.Bottom line: this printer has good specs and looks great on paper, but doesn't back that up with any acceptable amount of quality or durability.
0	DONT BUY THIS!!!: The worst printer I've every had, by far. Painfully slow. Jams constantly. Very noisy. Every time you bring your PC out of sleep mode, it pops up an annoying Status window indicating the printer is online, also pops this up randomly at times. I will go back to Epson next time.
0	Appalling wheel marks on glossy paper... not a pro machine.: HP must be some very powerful company. I've read lots of positive reviews on this printer, so i went a purchased one.But i quickly found out that it marks lines on glossy paper (both HP and Tetenal)This is unacceptable for a pro range model. IF you don't use the printer daily, the ink cartridges will be emptied via some "servicing", ie., to keep the jets unplugged, the machine keeps gushing the ink out every so often... you return home after a few days to find your cartridges near empty.Then after a year, i keep having to reset, restart, keep finger crossed etc...A nightmare !!I do not recommend HP B9180, and i won't buy HP again, ever again !
1	very well made bag. But it's too big.: I bought this bag for a Gitzo 3541 tripod. Although not the largest of tripods, it is of moderate size. The only thing larger in Gitzo are Series four or five tripods, which have a wider top portion. Even under those circumstances, I find the space a bit too generous. Extra space means extra bulk when carrying and the internal slop negates some of the protection that is afforded by the bag. I'm in the process of ordering something that fits my tripod better. I'm going to use this case for compact light-stands, which it seems well suited for. I can fit three Cowboy studio light-stands that fold up on themselves, quite easily. Like I said, it's a well-made case, just not for most tripods. And for the minority of people out there that carry series four or five tripods (or equivalent), I would assume, they have the budget to spend on something more tailor made.
0	Problems: I agree with Peter Williams. It was great to finally see some episodes of this long-forgotten series come out on DVD. BUT...the quality is apalling!! Discs 2 and 3 are full of pixelation problems...and the episode THE BLOWUP (on disc 2) jams...then jumps 6 minutes ahead. The result...a 48 minute episode plays for about 42 minutes...missing a few vital scenes in the middle of the episode. More care in mastering (or manufacturing) is required from Timeless Media before I'll be buying any more of their DVDs.
1	Love it!: Clear, crisp images, used in bright sunlight it makes the color saturation and contrast so much more visible. Can't live without this one in sunny Florida, especially when waterside compositions are being photographed. Reduces glare, restores back lighting to a natural color.
0	rather poor quality: It worked well for about 6 months until the top element died. Light use-a slice of toast maybe twice a day, and an occasional melted sandwich.definitely not worth the price.
0	Disappointed: The Rotisserie was nice, made some nice juicy chicken.I enjoyed this product for the few months it actually worked.Their customer service department is simply a JOKE. Rude and helpless a total waste of my and their time...would NOT buy this brand again.
0	finally trashed: this dvd player is the worst. I bought it at a bargain price, but what a mistake!the dvd drawer opens REALLY slow!some DVD's don't work, althought hey work just fine with my other DVD player.it takes a long time for the dvd player to actually start playing the disc.I'll give it 2 stars because it was cheap and it's nice to look at. I gave it to my friend and he already gave it to charity.a real P.O.S.I'm happy with my new Sony1 disc player. it's fast and plays all of my dvd's.
0	The toy broke within a few weeks: The toy did seem pretty neat - until it broke a couple of weeks later :-(..No sounds anymore..Also the on/off switch was impossible for my1 year old to find (frankly it was hard for me too - it's very hidden)/.
0	Obvious Bias, Lack of Qualification: There are numerous reports that can debunk most, if not all, of the ideas presented in this book. A far better (free) report on this type of thing is "The Lanning Report", by Kenneth Lanning, an FBI Agent who used to work specifically with ritual abuse cases. Google for it & check it out; I promise you'll be glad that you didn't waste your money on this piece of junk.
0	author has an agenda: some of the research is credible, but the conclusions in most cases don't follow the research. for example, the state department is consistenly blamed for actions undertaken by the defense department. why? also, many of america's arrangements with other governments are not examined in the context of the cost-benefit analysis as a whole; they are only presented in isolation which would make many arrangements puzzling and suspicious. given that, the question here is why did the author selectively choose which foreign countries to isolate?ultimately, the real question raised by this book is what were the author's motivations in praising the defense department and attacking the state department?if the reader is looking for a more insightful and balanced view of the relationship between the 2 organizations, i would recommend "Kissinger" by walter isaacson.
0	Not really a book, not really about Cap Anson: Cap Anson 2 is actually about another19th century baseball star, Mike "King" Kelly ! It has no narrative flow at all, it's just a massive collection of newspaper snippets about Mike Kelly. For a real book about the great, flamboyant player, I suggest you read the original bio of Kelly, from Scarecrow Press' Sports History series. It's by Marty Appel, a real author.
0	Boo: After a few months of having the TV we noticed dark gray spots when it was a dark part. Luckily it was still under warrenty and Zenith came out and fixed it right away. Then just recently we got a blue spot in the bottom corner that grew across the bottom. We're still able to watch tv (for now) but not for long it sounds like. We got online and looked up the issue only to find out this is almost a guarenteed problem with this model of Zenith and cost more to fix than buying a new TV. We seem to be lucky having it last ALMOST 4 years, some people's didn't even last 2.
0	Repaired Twice!!!!: Mine did the same as all of the others, blue screen the works, less then a year after purchase. Under warranty the entire contents of the light engine have to be replaced. Now a year and a half later the exact same issue. I did purchase extended warranty so I didn't have to pay for the repair. So, here is the deal guys. If you buy this TV which by the way when working properly does have a nice picture better buy it form some place that offers an extended warranty like for 4 yrs and that includes a lemon policy. That way you end up with a new TV after they have fixed it 3 times....BECAUSE they will. I want a different too what a piece of junk. The thing is it was just released before the technology was ready. So lets admit it and make it right!!! I'll at least respect you that way.
0	Class Action Suit?: My boyfriend bought this TV the first year it came out--he paid almost $6,000 for it!!! It's now almost four years old. We've have the same green/yellow tinge with loads of blue throughout. Quoted over $1,000 for the repair. The local repair people didn't even have to come look at it to know what the diagnosis was. This product is a lemon and the manufacturer keeps rolling out the product year after year. The manufacturers are criminals. If I had the money and time, I'd sue them.
1	Worked Great!: Great Product! the quality is great nice Glass construction. Will buy more products from them in the future.
1	Early 70s pop that has aged remarkably well: I recently picked this up on a whim. I'm 49 years old and had never purchased a Carpenters record. I saw it at a used record store and thought, "Isn't it about time?" Now, I've always had mixed feelings about the Carpenters, and I wasn't sure I'd be able to make it all the way through this. Well, not only did I listen to it straight through, I left it in the CD player for several days and several more listens. Yes, the songs tend to be saccharine, and the production is technically flawless to the point of sterility, but it's never corny. It is what it is, and it's totally sincere. The instrumental performances, largely multi-tracked by Karen and Richard, are breathtaking, and Karen was simply one of the greatest singers of all time. Isn't it about time you gave the Carpenters another listen?
1	The Secret Knowledge of Grown-Ups: Do you know why squash is named "squash"? Why you shouldn't jump on the bed? Why you should eat your vegetables? This book offers a humorous look at the answers to these questions.In this nonsensical look at these answers, parents and children alike will laugh and enjoy it over and over again. Illustrations capture attention in a comical manner. The print is large and easy to read. As teachers, we recommend this to all ages--and teachers, too, who could use this as a springboard to creative writing.
1	Creative Writing Exemplified: This is a very funny book. I use it in my classroom of middle schoolers.As an English teacher, I use this book in my classroom to illstrate "creative thinking". We had so much fun writing similar rules.
0	BORING-BORING-BORING: I HAD EXPECTED MORE ABOUT SPIRITUALITIY FROM THIS WORK BUT WAS VERY DISSAPOINTED TO READ MORE FAR OUT VIEWS ON THE AUTHORS OPINIONS OF WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THIS WORLD. I FELT ALOT OF ANGAR EMINATING FROM THIS WORK. COULD SOMEONE WHO SEEMS SO ANGRY REALLY BELIEVE IN THE LAW OF ONE? THIS BOOK CONTAINS MORE FICTION THAN SPIRITUALLITY AND I COULD NOT RECCOMMEND IT TO ANYONE.
0	Awkward fit: This review is for product & seller.I did not like this product. It's bulky & extremely uncomfortable. I'm surprised people can sleep in it. I'm petite so ordered an XS. It was too big. It offered no support to upper back and did not help posture.As for the seller. BUYER BEWARE! I suggest you shop around. I feel ripped off. I never used the product & not only did i have to pay return shipping, buy they charged a 20% restocking fee. I ended up paying $17 out of pocket just for trying the stupid thing on. Not worth it!
0	Same reviews for all sellers: It does not give me confidence buying from Amazon when the same reviews for a product are applied to all the sellers of the product. I cannot get specific information on the sellers' products to see if they are genuine original products, or "equivalent" products, whether of good or poor quality. Because there is no differentiation between the sellers and their products; and I am unable to make a fair comparison from the information provided or other peoples' experiences; I must purchase elsewhere.
0	It's Not Multicoated. Leaves a funny flare when taking pictures of light.: It works as a polarizer no doubt. Fits right on my 50mm lens.But it creates a wierd greenish flare when I am taking pictures of any light source (e.g. lamps, sunlight).But sometimes flares are cool. I would recommend spending more money on a multicoated circular polarizer, or not buying any at all.
0	You get what you pay for: Same experience as Mr. Kupo.It needs to be completely quiet in the room for this thing to work at all. Even then, it often displays the wrong note, and for the E string it displays it for such a short time I can't even tell if it's tuned properly.Overall, I have a tuner app on my iPhone that I went back to using because this thing is so frustrating to use. Either buy something better or save your money for something else-it's not worth having around.
0	Baby I Love You Solution: You can get the unedited "Baby I Love You" at iTunes.Yes, yes, they're the devil, but at least you can get the song the way the Yayhoos performed it, instead of this Wal-Mart version.
1	The Restless Gun: We purchased The Restless Gun on 6/7/12, three DVD set with 24 episodes. We have until now completed the first disc and part way through the second, we have enjoyed each episode so far with very good storyline, acting with John Payne playing his role so well, and no doubt the quality of the picture and sound, no surprise there as this is what we receive each time with Amazon and Timeless Media Group. For those that like Westerns this is a good quality product.
0	Confusing: I cannot understand how anyone could give this book even a 2 star rating let alone a five star rating. Every third word of the text was an acronym and in at least one case an acronym appeard before it was defined. I was thoroughly confused from the git go. Furthermore if you are interested in finding out how HDTV works, you won't find any information on that in this book. I gave up after two chapters and returned it to the library.
1	Psychoanalyzing Your Favorite Producers Through PIctures: I've never spent so much time analyzing a photo book. Each picture occupies me with about five minutes of psychoanalysis, trying to figure out the motives behind each piece of gear or memorabilia in the pictures. Each studio also confirms my hypothesis: the cleaner the home studio environment/setup, the less that actually gets done.
0	Saw Palmetto-miracle cure?: The Vitamin Shoppe got this product to my house quickly, but it did not work. I had studied that saw palmetto was good for hair loss,but all it gave me was a headache. I saw NO improvement in hair growth. I studied that it was good for prostate health and libido. Basically, it just made me have to urinate ALOT and reaked havoc on my kidneys. I will NEVER get this product again.
0	great til it explodes in your hand: I had one of these for about a year and it worked great, then one day I used them on a stubborn caliper. Now look I'm no super human or anything but I went to squezzing this tool and the ratcheting mechanism completely failed in mid squeeze. It made a loud pop and my hand was numb for a week. so I'll say don't attempt to use this on anything that is going to resist your effort, but then if you did that, a pair of channel locks and an old brake pad would work fine. I recommendSir Tools (SIRST9020-KIT) AIR-GUN Pneumatic Brake Caliper Piston Compressor Master Kita pnuematic compressor if you must have one. perhaps,you want this one for actuated calipers anyway. if you don't want to get this extravagant maybe a pair of the scissor style spreaders.
0	A Mindless Boring Button-Mashing Game with Heroes in It: I finished the game and had to write a review on this game because it was so bad. The game is basically a button-mashing game with no excitement. I found myself trudging through the game just so that I could finish it. Otherwise I would have spent a lot of money for nothing. If you are a novice gamer, you will get bored with this game. If you are a veteran gamer, you will stop playing in ten minutes. Don't waste your money on this game. It felt like a game the company rushed to put out in order to cash in on the super hero craze and/or holiday spending. There are many games out there that are super hero games out there that are a whole lot better like X-Men Legends I and II. They even came out way before this dud.
0	Ambitious but dull: Robinson's story is very ambitious and brims with a ton of detail. However, it's incredibly dull. These are a series of linked stories, each involving new characters (despite the thread of reincarnation ostensibly tying each story together). None of the individual stories is compelling--the characters are mostly bland, nothing in their lives is particularly at stake, and the alternative history aspect is an very minor component. I loved Robinson's Mars trilogy, but was incredibly disappointed in this book.
0	Ponderous, dull, self-absorbed, metaphysical BS.: It took months to slog through this yawner because I alternately fell asleep or found somthing far more interesting to read, which wasn't a difficult task.
0	This book defeated me: I threw this book in the trash the other day unfinished. I never do that but this book just defeated me.I loved Kim Stanley Robinson's Mars series and had high expectations for this book, even knowing going in that it was different in many ways.The alternative history and reincarnation aspects were sort of intriguing at first but the many stories contained in the book (due to the periodic "reset" of reincarnation) are boring and hard to follow. There is just too much text dedicated to mundane activities and no real plot to latch on to.The book put me to sleep more times than I can count to the point I just had to give up.
1	Love Letters is simple, yet heartbreaking: Love Letters has a very simple concept: Two people reading letters they wrote to each other on separate parts of the stage. They never look at each other. But within these letters is so much humor, love, and truth that the play will carry you away with delight. I read this play as I was browsing through a bookstore. I just wanted to read the first couple of pages since I'd heard so much about it. After page three, I didn't want to put it down. Now I'm buying it for a friend. Don't think this play is a sappy collection of gushy girl talk or even romance-novel fodder. If you have ever been in love, you WILL recognize parts of yourself in this. It always stays true to its well-drawn characters, which is what makes the end so heartbreakingly wonderful.
1	As an actress in this show...: I am involved in a production of this play right now, and I have to say that when I read it before I auditioned, i cried, and the same was true in both call backs and the read through. This is a moving piece that proves that two people do not have to be married to be truly in love and live for each other. This play helped me inspect my own life and treat those around me with more thought as to the rest of our lives together. An excellent read, for the layman and the professional...
0	Worse than Worthless: Don't bother getting this book. It's a load of junk. Worse than a load of junk. The advice given is bad advice and if you follow it, you will end up at best being laughed at, at worse owing the IRS MORE money in penalties and interest than when you started. You could lose your car, you could lose your house.People have already tried using the ideas in this book and they have lost in court.The statements about who is an employee and who owes taxes are dead wrong and if you follow them, you will end up owing everything you owed before plus more in penalties and interest.DON'T BUY THIS BOOK !If you need a book to help you deal with the IRS. There are far better books put out by Nolo Press including:Stand Up to the IRS,Surviving an IRS Tax AuditFight the IRS in Tax CourtandTax Savvy for Small Businesses (which helps you avoid ever needing the other three).Any of those books would be far more helpful than "Cracking the Code"
1	First book of a promising series: Grace, Hannah, and Amelia are senior citizens who are living in a joyless boarding home, thanks either to their circumstances or to their children.When Amelia inherits a home in the mountains of North Carolina, the ladies decide to investigate the house and see if it has possibilities. They overcome their fears and doubts and even the ramshackle state of the house in order to renovate and renew their lives and create a new home together. They soon fall in love with Covington and become involved with new interests and new friends. Their first year in Covington is an eventful one, as they forge their new lives and gain confidence and independence. Not all of their problems are solved, which leaves plenty for the succeeding books in the series. I look forward to reading more about the Ladies of Covington.
0	Another "waste your money on" toy from Mattel: I recently purchased the Hot Wheels Tech Trax Crash Chamber for my Grandsons birthday. It took hours to put it together, had to be "just so" or it wouldn't carry the car. NONE of the other Hot Wheels cars my Grandson has (about 50) would work on the track. The car that was sent fell apart and you have to order MORE to use the track at all. My Grandson got no use out of this set and was very frustrated. It was very disappointing. It's no wonder the price was so reduced. I won't be buying any more Hot Wheels cars or accessories from Mattel. Too bad, you used to be a good company.
1	A simple, well thought-out, introduction to lace knitting.: Before getting this book, my knitting had been limited to Arans and Guernseys.This book is a great introduction to designing and creating your own lace creations. Starting with triangles, the author step-by-step explains the different shapes in which shawls traditionally are knit. While there are 8 patterns for shawls in the back of the book, I think the author's point in writing this is to get your own creative juices flowing. She shows you that it is possible to be a designer.For me, the charts of different lace stitch patterns are more of help than hindrance, as the review below suggests. By using the charts and some graph paper, the designer can "see" what the design is going to look like before it is even knitted.Overall this is a great book!
1	a very good book for sql7 beginner: I've used Access 97 for 2 years now and I want to upsize to SQL7. This book offers me the basic overview nearly all aspects of the product.
0	Bad Exerience: The TV which was received was not the one pictured in the Amazon ad nordescribed in the description. The TV received had speakers underneath and not on the sides. The ad noted that the TV had frame by frame capability which the one received did not. Discount Jungle offered a $20 refund or to take it back at my expense (over $50) I seem to be stuck with it.
1	The best guide for single women everywhere: As a single, black female in my late 20s, I have continually focused on finding someone to have as my own. This book made me realize that person is me. I am SO incredibly happy being single the book made me realize I can have a fulfilling life into my 30s, 40s, 50s and beyond without being tied down to someone. The alternative to being single is not bliss (I've seen way to many messed up relationships to believe that's true). Being single is a blesing and not a curse.I've read a lot of "you go girl" & "loving the solo life" kind of books, but this one offers practical advice and really struck a cord like others haven't.
0	Quality control issue: It ran too fast, it gained 7-8 minutes per hour! Unacceptable. I had a Tissot Seastar Automatic and it only gained a minute in 5 days. Was not expecting this from Seiko. I really liked the simple construction and design, I could have it's time adjusted in a jewelry store but wouldn't want to pay more when it should be working properly in first place. Not worth the time. I have to return in.
0	WRONG Keyboard:1) The "64350" keyboard is for MAC computers only, not PC's!2) The product photo (white keyboard) that you see here on Amazon is NOT the keyboard that you will receive. The white keyboard photo is for the 64330 keyboard, not the 64350 keyboard. For a detailed description of the "64350" keyboard that you will receive, go [online.]P>3) After promising a full refund (including shipping), and after returning the keyboard, Office Depot did not even refund the full amount of the keyboard plus taxes! After calling up and complaining, they again said they would offer a full refund.4) Over a week has gone by and Office Depot has not corrected the incorrect keyboard image on this web page.
1	Blue Murder1: I first watch Caroline Quentin in Jonathan Creek. Blue Murder is compelling, sometimes intense, but has a mixture of humor, family life. A great series. C.W.
0	Horrible Instructions - Didn't Work After Many Attempts: I bought this so I could enjoy my new Sony 36" HDTV at night without waking the baby. First, the instructions simply say "make necessary connections" and nothing more! My TV was set up by the delivery technicians, but I still am pretty knowledgeable about such things. There was no available "Audio Out" on my set, so I tried everything that was open on the back of my receiver. Nothing worked. Never did get sound. I am returning this product ASAP! Who needs the aggravation!??!? Maybe I'll try a Sony model.
0	I hate to tell you but these [###].: Finding the exact right frequency for the headphones is a never ending task. I bought the cheapest and upgraded until I got to the most expensive wireless headphones from Sennheiser. The bass doesn't come through and they just aren't acceptable. I returned them all one by one and got the Sony ones. Great bass and good reception. Sony only has 2 chanels though so if a lot of people have them, it becomes tougher not to interfere.
1	Gorgeous: Although the islands are ignored, the crisp photography, narrator with a pleasant burr and fine music make this an exceptional entry in the "Visions of" collection. Almost equal to "Over Ireland," still the best of the fly-by films.
0	Not As Good As I Had Hoped: Although stunningly beautiful in a number of places, the videographer spent an odd extra amount of time filming bizarre things like a ship passing under a bridge, the same ship passing under other bridges, and the same ship passing under by under the helicopter. Was the "The Ship" video? In other areas, the videographer seems to delight in filming their landing and airport flyovers. Not exactly what I wanted to see in a video about Scotland. Numerous clips were used repeatedly (yeah, saw that, yep saw that already... etc) and instead of filming the countryside or town, the videographer focuses on one specific spot in a town (a tall castle, or one hill peak) so you don't get the see the rest of the town or hillside. Narration, when it exists at all, seems to be a complete after thought and is incomplete, boring, and tedious. This is not what I would call a quality product and given the price, it's a definite NOT RECOMMENDED review from me.
1	Visually spectacular, but ....: Although I liked the video there are a few locations that the narration never identifies, and there are many well known islands that we never are shown. I am puzzled why Islay, Skye, Harris, etc. are never shown, especially considering how much time is spent on the major cities. Perhaps the video should have been longer, or multi-episode?
0	J.D. Robb is great--The others aren't worth the time.: If you are a fan of the J. D. Robb "In Death" series with Eve Dallas as the main character, then you will probably want to get this book just to read the short story featuring Eve Dallas by J.D. Robb. The other three stories will probably be an ever-increasing disappointment to you. The final story in this book was about a menage a trois and ended with absolutely no resolution of any of the plot points whatsoever. I rate it a complete waste of time and money. But I love Eve Dallas' character so I would have bought the book if only for her story.
1	So much fun!: I played this recently (with a group of 30 somethings) and it is HYSTERICAL. So much fun, but half the fun is watching people play and their reactions when they get "shocked." A great game to bring out in a crowd - adults or kids. Someone in my group got it as a white elephant gift, and I liked it so much I had to search for it here. A must at a good party.
1	Wonderful Step-by-Step photo directions: Along with the great gardening plans and in depth directory of vegetables giving soil requirements, sowing, harvesting, storage, pests, diseases and varieties best suited for your location, each vegetable has 5 or 6 pictures. The recipes are divided by season and the photos were very easy to follow in order to create very fancy dishes in a very simple manner. The fillets of sea bream in filo pastry really garnered lots of compliments! I used cod instead of sea bream, but the filo was so easy to use and the dish looked so fancy but was easy to prepare. I also used the sabayon for dessert and it was perfection for a heavy meal! I had never mixed potatoes with parsnips, never cooked with parsnips! So many of the recipes broaden the culinary repertoire! I have given this book to several friends and one couple fixed dinner for me as a thank you!
0	Small calf boot: I couldn't even zip up this boot, the material didn't seem to be of high quality either. It felt like thin pleather. I ended up returning this boot as soon as I received it.
1	Theology of Holiness: The word theology kind of intimated me. I assumed the book would be a little over my head but was surprised on how basic the author presented biblical truths. The book gives a solid foundation on the theology of holiness.
0	not worth the cost: Simple enough truisms, just not worth the money. I would return it if the shipping back wasn't going to cost me almost as much as the purchase price. Pretty pictures, but I agree with some of the other reviewers, they should be bigger to be effective. I would want to pay about 2.99 for this book.Doesn't add anything that many other books have already stated more eloquently.
0	ok for beginners: I found this tape to be much too slow, not challenging at all. I did not finish the workout as I felt I was wasting my time. A true beginner could probably benefit.
0	Dissapointing documental: This film, specially the third disc, is dissapointing. I thought it would be something based on true facts, but instead of saying the things as they were, the information is manipulated and combined with opinions of people that are out and against the Catholic Church and there are quite few opinions that come from people that are in favor of the principles and doctrine of the Catholic Church, I really think that this film was made to create confusion within the faithful catholics. Spend your money in something worthy.
0	pictures on web-site: when i ordered this product i was led to believe that it was more to it.i was very surprised when i recieved package only to find the total opposite of what i thought i had ordered.i am very displeased and will not order from there again.
0	Glad I read these reviews before I did buy, Thanks: Thanks to the ones that did the reviews. I was all ready to purchase one and I thought I would read some of the reviews, glad I did so I am not going to buy one. I will stick with RoboForm, it works good but it is software and you can't take it with you.Termite
0	Disatisfied: i purchased this item for my wife for xmas.BAD PURCHASE. IT DOESN,T WORK WITH VISTA, AND I SENT AN EMAIL To THE VENDOR ASKING IF I COULD EXCHANGE IT FOR ONE THAT WORKS WITH VISTA AND NOBODY EVEN BOTHERED TO ANSWER.SO IN THE FUTURE I WILL BUY LOCALLY.
0	FLEXCIN W/CM8 JOINT HEALTH & MOBILITY SOLUTION 90 CAPS: The name of the product is correct but the picture is wrong. The product name that is being given worked for me. I took this product and my knee feels great. After I stopped taking the product, I haven't had a problem with my knee yet. If I do have a problem, I would use this product again.
0	No More Eventing,Please!: I think the authors should stick to racing and I hope Christina doesn't go back to eventing,because she is a great jockey.
1	Getting better: The books are getting better, adding more details about the horses and stuff like that. I really hope that some more drastic changes happen soon in the next few books. This book was definately better than the few before it. READ!
0	Awful, boring, fragmented, and utterly lousy: The Dark Side of Genius: The Life of Alfred Hitchcock is a horribly written biography about the man himself. It is so wildly disjointed, incredibly fragmented, and surrounded by opinions, conjectures, and theories that don't collaborate well with facts. I am totally unable to follow the book because the author likes to jump around in the years of Alfred Hitchcock's life while feeding personal opinions about this or that. At the same time, there are more holes in the presentation of his background than a pound of Swiss cheese. What an awful book!
0	Looks great, but that's about it: I bought a 688B in November, and have used it twice on trips of 700 miles or so. It blows open at highway speeds - the front edge actually opens1-2 inches, allowing rain, snow, and ice to blow in. The mounting cleats also came apart after the first use. What was easy to install now takes two people and a lot of delicate alignment to match the parts up. Not at all what I would expect for what this box cost. I do not recommend it.
0	blue petal mist mister: product was okay, easily knocked over, this product has past it's time. Other items have taken it's place now. Truly, the first time my dog ran past it caplouey! on the floor it went pretty, but not practical
1	Wonderful way to spend a Sunday!: My family loves Agatha Christie and we especially love Poirot. This set of DVD's is a wonderful way to spend family time discussing the ins and outs of each show and each mystery. Give me more, give me more.
1	I love it!: Wow, this is good. I love this CD. The lyrics, Jessicka's voice, the guitars...it rocks. Each song sounds different for the last. I love it. Black Horse Ridding Star is my favorite. Very remescent of JOJ but a original sound. A must have for any JOJ fan.
0	A One-sided Report: To quote the late sacred elder of Western research and writing, C. Leland Sonnichsen, "I don't see why this book had to be written!" The reason is that the writer had pre-selected his conclusion and considered only information that tended to prove his prejudice. This is so obvious as to turn off an unbiased reader.Save your money. This book is unsliced baloney.
0	Piece of crap.: I bought this a while ago but as soon as I did it was crap, the stickers are oriented incorrectly. They feel off easily. When I received it it was unattached from the key chain. Is it cheep? Yes. Does that mean it's worth it? No.
1	Excellent! and Essential...: Too bad Amazon won't let me just say that for a review... So, with a few more words, let me say this is a great addition to Wyatt's regular CD catalog - 5 EPs covering his extra recordings and alternative takes from1974 to1998 sung in English, Spanish and in wordless instrumentals....divine.My favorite disc is the1st from '74 (it's been a while since I had a couple of these songs on a "Virgin Sampler" Lp). I just wish they had included a 6th disc of the lovely songs he did for the documentary Winged Migration. But, almost as good as the new music and mixes, are the liner notes by Wyatt; nice to get an intimate glimpse of it all from him.These are an excellent and even essential boxed set - if you know Wyatt you'll want to get this for sure, if you don't, this ain't a bad place to start.
1	Another face of Suwanai: The first half of this CD collects the melodious masterpieces, in particular, of Tchaikovsky and Rachmaninoff, while the last half does the maestro's ones. Therefore, 'Vocalise' is inserted between 'Romance' and 'Hungarian Dance,' because it is melodious as well as 'Romance.' The title implies that Suwanai likes the beautiful third part of Souvenir, 'Melody.' It surprised me because her maestro's play is famous, for example, the Violin Concerto of Tchaikovsky. Of course, 'Souvenir' of Wieniavsky here shows her maestro's character. However, she plays this Melody kindly and joyfully as if a young beautiful woman is humming. In spite of her maestro's character, she seems to love it heartly. It looks like another face of Suwanai.Technically speaking, 'Myth' of Szimanovsky fails to cooperate with the piano and at the last part of 'Vocalise' the strong violin seems to hide the beautiful stream of the piano. Despite it, '3 Melody' and '7 Vocalise' are worth listening once.
1	The Best Books I've Ever Read: These books are inspirational as well as life-changing. I recommend them to anyone and everyone
0	Unhappy Camper: I've only received one book at this point. I'll be very happy if I receive the other five that I ordered. Maybe they are still on the way I hope.
1	Good enough case but...: If you have a relatively inexpensive racket, then this case will do. It has a padded inside, but no strap to hold your racket in place. This is important because if your racket moves around a lot inside, the edges of the rubber can become damaged.If you have an expensive racket, I recommend you get a hard case, likeKillerspin Optima Racket Case - Choose ColororKillerspin Table Tennis Racket Case.
0	Inaccurate description: If you read the description of this product it clearly states that this item has a zippered pouch for carrying balls. The case I received looks like the one pictured but did not come with a zippered pouch. When I went to return it for what I ordered, Amazon would only issue a refund. Buyers beware, this description is inaccurate and misleading.
1	Finally something that doesn't disappoint!: For11 years we have owned a '97 Corolla and never found a sunshade that lasts for very long. They always begin to disintegrate, stop staying in, or just plain die. Blame the California sun.Just wanted something that was easy to install and remove, blocked most of the light and was *durable*. Finally it has arrived. This thing has been perfect, and as a rather picky consumer, I don't say that very often. It's the second one we've bought -- have already used a model that fits our Celica for16 months.If it costs three times as much, it's because it lasts at least three times as long (and lets through NO light). Will likely "pay for itself" in the long run. Try one and reward these fine people for solving a longstanding problem!
1	Understated Classic: This watch always looks appropriate. The combination of gold and stainless steel gives it an understated elegance. It is so comfortable on the wrist that you'll probably forget you have it on. I recieved this watch as a graduation gift in1996 and its still my favortie.
1	Good stuff.: Overall I like this DVD. She is high energy but not annoying...and she really gets you moving! I was actually surprised at some of the exercises - lots and lots of squats. But since she is pregnant too, it inspires you to keep up.
1	Finally a good book: Finally a good book on the subject of Rennes-le-Chateau! This volume deals with all hypotheses, theories and fantasies that have been written on this theme. In this way it sends (as it should've been done long time ago) most of the fairytales to the scrapheap untill the real naked facts are revealing itselves. What is left is that the priest Saunière suddenly spent a lot of money and nobody knows for sure where it came from. Most likely from selling masses that he never held and from gifts from rich people. Tales of a treasure that he found are most likely coming from a local hotelier Corbu that had to make the area interesting to visit for tourists, because there was not much else to come for. All together a very intriguing book that reads as a detective and seperates the crap from fact. A book that we all have been waiting for.
1	Pot Bellies and other Miniature Pigs: I have been looking for a good book about Pot Bellied Pigs for a long time, and I belive this book to be excellent. It is packed full of useful information and has the cutest pictures you will ever see. I recommend this book to any PBP owner if they are new to this wonderful pet or if they have had one for years. I don't believe that you will be disappointed.
1	Wonderful!: I picked this up on a whim and didn't read it right away, but I am sooo glad I finally did! I really enjoyed this book and I sometimes have a hard time being "captured" by a book. I tend to put them down unfinished and I read this in one day!! Excellent!
1	Not the best: If your getting started with this thinks this is a good beginning. its not the strongest but it certainly works.
0	wildside DVD: I had seen this movie previously on VHS and the DVD version seems to have deleted a couple of scenes (or at least one scene) and soI was disapointed.
0	hold your horses....: Ok...lousy script, main chick nothing special,16 minutes of most important stuff are missing etc.Violence looks really stupid as main character has more money than god.Police, as usual, violate law.
1	Perfect replacement: This is exactly what I needed. It is faster than the old one was when it was new so I give it points for that.
0	I am unhappy with this order: I bought this watch in the early september, 2012, but it did not work any more in the middle October, 2012. It stopped working even I screwed the crown! It can't be rewound manually. I am so disappointed! How can I get it fixed? I want to return it but I am in China now! It's not convenient to do that.
1	good buy: I had a surprisingly tough time finding a BASIC bow case. Grab this one while you can. Constructed pretty well and seems like it will last.
1	A great baseball game!!!: Its a great baseball game!!! My son and I have played some of the two player stuff and I am doing the single player career mode. Its been alot of fun. I would give it the max stars but that would state it is prefect which is just not possible. So it got four stars. :) Five stars for fun. :)
1	A Fun Game: I love the MLB series for the PS1 so I gave this a shot. It's fun to play, but the controls were a little difficult to figure out. Once I understood them, it was fun. It's worth getting if you are a baseball fan.
0	Obviously Defective - So Why Send It?: Nice looking machine, but obviously nobody even looked to see if it worked before sending it to me. #1 - It would not boot up in XP, just froze at every attempt. #2 - the battery would not charge, as clearly shown by the indicator light. I was able to fix the boot-up by going to Safe mode and running Defrag and Scandisk. The battery problem was not fixable - It is simply defective. Despite all the trouble, I'd still like to keep the machine, but there is no option to replace the battery only. There's no "Contact Seller" button available for this transaction and all I am left to do is return it. Whole effort - Waste of Time. I Hate Wastes of Time!
0	This device was a let down due to the problems in upgrading the hard drive. Do to buy this type in the future.: This device was a let down due to the problems in upgrading the hard drive. Do to buy this type in the future.
0	Initially impressed, would not buy it again.: After 6 months of very sporadic use our Pleo stopped working.All symptoms suggest battery or charger problem.To our surprise, we found out that Pleo is covered by 90 day warranty only.New battery is $50 plus s/h, new charger $25 + s/h, but I am not sure what is broken and I am not willing to spend more money on this thing.
1	Interesting Toy: Pleo, was a gift for my daughter (9yrs). She loves it. I had reviewed the consumer comments from Amazon and made the decition to purchase one. I was expecting the dinosaur to sleep for a long time (newborn stage) but within 3-4 hour Pleo was active. Know we download behaviors and see him act differently. I did purchase an extra battery because according to the comments at Amazon the batteries charge for10hrs. But that was not the case. They charge for 4hours. The only downfall is the "skin" it is very gentle and within1-2 days you can see wear and minor tearing were my daughter pets him. Reading the manual all you really need is to pat him, his sensor will pick up that you are touching him but to avoid any further damage we purchased dog attire to cover him. Overall, I love the toy and love to see my daughter discover something new about him.
0	Poore!: The battery is very bad, quality of the color surface is also bad, overall it doesn't meet my expectations.
0	Well, Let Me Tell You: This author must not have much value of herself by writing this book. She berates the family that she was born into, but excuses all the things she did in life. If she thought her home life was so bad, then why didn't she do something to better herself than sleep around, and then feel the need to tell the entire world about it. Maggie sounds like a very insecure person who wants people to feel sorry for her. Too bad she can't find the courage to make the world a better place to live in, instead of berating her family.
0	Once Twice ....NEVER AGAIN: First set i replaced with Bosch lasted a short time (I did not keep track) i bought a second set when the first went bad and then i did keep track .....2 years 3 months 7485 miles . my controller is working fine ! now i am shopping again FOR GLOW PLUGS MADE BY ANYONE ELSE !
0	Only 3 good songs.(in my opinion): I am a BIG Switchblade Symphony fan, and I was constantly hearing about their version of "Lucky Star", but I was a bit disapointed by it. The good points to this CD to me seem to be: "Erotica"(Razed In Black) "Skin"(I'm not sure who redid this one, I don't have the artist listing with me) and "Like a Prayer"(Biggod 20? ;o) ) If there is any reason to buy this cd, I would definately say it would be for the version of "Like a Prayer"; I couldn't get this version out of my head for days. I can't even listen to the version of "Cherish" anymore, or I'll pee my pants laughing. As immature as it sounds, I can't help myself.
0	False Prophets: Even a Madonna loyalist would flinch at most of these sad remixes. Testimony to the phrase "Don't fix what ain't broke."One would think that having a variety of Madonna songs sung by male vocalists would be an interesting change of pace. Well the pace has certainly changed but is interesting for all the wrong reasons.Most will have never heard of the selected bands offering these tributes and for good reason. It is unfortunate to have heard of them at all; far worse to hear them butcher these songs.Do yourself a big favor and just listen to Madonna get it right all over again on your old CDs.
1	It got rid of my appetite: I am glad Dexatrim came out with something to compete with other products. This product worked very well for me. I have tried Hoodia, but it gave me a headache. This product is mild and totally gets rid of my cravings for sweet, junk food.I've determined I definitely needed to take something to control my appetite while I am on an exercise regimine. I'm not jittery at all with this. It has lots of B vitamins and chromium picolinate. It has as much caffeine as one cup of coffee per pill. I brought this with me for a long business trip on a plane. When I had no access to food (long plane flight) it worked excellent! Plus, it's cheaper than many other products. Although, I would like to try NV next. The only thing is sometimes it keeps me awake at night if I take it too close to bedtime, so beware of that
0	Worked for one day: I am very open-minded and decided to give this product a chance - despite the reviews. I paid $22 for it and considered taking it back at first. The first day it worked all right but the second pill later in the day gave me a pressure headache. My appetite was suppresed mildly for the first two days but nothing the following days, in fact I felt hungrier, weird. I tried. Now I am trying NV.
1	Exactly what I needed: I got exactly what I wanted out of this product. I have had no problems and no complaints. I like that it came with an extra watch strap and battery. Overall no problems.
1	listening for years: These are masterpieces of the literature. Few 20th centurystring quartets are full of light. These are. The reviewer below (above) from Australia who mentions "atonal"is as far off the mark as one could get. These are supremely tonal pieces, in fact very conservatively so. In fact,there is not an atonal moment in them, they are more firmly rooted in tonal centers than even Bartok, Hindemith and Ravel quartets of the early part of the century. The comments about small fragments are correct however. These are mosaic structures of great beauty. Other quartets which are crafted similarly are those by Stravinsky. Imagine a more Slavic flavor and you have Janacek.
1	Arrived a week late: The hat is perfect, but the order arrived about a week overdue.Stupid word limit needs a lot more words.
1	Does what its supposed to do: Better than the ones that friends and neighbors have let me try. The fit is right; choose smaller. Lightweight. Not easy to get on and off but then there's a purpose to be served with this appliance and it has to fit tight to work. I am a high-mileage runner and have very narrow feet. My plantar fasciitis has been hanging around too long and nothing seems to be working so only time will tell if this is "the cure". I would recommend this splint.
1	AMAZING RELIEF!: This product MUST be tried to be believed. I actually received it through my doctor's office (not through Amazon) but you must know that after 4 years of pain so AWFUL that I could barely walk to school and pick-up my children and pain so HORRIBLE that I could not walk downstairs to wash laundry (I would have my kids running all over the place) - I have used THIS PRODUCT for1 week and my heel pain is almost gone in the morning. ALMOST GONE! How on earth is that? Because my foot is kept at a GENTLE 90 degree angle stretch. That's why. You will be amazed.My heel still becomes a little sore if I wear not padded shoes or if I am hiking...but THE NIGHT SPLINT has changed my life. It has given me hope and put me in a better mood!LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!Is it uncomfortable??? NO! Can you tell it's there...SURE but it's totally worth it!
0	Simply did not work: Simply did not deliver as promised. I went to the conference, and I found the theology to be unbiblical, useless and with no results. As usual, author blamed everything on lack of my faith etc...Advise: Seek God personally, there are no quick fixes. Anyone who promises you that is offering snake oil. Wallen was right about one thing, Jesus is the final authority and a relationship with the Holy Spirit is of vital importance. The rest is just his views and takes on the origins of soul and demons; which I found to be flawed, contradicting and non biblical.Before I went to the conference I had a good review posted up here, but after having seen for myself, I cannot agree with it anymore.
1	So warm and full of Christmas!: This sweet story is so charmingly illustrated and written. Cozy and thoughtful, full of love and Christmas spirit. We have loved this book year round, and value its message of the season.
1	Inventive music, no viola: I agree with the amazon.com review above, but should mention one error: there's no viola on the CD. In Brazilian Portugese, "violao" means acoustic guitar and "guitarra" means electric guitar. I don't know if that will trouble many listeners, though, given the clever mix of jazz and MPB on this CD. Two talented performers.
0	You get what you pay for..: I bought this headset for my sons for christmas who are 3yrs & 5yrs. These headsets were adjustable, but at the largest size were still totight on their little heads. These headsets must have been sized foran infants head instead of a kids head. Even my 3yr old couldn't wearthem. The two stars is only for the ability for the boys to talk to eachother, but they have to move the earphones up to their ears to hear sincethey can not wear them on their heads. You get what you pay for, so ifyou have kids with extremely little heads this is the headset for you.Otherwise get a better set and spend the extra $.
0	some interesting points, generally difficult to read: Perhaps the book is too specialized for me as amateur history-enthusiast (although i found this book via a recommended reading for1st year history students). I found this book tedious and often did not have much of an idea what point the author was trying to make here. I liked his discussion of the role of women and monasteries as institutionalized memory of medieval society.I am curious to see what others found of this book. I, for one, will not read this book again.
1	A charming picture book about the plucky Henrietta the Hen: Based on a true story of a girl's pet hen who would sneak into the family home through the cat door and lay an egg on the child's colored quilt, The Chicken Without A Coop by Kathleen Cameron is a charming picture book about the plucky Henrietta the Hen who, when left behind by her human family, befriends Columbus the Cat and his young owner Katy. Simple and inviting color illustrations by John Wilson add a special touch to this heartwarming story of acceptance.
0	A good plot concept that never carries through: This book was a serious disappointment. The delightful romance promised by the back cover cannot carry the rest of the dragging plot through. The biggest disappointment was the characters: the hero is thoroughly unlikeable and almost out of the regency mindset (what kind of "gentleman" would attempt to seduce a virginal lady?). The attempted interaction of the town people falls flat on its face, too. The few flashes of wittiness cannot make up for the wholly uninspiring content of the story.By the middle of the book, I just wanted it to be done. But I was on vacation with nothing else to read, so I finished it off. The ending makes up, perhaps, the rest of the book. But, in a regency, the ending is always good, so this is nothing unusual.
0	Trivial content makes for an incomplete reference: This book really isn't bad; it just seems so incomplete.It really does a good job of describing the changes to game that Planes of Power provides. All the level 60 plus spells are listed along with the high level disciplines. And the map section is useful, being limited to "lowbie" areas outside the major cities; occasionally handy to have all in one place. There is a decent description of many of the "new" planes, with a listing of monsters.It is not, however, a complete, "latest and greatest" reference to the Everquest game. In my opinion, an up-to-date, complete reference is sorely needed.
0	bad belt, don't buy it: it sucked! the plastic burned thru and i could smell the burning and the foam inside was burning as well
0	unecessary review: The cable is fine.The emails and this review are unecessary and a nuisance.please take me of any further mailing lists.If I have a problem I'll let you know.I personally feel advertising in America is intrusive and much too aggressive.Help me when I ask for it, then leave me alone.see ya,Oren
1	Great for the Acer Aspire One or any other Netbook out there!: I just ordered this last week and I love it, very snappy, plays DVD's burns CD's, you can boot an ISO from it in the BIOS no problem. Powered by the USB which is more awesome!This drive saved me a request for servicing my Aspire One, I just plugged it in, inserted the disk, booted my copy of Windows XP, fixed the Master Boot Record and I was back to normal.Great product, great seller.Make sure you DON'T PAY $79.99 for this. The other sellers have it for just $29.99 and it's worth every penny, these sellers are just as good as buying from Amazon directly, shipping wasn't bad either.
0	External drive: This unit looks good but came with no instructions and no ability to troubleshoot. There was always an error message stating: unknown device and unit requires an external power supply to function properly.
0	A bit much...: The Simon Weisenthal Center and the Jewish Defense League compiled the statistics for this report. That said, it should be stated that the "bias" level is a tad high. The reader is subjected to page after page of dry statistics accompanied by text that borders on being hateful itself. Details like political climate, economics and cultural trends are brushed over in favor of a self-serving agenda. I critiqued this book/survey rather harshly because their are so many other books that give a much better account of global Neo-Nazi activity and manage to be informative and objective at the same time.
1	Russian Spectacular music at its best: Divine voice. If only I understood russian. I have had prior 2 or 3 CDs both vocals and non-vocal of russian spectacular music. This tops them all. The voice of Dimitri Hvorostovsky is simply divine. Highly recommended for anyone who appreciates a great voice and russian popular songs.
1	Ordinary Joy: Prior to my reading Ordinary Joy, had Jesus Christ walked right up to me, I most cetainly would have missed Him. Now there is a chance that I will recognize Him every day for the rest of my life. This read has truly made me feel loved by God.
0	Waste: It's simply an aweful item. I bought it brand new, with no scratches, but the disc behaved like I had scratched it up terribly. It would skip all over. We could never finish a game because it would just return to the main menu after half way through any game. Maybe I just got a faulty disc but if not, the item is terrible.
0	Fun as you want to make it: The theory of this game is fun, but it really is based on the1960's game. The people in the video are from that era and the culture of the questions as well. It was fun because we all got silly about the questions, but an updated version would be awesome.
0	Not what was advertised: When I ordered this game I thought I was getting the new up to date version. The description is misleading.
1	PAINTS PICTURES: Great artwork and very creative production. Check out the video which is on the CD. As good as his other albums and has created his own niche. Would like to hear more of Allan's vocal ability and possibly some chorus's. Otherwise delighted with this imaginative piece of work.
0	A big let-down: As a fan I couldn't wait to get my greasy little fingers on the new release from the talented Mr Wilder. Well,what a disappointment. He seems besotted with narrative(which is highly effective and evocative in small doses)which rages and groans across virtually every track on what could have been a superb album,with its eerie backdrops of creepy samples and various other suitable noises. The previous release was more accessible,especially the vocals.This one is rather overpowering,and the only tracks that succeed are 'Want", 'Vertigen' and 'Black box part 2'. Alan Wilder should ditch the awful rappers and concentrate more on his creative keyboards.
1	Paris Bistro comes to US: I have been to Paris and am familiar with several of the bistros profiled in this book. Their cookery is FABULOUS!! Ms. Danenberg has chosen well and the recipes are not only delicious but very satisfying. I can now bring Paris bistro cooking home!
0	Side Effects?: I have a 25lb beagle that is a little over a year old. I had previously given 3 drops of the calming treatment but had seen no effect. Recently, a good friend of mine moved into my apartment and caused a bit of anxiety in my dog. I gave her 4 drops and she was fine for the rest of the night. The following day however, she was very lethargic and not very responsive to play and yawned an unusually large amount. As with the other review on this product, my dog also had muscle spasms or tremors. It was not really clear what they were. If purchasing this product, i would definitely be very careful with the amounts and see how dogs react. Honestly, i have been using pet naturals calming treats instead and they work just as well and have no side safest i have seen of.
0	I'll Wait for CDs: The makers of this product need to "modernize" it and make it available on CDs. Till then, I'll just wait.
1	Must-read for African Missionaries!: This book is an overview of the truths of the Christian faith as seen from the perspective of the traditional African world view. It is insightfully written from a Western perspective and is extremely helpful in understanding the difficulties of relating Christianity to the African's beliefs -- both modern and indiginous. This is a must-read for anyone going into the mission field in Africa, no matter how much theology you've studied or how much you already know about African religions. Great for general knowledge or to look in-depth at specific issues.
1	Musee d'Orsay: High quality art book that is not intimidating or daunting. It is not a "reference piece"; it is an enjoyable trip through the museum. Just enought text and detail to let you enjoy/explore/experience each piece of art.
0	poorly done!: i just found this dvd annoying. The music attempts to evoke the feeling of a young trendy viewer, although the narrator sounds like Robin Leach. Most of the suggestions, boutique and hotel- wise are for tourists with 'beaucoup bucks' to spend, not very practical! This guide shows more of the inside of premises' than the outdoor scenery, and left me feeling empty. It does give you a nice 2-minute glimpse of the canal, street and park views but not nearly enough.
0	THIS CHANNEL NEEDS TO GO OFF AIR!: This was one of the worst serial killer thrillers I have ever read. I found the entire novel incredibly boring, sluggish, and unsuspenseful. The main character, Lucas Frank, was poorly developed and Felix, the killer, did not seem like a good candidate for a serial killer. It was a good thing that this novel was short because, the book was not exciting and seemed to take a long time to get through, even though it was only 322 pages. I did not like the ending either. I felt John Philpin did not do a good job with the conclusion of this novel. There were so many flashbacks throughout the entire novel that it drove me crazy. I have read many good novels this year, but "The Murder Channel" was definitely not one of them. Be smart and save your money.
1	Love: We love this puzzle! It's way cute! The colors are so vibrant and I love the large block style puzzle pieces, they are much more durable!
0	Should Be Extinct: I was so excited to get this puzzle for my little ones. Unfortunately, the item description is misleading. The puzzle looks nice (before the kids get to it) and the chunky pieces were a perfect size! However, this puzzle is NOT hand painted. The puzzle pieces are just faced with a sticker, that easily comes off (in pieces!). That is not the quality I was expecting, especially from Melissa and Doug. I've had the puzzle for 2 months now, and 2 or 3 of the pieces have the stickers mostly peeled off.
1	Amazing book, just the kind I was looking for.: I have been interested in European Indian relations for almost a year now, and I have read many books on the subject. This book is great in the way that if gives you,1. a chronicle of the Indians from before Columbus to present.2. For the most part a non bias account of the events that shaped European and Indian relations. It talks about what the Indians got out of working with the Europeans and motives for converting.3. A vast amount of illustrations, maps and primary documents about important events.Instead of looking for another book about Euro-Indian relations just get this one. It is a textbook but trust me it is a great source and answered all of the questions I had.
1	Overall good phone: I've had this phone for about a year now. As a phone its pretty good as far as voice quality and reception. It fits well in the palm of the hand and in pocket. The keyboard is very handy for entering info into the phonebook. The Camera also takes good pictures for a phone camera.My phone did have an issue with charging and retaining charge of the battery (as also mentioned by someone else in their review). I took it to a local T-Mobile store and they filled out a warranty form to get it exchanged and received a replacement in 4 days. So far no problems with the replacement phone.Overall functions very well as a phone and is very stylish. Just watch out for potential issue with charging and retaining charge
0	Inherent batter problem: This phone did not charge after about a month of use. I sent it in and got a new one. Now the new one won't charge either. This could be a model misdesign.
1	Magia de las frutas y vegetales: Salud cocina y belleza: I purchased this book for my mother because she had checked it out at her library and love it. She has made several recipes out of the book and she says they are delicious and easy.
1	INCREDIBLE: I don't know what these reviewers are talking about. First of all the package is by Philips not Sony. I don't hear any hiss at all when I listen to it (is this reviewer talking about the right one?) Also I think the comparison with Gould is bad. These partitas made little impression on me when I heard Gould play them. When I heard Tureck play them it was like a revelation. She plays Bach with a soul, they breath and live. Listening to these recordings brings in euphoria. These recordings are some of the most beautiful I have in all my piano cds. They are like magic. I have lots of other Bach cds including Gould and Fischer, but these partitas are what I come back to again and again. I don't want to criticize Gould on Bach because he is a genius; but if all you heard is Gould then you don't know Bach. Gould and Tureck play Bach differently and they are both worth hearing. Sorry my personal preference for Bach is this CD, It is my favorite. Strongly recommended.
0	Read this book together with Dan Neuharth's book: Al Neuharth's son, Dan Neuharth, has written a book called: "If You Had Controlling Parents: How To Make Peace With Your Past and Find Your Place In the World" [...]If you read the son's book first and then read this book, you will find Al Neuharth's view of himself as "lovable" quite a fantasy. The son's book is excellent help for adult children of narcissistic parents, and quite well reviewed, unlike this book.I'm not sure that success in business or publishing even requires the enormous betrayals Al Neuharth performed to others in his industry or to his family.
0	Powerbrush has failed twice: After 6 months the Powerbrush failed and was replaced for free, that brush lasted10 months before it too failed. The cost of the replacement is more than the original vacuum! Also the suction capability of the cleaner was less than desirable. Bag-less is nice, but overall it's a disappointment and now useless.
0	Loved it - Hated it: I own a small residential cleaning company and bought two of these. They worked great on carpet, and they look pretty cool, too. Easy to open to get rid of the dirt and debris and not too loud. But both broke within 2 months. Both of the hoses pulled away (fixed with a hose clamp) and the way the debris container fits into the body of the vacuum - you have to tilt it very slightly then pull it out - it was a given that someone was going to pull it straight out and break off the little plastic piece eventually - which they did. Going for something a little more substantial next time, although I think these might be good for someone with mostly carpeting, who lived in a ranch-style house with only one floor (a bit heavy to carry up stairs).
1	Awesome Set of Lights at an affordable price: i just purchased 2 of these lights to add to my set up and they are awesome, I also purchased the eliminator tri 32 light stand to go with these lights definately a good product for any budget.
0	waste of time and money: Nothing on this cd is even close to his other stuff ! Gay Robot is the only kinda funny track. Dont bother buying this !!
0	A failed attempt to improve on an old standard: I bought this cord because I was tired of the way the plastic lip always breaks on the Canon version and this one has a metal plate on the mount instead of plastic, so I thought that might solve the problem. The metal plate is a good idea, but the way the head is mounted on the plate with a screw, it got loose the first weekend I used it and there was no way to tighten it, so the flash and mount wobbled and spun around on the screw. Not helpful.
0	Irving and History: Buyer Beware!: See:"Denying the Holocaust", Deborah Lipstadt (1993)"Lying about Hitler", Richard J. Evans (2001)"Evidence for Auschwitz: Evidence from the Irving Trial", R. J. Van Pelt (2002)David Irving sued Lipstadt in British court for libel. Richard Evans was an expert witness for Lipstadt. Evans' book chronicles the trial and presents overwhelming evidence (under oath and with cross examination) that Irving's entire body of work is riddled with falsehoods and outright fabrications. See the Amazon reviews of Evans' book.

1	Nice book!: I ordered this book for my class and was very pleased when it arrived! My students will appreciate all of the pictures it contains! The price was also great! Thank you!
0	yup, this thing stinks: It rewinded the first tape ok, except the START button wouldn't stay down. I had to keep the button down with my finger.But on the second tape STOP button got stuck and somehow it eat the tape.I got it from radio shack, it's going back there tomorrow.
1	What Happened to My Rebate?: I was supposed to get a $30 rebate on this, as a renewing customer with Norton SystemWorks, but the system never offered it to me. It seems to have been a shill that never came through -- emphasized in the promo headline, but never offered in a tangible way I could take advantage of. [...]
0	It's like stealing!: You buy the program (SystemsWorks 2005), and when you try to use it you get error messages that some of the files didn't install. Try over again, you're told. It was a chore the first time. So you try to get in touch with Symantec, via email or otherwise. Forget email for techical help. "Otherwise"--that'll cost you $30 for a program out of the box only a few hours and you can't get to work for faults in their program.. I've used Norton from the time he first started out, and he was good, excellent. Now, maybe he's too rich and doesn't care.Terribly frustrated
0	Misleading Product Description: Item Description claims a power output of140 watts continuous,150 watts for 20 minutes and 500 watts peak. Packaging on this inverter claims 85 watts contiuous, 85 watts for10 minutes and170 watts peak. DO NOT PURCHASE IF YOU REQUIRE MORE POWER !!!
0	not working at all well...: new 2350 ..does not print. lexmark web page does not list this model?? so can not look at FAQ and "online support" has not responded with a solution ..so far I have waited 27 hours for their response. Booklet shows no example of what test page should look like? nor does the website...wish I could bill them for my time ...so far a definate 2 thumbs down ..will probably return this tomorrow?
0	Redo's and Such Stuff: Well, it's as bad music as you might think but its up to you how bad.The Byrds, Mr. Tambourine Man must of redone by their original equipment manager!The Animals, The House of the Raising Sun was no better off than the mentioned above.Gerry & The Pacemakers, How Do You Do It was reduced to a instrumental with no vocals at all...OMG.Their disclaimer: "Some of the tracks are re-recordings made by the original artists or a member of the original group. This album also includes some live-recordings"This is unworthy of your attention or moneyWalk by this quickly.
1	THIS BOOK IS AWESOME!!!!!!!: Jack on the tracks is and awesome book and I think everyone should read it!!! I don't want to give any of the book away but if you read this you will be howling with laughter after the first few chapters!!!!!!!!!! I loved this book so much that I'm writing 2 reports on it for school. A salute to Jack Gantos for writing a great book!!!!!
1	The wack jack: Jack on the Tracks is a funny book . If you enjoy anything funny then this is a good book to read . My favorite part is when Jack was watching the news and lightningstruck their t.v. Jacks mom was screaming her head off while smoke was coming out of their t.v. Or when his cat froze to death because it got stck in the freezer.If anyone enjoys a good laugh I would recommend this book to them .
0	Inconsistent flashes: For the first couple weeks it worked ok, only sometimes flashed at consistent intervals at the really low setting. Now however, it's only consistent at the highest settings and hardly works at the lower ones. I guess it's what you get for the price.
1	Beautiful Disney Movie Song Instrumental Lullabies: I was tired of listening to the same Baby Einstein Lullaby cd over and over again while getting my little one to sleep. This Disney Instrumental Lullaby cd is perfect! It has numerous Disney movie songs turned into beautiful instrumental lullabies. It's very soothing and not too loud or fast. I highly recommend it!
1	Great CD: My 3 year old little princess loves this cd. She listens to it for almost every nap and wants to fall to sleep with it at night too. Very pretty and relaxing music. Would highly recommend!
1	WONDERFUL!!!!: Coming from a music fanatic this is the best!! Great background music for life. I even play this when we have company. Everyone is familiar with these classics. My children all love it. Sometimes to jazz things up we sing along (it is instrumenatl only). I have never rated anything on Amazon but when I heard this I just had to write about it. Hope this was helpful. I have wasted a lot of money on CD's that were a dissapointment.Love this CD!!
1	One of our daughter's favorites: We gave this to our daughter for Christmas, when she was18 months old. She loves it, and it has helped her learn shapes. She hasn't had any interest in the page with the alphabet yet. The flaps in the book (with the exception of just one) are holding up well with all the wear. This is a great book to take on long car rides. Lots to keep a little one interested, and all in one piece.
1	My Grandson loves Thomas: This was no exception,he will watch these over and over.The toy train is an added bonus.For the price you can't go wrong.
1	Buy this DVD: If you're thinking about buying this or even if you're not, do yourself a favor and buy this DVD. You won't be disappointed, the production quality is top notch, the concert is excellent, and the documentary is funny and interesting.
1	Clarke Boland Of Course: The Clarke Boland Orchestra were never really known in the USA. Kenny Clarke - American drummer with Francy Boland - Belgian piano player and composer along with a mixture of international musicians was a group of stunning interpreters of jazz. Three Latin Adventures is one of their more unusual choices but the compositions and the playing is very tight and if you love jazz with a latin flavour then do not miss this cd.
0	Save your money: Let me come straight to the point. This stuff is garbage. Please save your hard earned cash, and purchase something different. This does nothing to remove or repair scratches. If you want to waste10 dollars, you can rip up a10 dollar bill and flush it down the toilet. If I could rate this item as zero stars, then I would.
0	Not that great at strengthing...good at breaking nails though!: I have been looking for a more natural nail treatment that could strengthen my nails. I started to use this product when my nails started to get longer, but instead of strengthening my nails, I found they were more prone to breaking.And the way my nails would break would be in like a straight line as if they were cut. It didn't look jagged or ripped off at all, which meant I didn't have much loss of my nails or a good deal of cutting/filing in order to fix my nail.I am going to look for a better nail treatment because this one is causing me problems that I have never had before and don't want to have again. It could just be my nails, but if you do try this out, you have been warned!

0	I wish I had followed the advice of other reviewers: Avoid this book unless you crave corny and woefully outdated 'insults' and 'jokes' (which were anything but funny). Have not read other books of this genre, so I cannot make a recommendation of another title. My only recommendation is NOT to buy this book.
1	The First "Men In Black": In1952, the author, Albert Bender, founded one of the first organizations to seriously study flying saucers. Starting in New England, his organization quickly grew to be an international network of observers and information gatherers until -- Bender told them all to stop! He claimed that he had come too close to the truth and now was in danger from -- the men in black. What did he find out? Why are they here? Mankind must be warned. Read this terrifying book!
1	It helped me heal: I loved this book! Even though I cried through much of it, it served a useful purpose. After never wanting to have children, I had a revelation that I needed to experience the joys of motherhood. I recently had a miscarriage with my first and much wanted pregnancy. I was a mess. This book helped me get over some of the loss I felt. I still feel sad often but realize that I'm not supposed to "Just get over it, already!" The book was honest, sad, hopeful, real, and made me totally feel like I was not alone in my grief. I am hopeful and anxious to finish this book by reading the chapters about trying again, coping with a subsequent pregnancy and birth, and the other chapters I know one day I will read when I feel ready to embark on the scary but exciting journey of pregnancy. I also feel compelled to share this with anyone who has gone through the death of a child. Thank you Deborah Davis, Ph.D. for the gift of this book!
1	fun!: These shoes are sexy and comfortable. For sure fun for your special someone. I got them right on time and they were even hotter in person. I think they make legs and feet look better than other HIGH HIGH heels I have bought before.
1	excellent gore movie: sorry but creep is an excellent horror movie lots of gore blood and creeping section is very ok i've seen it twice already and the second vision is better i bought the england dvd before and i recommend this movie to all amateurs of gore bye marc
0	THIS ITEM IS NOT A BOOK!: This is a box set of stationery with some of the same illustrations as the Mouse Tales books--this is NOT the books themselves! The product description doesn't clearly indicate this.Very cute--but if you're looking for the books themselves, don't buy it.
0	not what I thought it was gonna be: They definately should have had pics of the inside of the bag...that way I would have known that it wasn't a case. If it would have been a case it would have been a beautiful one. So sorry to have to send it back...but totally not what I had expected.
1	Simple product for remembering: Well made bag and labeled for easily finding your wheel locks. Leave the bag in your glove box or attach the velcroe strap to the cars' tire tool for easy finding.
1	Good tool at a good price.: This is a low end miter saw that works just fine. I like this saw because it is light weight and can be hauled around for smaller jobs. I give this saw 5 stars because in the same price range you are looking at either Ryobi or Firestorm(black and decker).....I would say Hitachi has the better reputation and my experience with the Hitachi brand has been good.As far as the instruction booklet? I only opened it to see that I received all included parts. I only had to install a few items which took 5 minutes. Perhaps the one I got from Lowes was pre-assembled? The1 star rating seems unfair for that considering the limited tools required and parts included.I can't comment on the table mounts (as others have) since I probably will only use it as a small portable.
1	For light duty work, great saw.: Considering Home Depot wanted like $120 to rent a saw for a week this is a no brainer if you have a big home project to do. I have put down about 240 feet of baseboard cut with this saw without any problems or complaints. The baseboard I am using is the fiberboard preprimed stuff. The blade that comes with the saw worked great, no tear out or chipping. Not sure about real wood, I have a feeling a different blade would be needed for that. Now, as I stated in the title, I believe this to be a light duty saw, occasional weekend projects that sort of thing. Don't think it would stand up to the daily strain a contractor would put it through.
0	Sad, sad, sad: I was so excited to get this book and then realized it was really advertising for the book clients are to use. If you flip through this book you will see on each page the authors site their book SO MANY TIMES.... we are educated people and they can't stop citing the book we are reading. Not very helpful sadly.
0	I've read worse, but I've read better too.: The book: Lie to Me is one that I am quite torn on. On the one hand, it deals with subjects that I wasn't too comfortable reading, and as such, almost didn't finish it.On the upside though, it does have a surprise ending that you could easily miss figuring out through the book if you're not paying attention. (Though personally I think that the author gives way too many hints at the big secret. I had it figured out about 2/3 way through the book)Worth a read, but get it from the library.
1	the butcher's deadly crew: Wall to wall gore and brutality.Was I glad when this one was finally over? You bet.Not certain how much of this actually happened the way they claim,but it sure as hell seems to me the writers come mighty close.Might turn some stomachs, might leave others numb--or both.Makes the characters in The Godafather look like boy scouts.
0	True only if pigs fly: One would think that the authors of this book, being employed or having been employed by reputable newspapers, would know to check their facts. Their "true" story is at least partly fiction. Told through the perspective of a biased bystander with limited intelligence and perception, the "facts" as they pertain to at least one of the characters are almost completely fictitious. There are other factual errors that are glaring. It seems Mustain and Capeci had no problem sacrificing journalistic integrity to the gods of sensationalism and profit. The authors and publisher should be grateful that they were not sued for libel.
1	MURDER MACHINE: IT'S ABOUT MY DAD AND HIS FRIENDS.IT'S TRUE AND PAINFULL.IF YOU WANT TO READ ABOUT THE "REAL" GANGSTERS, THIS IS THE BOOK.WHEN BAD BOY GOTTI IS AFRAID, THEY WERE BAD FELLOWS.
1	Absolutely off da hook!: As usual, Willie Ninja does it again. This man should be deemed the king of house...
0	Eh, could do without this one.: Thought this would be great, liked the graphics, thought Pandora kicked butt, but not so thrilled now that I have played it. Great for teens, probably, but not me. Going to try to sell it to GameStop.
0	purely contrived & cliched: generic songs, cheezy lyrics, stereotypical in every way. Priest initially invented the heavier aspects of metal in the late 70s early 80s...had their last truely creative and heaviest album in1984 (defenders of the faith)...after that they took 2 years off. They saw the trends in metal change to bonjovi,poison,etc...so they copied that formula for turbo and ram it down purely to sell records. most fans didnt accept that. After that, they decided, well then lets go back to being heavier...but by the late 80s heavier was slayer, anthrax, etc. So they copied that formula as well. But once again it's so phony and generic, just to sell records. Bottom line is they sold out after 84's defenders album, and priest ceased to be priest after that.
0	horrible: this is one of priests worst albums, nightcrawler is only good for12 year old kids, leather rebel is horrible. for a good priest album buy 'sad wings of destiny.'
1	ONE SHOT OF THE GREATEST GLORIES OF PRIEST!!!: THe Gods Takes the NWOBHM (New Wave Of British Metal) To Thrash/Speed! With Scott Travis, A Much Better Drummer, No Afence on Dave he was good too. Nice Starting! A way To Introduse Us To Is Drumming Power! The Guitar Sounds Powerful To! This Is Worth Listening too! If You Don't Have it, Hurry Up And Get It Damn You cause your missing the Metal Fun!
1	Orgainized!: I saw this shelf at a friends house and thought it was a great idea! It does a nice job at organizing small pieces and parts of toys while having them in view, so my son can grab the bin he wants.Assembly literally took10 minutes, but was easiest with two people.The only thing we didn't like is the whole thing is so light, we had to anchor it to prevent my child from pulling it down on himself.
1	Real-Life examples: This book rocks, its probably the best math book i have ever used, it has lots of real life problems, along with lots of pictures and information to help you learn! Great job larson and staff!
1	Bulbs are Cheap; Batteries are Not: Okay, the light wedge is really the best book light on the planet, and I think I have purchased every light on the market. Yet, it uses batteries fast, especially if you tend to fall asleep with the light on and it burns most of the night. :)The Original Itty Bitty is the best for at-home use. You plug it in near the bed and no worry about batteries. Eventhough I leave it on, nothing has caught afire.I had one for years and finally it refused to light, the charger I think. Nothing is perfect, and nothing lasts forever. This is pretty darned close.Be glad it's still available.
0	Come on already!: Enough of these money hungry pigs! Enough of this season 4 vol.1 Or season1 vol.2 crap! Give us the complete series in one package already. And make it so us common folk can afford to buy this series that we love! PLEASE!!!
1	Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea - Season Three, Volume Two: Great to see the old series reborn. Once again a great job by Amazon.Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea - Season Three, Volume Two
0	NOT INTENDED FOR CONSUMPTION!: Not tasty... and almost impossible to chew at all! Items are pretty, but seriously, have no taste and are like chewing rubber.
1	Awesome: These are the greatest things in the world. At the prices on Amazon you can't loose. Definatly a good buy.
1	Very Useful: I don't know about you, but I have neither the financial resources, time, or particular desire to try and keep up with the novels. FASA realizes this, so they give us Shattered Sphere.Basically, this book is a status update, similar to the long-out-of-print 30-year Update book, published just before the Clans appeared. It doesn't go into great detail on anything, but is very general about everything. It's told from the point of view of Victor Steiner-Davion's intelligence chief, so there is a bit of bias there (i.e. Draconis Combine's okay, but the Capellans and Katherine Steiner-Davion are EVIL).It's a very, very handy book. It should be a required purchase for anyone who owns Mechwarrior 3rd edition, and if you're at all interested in the politics behind the universe, for Battletech fans, too. If there'd been more (like, say, if it'd been twice the size), it'd've gotten five stars.
0	Yuck!: I love Boba, but when I recieved this product- one of the bags the seal was broken and the pearls were desintegrated. When I opened the other bag these also fell apart. The color and texture were not what I had recieved before when I mail ordered from another company. (Can't find them now.)Since I paid alot to mail them, I just took it as a loss. Not worth the time and trouble to mail back. I would not recommend this stuff.
1	File Under "Guilty Pleasures.": The1980s were cheesy enough in terms of bad fashions, big hair, and Reganomics, but "80's Engergy" takes things to a whole new level. Johnny Budz compiles playfully tacky dance remakes of classic hits of the1980s, and the result is a qualified guilty pleasure. Collage speeds up the tempo of George Michael's "Careless Whisper" and turns it into a Eurodance treat, while Goldfinger gives an underground trance makeover of the Human League's "Don't You Want Me." But a couple of these covers are hilariously bad. Moogue performs the most unusual act of cruelty by butchering David Bowie's "China Girl," and DJ Silver don't cover "Always On My Mind" nearly as well as Pet Shop Boys did in1987. Still, "80's Energy" is fun enough to make you bring out the skinny tie, the "Flashdance" soundtrack, and that Atari 5200 that's collecting dust in your attic.
0	Itty Bitty lasts itty bitty time: I have had both the original and the volume 2 book light. Both lights developed shorts in the wiring that cause the light to flicker --- very annoying. The light will not stay upright and flops down to the page. Have the same problem with both lights. I am looking for a new book light without an arm to flop or wires to bend.
0	flash in the pan: I purchased this company's first book light and had many of the same problems that others have reported -- fast bulb burn up, shoddy connections and very high bulb replacement costs. This latest version suffers from the same.
0	Not Itty Bitty: This item is anything but itty bitty. The actual light part appears sleak enough and will attach to your book etc., but there is a sencond part...the battery compartment, which requires four, count 'em, four "C" batteries. It apparently is supposed to sit on your lap or something. Very cumbersome.
0	stopped working right away: I ordered this used.It looked pretty new when I received it.Within a week or so it stopped working.I sent it back.I ordered a brand new one this time.Have only used this one a few days.So far...so good.
1	Robert Ross has the Chops: I have been a fan of Robert for over twenty years. I have seen him play in small clubs and back up such greats as Muddy Waters and John Lee Hooker. His lighting fast solos and great slide playing are truly amazing and he does all this and is as clean a player as I have ever seen. This first major release is a good effort by Robert with good original tunes and some fine covers. Robert has at last started to get the recognition he so long has deserved, play both the Chicago Blues Festival and the Montreal Jazz and Blues Festival this year. The CD is well worth a listen, but do your self a favor catch him live. You will be blown away.
1	Handy and good value: With a wide door, this was a good find. Good value, sufficiently adjustable, looks good and functions well.
0	Over the door Hook in Black: I'm not very happy with it because I wasn't aware that it was for a thick door and my door is not as thick so I had to adjust it but it doesn't look the way it's supposed to look. I feel that the seller should have stated that it was for a thick door.
1	The Trial Book To Read: PRIDE BEFORE THE FALL relays the trials of Microsoft from a different point of view than Auletta's account. Heilemann's access to the key players, many of whom are unknown to the general public and received nary a headline, is just excellent. If you're going to read only one book about the Microsoft trials, this is it.
0	whiny: This book is more of a whine session than an informative look into the microsoft case. Poor writing and questionable facts make this book impossible to read. Save your money!
1	Great bird guide addition: I think this book is a great book for birders. It helped me learn birds by where I was (habitat), where in the past I had no real way of having core knowledge to build on for what birds I would see based on what type of habitat I was in (I'm not an expert birder). I've never seen another field guide done this way and I think it's a great way to catagorize birds.The pictures are great and the stories along with the identification info make this book a good read. I really enjoyed the Raven and Wolf story.I recommend birders add this book to their collection.
1	Good product!: The Lennmar batteries are a good value. I find they are just as good as OEM batteries at a much reduced cost.
0	Disappointment: I am so disappointed with this software. It crashes and seems to be extremely sluggish. I expected much better from a product that costs so much. I need to be able to create scripts for my clients, so I don't know what I'm going to do. But I may have no choice at some point to buy something else. I've got to get my work done and not have to constantly be frustrated with the way the software stumbles along.
0	No. Just, no.: If you like seeing a camera taped to a rotating fan for 70% of the movie...Then this movie is for you. So many flaws also. It's1988 and it looks to be filmed in HD. The overall setting looked to be in todays world. The first two sucked, so I shouldn't be surprised this one does too. It brings absolutely nothing new. Leaves unaswered questions that will probably wont get answered. The only thing that was good, was the littlest girls acting. Two stars just for her.
0	SUCKS!!!!!!!: I hate all these extremely low budget scary movies that are filmed in a home-movie style with cheap camcorders. The scary parts of this movie mainly consist of loud bangs in the dark and household objects being thrown around. This feels like only half of a movie because the ending explains nothing. This movie is trash. Don't watch it.
1	Do NOT open the door...: Being a fan of the first two movies, I had high hopes for this one. While I didn't find this to be the scariest of the bunch, it is still enjoyable. Don't get me wrong though, it definitely has it's scary moments (bloody mary scene anyone?). If you're like me, you thought you had a fairly good grasp of the story based on the first two films...this one just opens up a whole can of worms. The ending is relatively confusing and leaves a lot of questions unanswered...which leads into the inevitable sequel. Over all if you liked the first two, you'll probably like this one...and if you didn't like them then you'll probably hate it.
1	Paranormal Activity 3: DIFFINATLEY a great addition to the franchise. The whole movie is utterly entertaining and followed an amazingly smart storyline. Has quite a few moments in witch the viewer will JUMP out of fear! The ending is also like the others leaving you with questions to be answers and needing a change of underwear. I highly recommend this movie and Conno pack especially if you liked the first two!!
0	Very, very cheap quality: Sure this thing is only around $20, but this thing was built horribly. I had to snap the buttons back into the metal face plate as they were coming out from the factory. After a few times of switching button #1, it failed and wouldn't turn off. Another button stayed partially illuminated even when off. This is junk, stay away.
0	DO NOT BUY THIS GAME: This is a horrible game, I mean it is just down right stupid. The fish are a real pain to catch and the line always snaps on the weakest fish when you are fishing. On top of that the game has the WORST music I have ever heard. The controls are odd and the graphics STINK. The worst part is trying to pick out the right bait to use. The are over 30 kind of bait and only one kind works for each fish. So the whole time you are trying to pick the right bait when the timer is going down. To get new levels you need to beat challenges which are impossible. You get WAY to little time catch a lot of really rare fish. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY BUY A BETTER GAME. !GOOD TIMES!
1	teaching with the brain in mind: I was looking for a practical guide to use in teaching and the majority was practical.
0	No Real Difference To Nails: Well, I've been applying this product 2-3 times a day to my stumpy toenails which never seem to grow past the quick for almost a full month now. I've followed the instructions carefully (massaging the oil into the nail and cuticle), but my nails are still super short and janky.I did notice that they seem more supple/flexible than before.I've also applied to to my fairly normal fingernails as I go and though they aren't growing any father than usual, the tops do seem a bit smoother. Overall, not the best product if you're trying to grow sandal-worthy nails in a short period of time. It does seem like it would be nice for people with brittle, flaky nails, though!
1	Wonderful!: Get it if you are even thinking about this! So versatile, beautiful, and comes in a set. What else can you ask for?
1	Good not great: The quality is lacking with this set. The edges on the spoons are a little sharp. The major defect is that the spoon has a bur at the end. Blemishes are present on 2 other pieces. Ill keep them but no taste testing from these.
1	The Best Sour Candy EVER!!!: I first ate this many years ago as a teen. It was the best sour candy I had ever had. By far better than the sour candy out there today. I bought some for my son for Xmas and he loves them. He has since passed them all out to his friends and now I'm on a new batch for him. You won't regret purchasing this candy.By the way, you don't want to eat the whole bag.It's not good for your tongue!LOL! And be prepared to watch people pucker and cry!
0	An average song by an average band: This song is well tolerable. I am not a fan of the spice girls but i suppose if you are a fan that this song would most likely appeal to you as it is better than most of its predecessors
1	Worth the time I spent searching!: I saw a mother using this when my son was only a couple of months old, and thought "Hey, that's cool". When it came time to find a solution to my son's inability to sit on his own in the grocery cart (he outgrew his car seat at 4 months), I had a hard time finding this. Finally, I met a woman with one, and she provided the manufacturer's name. I bought one, and plan to purchase them as gifts for all of the new parents I know. It's good to have early, because the baby will need it before you realize! We also use this in the high chair at our favorite restaurant. They have a decrepit old chair that I refer to as the "Chair of Death". This pad and strap make it work for our son though. I strongly suggest purchasing this and carrying it with you everywhere. It's quite portable and handy!
1	Great seat for young children: I have used this seat extensively with my youngest daughter, now one, and have found it to be priceless at keeping her secure and safe from the yucky things one finds on shopping carts. I would highly recommend this to any new mom who prefers to use store shopping carts to keep their babies comfortable and safely seated.
1	a must have!: This is a great item -- register for it -- you will need it as soon as your child is out of the infant carrier car seat! which my daughter was out of already at 4 mths (she's very long and outgrew the height requirement). The secure me travle seat works great -- it is easily adjustable and works in many situations (regular chairs, restaurant high chairs, carts, etc.)
0	Not what I expected...: As a graphic artist, this book was a book about templates, and personally I have created and seen much better work than was featured here. This is the last book I buy from Mr. Green.
0	Waterlilies by Monet-Mini folding umbrella: Product not as pictured...This umbrella was pictured and displayed as having bold, dark, deep colors of blue and green but in reality the colors turned out to be pastels(light blue and green rather than dark colors as displayed) and therefore not as stunning...Disappointed.
0	Disappointing: I'd hoped I was investing in a useful book, esp. since one of the authors (Ismail) has coedited a book with Carver Mead. The material lacks conceptual clarity. It appears more like a compilation of material - a "cut and paste" effort by people who are strangers to analog circuits. I've met Terri Fiez at a conference - she was charming, but it was clear that she did not have a clean grasp of what she claimed was her area of expertise. Perhaps it was too much to expect Ismail to save this book ....
1	Perfect fit: I bought these shoes before and they served me well for over a year. They fit well and needs very little break in. Very comfortable.
0	Very disappointed: I was very disappointed with these shoes. This was the 3rd pair I order, 2 from another vendor and the last from Amazon. The first pair started to fall apart after several weeks. With the second pair, one of the shoes did not lay flat so it rocked when I stood in them. The last pair felt like it was a half size smaller than the other 2. It appears that quality control is lacking. Not what I expected for the price of these shoes.
1	Feels pretty good out of the box: I bought these shoes because I wanted a decent quality shoe, but I also didn't want to pay an enormous sum. I paid $109, whereas the shoes are listed at $175 in the J and M catalogue. I only have to wear this type of shoe once or twice a week. At the same time, I wanted something that would be suitable for meetings with lawyers and courtroom testimony.I've had them for a very short period of time, but I'm pleased with them. They came quickly and were consistent with the advertisements and information about them. Though they are pretty stiff out of the box, they are not uncomfortable, which is a pleasant surprise. And they look great!
1	Cannot go wrong with J&M: This is my second pair of Melton's. I have had the brown pair for10 years with upkeep and resole every few years. These shoes are very stiff when new, but as they brake-in become great support for feet. The 3E width is perfect for an XW foot.
0	horrific device!: i doubt this dictionary would have the word 'horrific'. wouldn't you think that the designer of a bookmark dictionary would realize that the market would be bookworms, that is, folks who have no need for every day words and a yen, an insatiable itch for that word just beyond reach? this was, therefore, one of the most frustrating purchases i have ever made, and i was frankly relieved when it failed to survive a rainstorm. by the by, one would also think that it would have survived a little rain. unless you have the vocabulary of an eight year old and the patience of a saint (and live in a desert) do not buy this product.
0	NOT a WEBKINZ: I am upset because I wanted to purchase a Webkinz unicorn and this came up as a webkinz brand because it is tagged as such with Amazon. It is not Webkinz! It is Russ brand. You can go online with this in a manner similar to Webkinz but only on the Russ website. Cute unicorn, but not the one that my daughter had requested. I have also had difficulty returning to Amazon because although they managed to send me this request for a review, they don't seem to be able to find a record of my purchase so I can return it. Sign me very disappointed in Amazon for this one!
0	Not vegetarian - contains gelatin: I searched for 'vegetarian candy' and this was one of the first results - gelatin is made from animal by-products.
1	Struck gold!: In search of the original gummi bear from my youth, I struck gold on Amazon. Not only was a wide variety of the product(in terms of quantity and packaging) available, but pricing was quite reasonable. The 5-ounce bags work great as stocking stuffers and ancillary birthday gifts.
0	Haribo: as a real german person ( and sorry for my englis, but i try my best ) i have to say these gummy bears taste not like the gummy bears back here in Germany. i come to the US twice a year and the one year i was a bit "homesick", so i bought a bag of my fave german gummy bears. what can i say, the taste was like the original but actually not, even the colors aren`t right. my american friend loves the gummy bears from Germany, so i carry every 6months 30bags into the US. if you love the american version, fine, but if you ever have the chance to get a bag from Germany, try the "original", much better.
0	Not fresh.: These bears were not fresh at all. They actually were melted all together when I got them. I contacted Amazon and they promptly took care of the problem. I do not recommend this product but highly recommend Amazon.
1	nice and sticky!!: First of all the color looks prettier in this picture. When it came it was indeed a beautiful, bright carribbean sea type blue, but with very little white washing through it (actually the reverse side--less sticky side--was prettier, ie more stripes...)so it would have been nicer had it been reversed. But it is still a pretty blue, although count on it being more solid blue than stripey like shown. I washed mine down with diluted dish soap on a rag and let it dry for an hour or so before using. I haven't worked up too much of a sweat on it yet but I did do challenging poses and experienced NO SLIPPING at all! So, overall the mat appears to be of good quality, grips the floor well--no sliding when I shift in poses, and my hands and feet didn't slip in any poses so far. I am going to keep up with the dish soap routine for a bit but it seems to be working out just fine for me! Would recommend it, don't stress over all the negative reviews, its a good price for a good mat :)
1	night reader: so far the booklight is great. it is my fourth one. the cables are very sensitive, but it is still the best reading light at night.
0	B is for...Blah?: This is the first Kinsey Millhone I've read, and given the success of the alphabet series it proved a great disappointment. A plot that is only mildly diverting, dialogue that is banal, narrative writing that is juvenile -- Example: Kinsey describing herself as "starving to death," by which she means...uh...hit by an attack of the munchies -- and imagery that is often pedestrian, sometimes obtuse, occasionally physically impossible. At one point Kinsey discusses the "concentric circles" she is making on a fine polished table with her cold drink. Nice image; nice, polysyllabic adjective, "concentric." Trouble is, unless the vessel containing the drink has a base that spontaneously contracts and expands, she couldn't make concentric circles with it. A single circle, sure; overlapping circles, maybe.A writer, then, in urgent need of a strong editor. Ah, but who dares second-guess a bestselling author?
1	Better than A: The second in Sue Grafton's alphabet series really helps the series pick up speed. This one takes Kinsey from California to Boca Raton Florida and back.
0	Nutranail Cuticle Remover: It doesn't seem to work well. I think it was a waste of one's money. I wouldn't purchase it again.
1	Great cuticle remover: Decided to start doing my own manicures/pedicures versus having them done at a salon. This cuticle remover works pretty well and makes my manicures and pedicures much easier; with better results. I presoak before applying which seems to do the trick
1	Halford is god!: I love this album for the pure power of the Metal God's voice. It was taken off the "Turbo Lover" tour, and the tracks "Rock you all around the World", and "Private Property" get the crowd riled up, and screaming the chorus back to Rob. But my absolute favorite Priest song is "Some Heads are Gonna Roll", and Halford screams the song out like no other. Only Bruce Dickenson can come close as far as screaming ability, and one only hopes that Halford and the boys patch things up, and give their fans a final world tour with the true Priest, and not "Steel Dragon". Rob Halford may be a bit strange, but as far as being a Metal singer, he is the very best out there, and to his hardcore fans he is was and will always be the true "Metal God".
1	Millions of people worldwide need Renewable Energy Products: Wind Energy Products are available for : lighting, water pumping, refrigerating, communication... This book is a necessary reading for all persons wishing to give the alternative energies a chance. Complete with many addresses and inside knowledge. A must for the alternative energy enthusiast...
1	Great Song: This contageous song can be played in my cd player all day. It has a punchy bass line, catchy organs, the sexy lyrics, and an alien sounding voice singing. Certainly a ground breaking song. I am disapointed in the sound of the remixes. I feel that they are stale. I love hearing them, because you can make out some of the voices more but over all i really dislike these remixes. For a ground breaking song, a ground breaking remix would have fit much better. These remixes sound very1993.I also wish the slightly altered in sound video version was on here.But get in your car and BLAST the Radio Edit out of your stereo and you will feel it pump through your veins.
1	Not much to say: Mechanix gloves are pretty much always a solid purchase. This is the third pair I've bought, and they've all been good quality, etc. They're not the most protective gloves in the world (for that, look for the impact-resistant version), but they're very good, and certainly help handle issues with heat, and lack of grip.
1	Works great as a soft play area!: I purchased this toy for my 9 month old son. We have hardwood floors throughout our house and it works great as a soft play area. Due to his age, I didn't expect him to play with it as a puzzle or understand the letters. He does chew on the various pieces. I have to watch to make sure he doesn't bite any pieces off but so far it hasn't been any issue. He likes to pull it apart but it's so easy to put back together...it usually only takes a few minutes. I think it's a great activity for him and a good introduction to letters and puzzles. I also have dogs and I love this playmat because it can easily be wiped down and cleaned. Overall, I am extremely satisfied with this product and would highly recommend it.
1	Nicely arranged compilation: This isn't a complete archive of their works. That would obviously be a boxed set. However, they have chosen a good collection of mixes here, mostly their own (hence indicated in another review that was unfortunately mostly negative). Chris Cox and Barry Harris like everyone else have gone through a subtle change of styles in the way they mix their different singles for artists. Their signature hard anthem sounds paved the way for their current trend towards power synths and hard tribal of today's singles like Thomas Newman's "Six Feet Under", which is just amazing (not included in this compilation, unfortunately). I've met both of these guys on separate occasions, just saw Barry again last week. As I am working on my own mixing at this point, it's nice to stay inspired by the talents of guys like this who have made today's sounds what they are -- and forging ahead the sound of dancefloor of the future. This enjoyable set is worth picking up.
0	slow program and 3d bugs make it practically unusable: This is a very frustrating product - it is good in that it has a lot of features, however the major features seem to have bugs that make them almost unusable. Doors and walls disappear in the 3D view unless you "nudge" them around so that the program redraws, and even then it doesn't always do it correctly. I have spent more time on this program trying to get it to do what I want it to do, and it is extremely aggravating.I am using Windows XP with a1.5Mhz Pentium IV processor and 512MB of RAM, so I don't think the speed problem is due to my computer, but just a problem inherent in the product. Viewing Punch's website support forum reveals frustrated users continually running against the limitations or outright flaws of the software.I don't know what other home design software to recommend, but not this one - there's just too many flaws for it to be worth the purchase price.
0	poor new design: I purchased this to replace our older one. We have the same mat but was stained from red sauce. This new mat has different suction cups that do not work. So it fails to stay put.
1	Nice, but only covers the divider: I was looking for a mat to go on both sides of the sink and also cover the middle. I did not know a mat was available for just the center, but that is exactly what this is.
1	Wonderful: I walked into a small CD/DVD outfit in NYC since they had a good collection of funk and jazz in the window. I find the most interesting collections of music at places such as this, and I was welcome by the sound of this CD playing. The lounge electronica mix of classic and modern made me buy it immediately. Without a doubt - a fabulous 'chill' cd.
1	Excellent resource: This book was an excellent resource for our two week vacation to Ecuador, including the Galapagos, in May of 2009. Lots of practical, helpful information.
1	Alchemy Live is one of the best live recordings ever: What can I say except Mark Knopfler is at his best on this video. I don't think you will see a range in guitar styles and techniques on any other recording that could match Alchemy Live. Sultans of Swing, Tunnel of Love & the Opus Telegraph Road are among some of the best songs on this video and in the music industry overall. And best of all his songs actually tell a story and have meaning unlike a lot (not all) of the mundane pop songs that we hear today.
0	Image quality much worse than VHS: I can't believe my eyes. Such an image should not be legal on a blu-ray. I don't think I have any VHS casette that is so bad. This Blu Ray only use is to listen to music with TV/projector turned off. I don't think it has more than 320 initial horizontal lines. What a shame !!!
0	What a disappointment after 666.: Having only heard 666, I thought that a "Complete Collection" would yield lost treasures. How sad to find that Aphrodite's Child's early recordings were so bad. This disk reminds me of a "worst of the 60's" collection. The only redeeming factor are the ten cuts from 666.
0	Kind of silly: While not utterly terrible, TE is a definate disappointment. The concept starts out as pretty cool but very quickly becomes borderline silly. The author struggles (unsucessefully) to find a meaningful story and the characters are flat and kind of juvenile (admittedly, they are young adults, but still...). One has to suspend a great deal of disbelief to stomach this book.I've never read Jack Williamson before and it is very unlikely that I ever will again.Not recommended.
0	Unreliable product and company: Bought this product as well as a Derale fan, both of which have disappointed. Controller was defective and have waited 2 weeks for replacement. Derale is 6 hrs away, should have had it after 2 days. Overall, I spent too much money for marginal products, subpar tech support and horrible customer service. Out of the over 5K of upgrades I put into my truck and the 20+ parts supplies and manufactures, this is the worst. There are other product on the market, I for one will be going to the tried and true mechanical fan.
1	Panasonic KX-FA132 cartridge for KX-F1000 series: Excellent service and delivery. I will order this item again from this seller through Amazon.com.
0	These are not phonics - there are only beginning letters, not the...: ou words, nor any of the others - ie silent 'b' in climb for example, none of the inside phonics that give children the most problems. Any idiot can learn the abc's that start words! These are very very basic and hardly complete!
0	no directions: bought this for hub for his ears. they tend to get wax build up. Rather than pay co-pays all of the time at the doctor,i bought this. The product didn't show up at first, i emailed the company and they sent another one. there are no directionson how to use it, hopefully we'll be able to figure it out when we need it
1	Good To Catch Up On The Seasons: This product is a great way to get the first five and a half season on DVD. The CD zipper case which holds all the seasons is a good idea but some of the DVD's can get scratched; mine fortunately did not though. The ping pong set and poker set are a cute idea but I don't really play the games. I think this product is a bit overpriced for what you get. If you don't plan on using the Ping pong set or the poker set I would say just buy the DVD's individually.
1	If you want to understand....: business statistics and at the same time learn how to use Excel statistical features, buy this book.Neufeld's emphasis is very much on using the power of Excel as a "tool" to convey an good understanding of the statistics. And having recently tried to brush up my Statistics using the traditional text book approach...So, if you're one of those who likes to really understand what's going on you'll like this book.
1	PANASONIC RP-SD064 SDMI Memory Card - Great for Price: Ordered this item for my digital camcorder and it is very nice as an added extra to save pictures to when not using the recorder. Very small and compact for easy storage
0	Not impressed: Not at all impressed with a carelessly put together book. Money is better spent elsewhere.
0	Very cheaply made. I would not recommend this.: This item looks great in the photo, but when it arrived it was so badly made that I sent it back immediately. The bottom plastic part that is supposed to screw into the glass wouldn't sit properly or screw in correctly, so the metal part of the bottom also sat crookedly.The "copper" outside parts were cheap as well and looked like they would discolor immediately out in the elements. I would not recommend this item to anyone.
0	Prone to rust: The beautiful copper finish lasted for a very short period of time. It was soon replaced by massive rust. It is difficult to clean and it also drips very easily. I would definitely not suggest this item.Again, copper plating prone to rust.
1	Sharp Corner Protection: I ordered this item after seeing a similar one at a friend's house. Since my daughter was just starting to pull herself up on our coffee table I thought we needed the protection for head bumps. Using customer comments as a guide I purchased a small bumper for our152" rectangular coffee table. It did not fit that shape. I wanted to exchange it for the medium size, but it arrived without a packing slip. By the time I received a copy nearly 25 days later it was to close to the 30 day return deadline and I was to tired from the hassle to exchange it, so I don't know how a size medium would have worked instead. I'm going to the fabric store to buy a leather needle and some sort of fabric to try to expand the bumper. The four stars are due to my liking the product, but feel some sort of dimensions are needed with the online description.
0	DO YOU LIKE NOT HAVING A CHOICE?: Do you like being physically dominated by a man? Do you like being bound & naked continuously? Do you like having no say so over your own body? Do you like having all decisions made for you without being asked? If your answer is YES, then buy this book. If your answer is NO then don't.
0	OBVIOUS DESIGN FLAW: I am currently writing this review with an ice pack on my ear because of the major hand tools it takes to put this earring in. The ball that clasps on to the bottom of the earring is IMPOSSIBLE to put in when the earring is in your ear. I learned an important lesson today and will not be purchasing any product with this design again.
1	Another great tale of crime in Southie: Great story that is easy to read about crime and corruption in South Boston. One criminal's take on his life and experiences. possible elaboration, but nothing seemed glorified.
1	Enjoyable read with great characters: Peter was written at the forefront of the first novels featuring gay themes in positive ways. It has touching characterizations, people to pull for, and an ending that leaves you wanting more. What more could you want? Exotic locale? Its set in Australia and that comes through in the language and attitudes and is refreshing. It sets just the right tone for a15 year old out to find his way. I enjoy the respectful way that the character David is handled as well, as a good person instead of the way many authors would have went just for shock value.
1	This pad does its job well at a lower cost than others.: Okay - its a pad - not much to say about it; however, it is functional and inexpensive. We have had it for 9 months now and nothing has gotten through. That is most likely due to the fact that our daughter only had one accident - but it worked. That's what matters right! Buy 2 of these - keeping one ready for that inevetible for the middle-of-the-night emergency.
0	It really really doesn't fit!: Ok, I just got done wrestling with this pad....I had high hopes and thought I would try it regardless of the reviews...IT REALLY DOESN'T FIT. I mean off by a long shot and I cannot even imagine the fit after it was washed. There are way too many pads to choose from to waste time, money and wrestling moves trying this one out.
1	Love this!!!: I love this underwater camera case!!Three years ago I did some snorkeling in Hawaii and tried to take photos with those crappy disposable cameras. Out of two cameras, i had maybe 3 pictures come out.Last year I was on a cruise in the Caribbean and did more snorkeling only this time I had this housing for my digital camera. I got DOZENS of photos that just came out beautiful!!!I will never use one of those awful disposable underwater cameras ever again.
0	Don't support this photographer: Jim Cole has been ticketed and banned at many National Parks for willing breaking the law and endangering, not only his life, but the lives of the bears. He was recently mauled at Yellowstone and his actions most likely will result in the death of the bear as he pursued and harrassed a mother bear protecting her cubs. We were at Yellowstone during the incident and the rangers said that the photos they found in his camera did not line up with the tale he told.This is his second mauling because he will risk the life of the bear just to get his money shot. If you are considering buying his books because you love bears, be aware that he is not an advocate for bears but rather will do things that result in their being shot in order to enrich himself.
1	Powerful tool!: A powerful tool! I like it very much! As compare to Swiss Army Knife, the blade of Leatherman is more sharp and workable. The shear is somehow small, but it is not my main focus.
1	An A for A&R: I've known Biill Flanagan over the years as a fellow traveler in music (we've written for a lot of the same magazines -- Musician, Rolling Stone, The NY Times, et al). I've always found him to be perceptive and clear-eyed about the music business while remaining a devoted fan of music, rarely cynical and unusually supportive, and those qualities serve him well in this novel. He's an engaging storyteller, and packs enough real adventure into the work--squalls at sea, a kidnapping, some street fights--to make me think that he could turn out some fine novels that have nothing to do with the music industry. But here he has great fun skewering the pretensions of the business while maintaining a genuine affection for his characters. Well done.
1	Great designs for quaint, cute, unique and quick cross stitching: This book is well divided into categories and includes theme favorites, such as Christmas, holidays, flowers, hearts, alphabets, etc. The book also includes unique & fun designs within those and other categories: castles, dragons, carousel horses, frogs, Uncle Sam, state flowers, etc. Full color photographs of the finished designs precede by a page the full color design instructions. The designs can be used for small projects (bookmarks, jar toppers, etc.) or they can be combined to create larger projects.
0	You get what you pay for ... cheap: I wouldn't recommend this product, just take a look at the price. Do you want to trust a cheap charger with your $300 MP3 player? I went to a more well know manufacture and bought a charger from them. Search Gomadic they are a more well known brand in Amazon and you will see better choices for example:Rapid Car / Auto Travel Charger w/ Tip Exchange for the Apple iPod Video (60GB) - Gomadic Brand
0	wish i got the item: I have contacted amazon and the seller about not recieving the charger with the wall charge but no one cares amazon say contact buyer buyer says contact AMAZON and over 2 months have gone buy and no one has helped me and fixing the problem I will never buy from AMAZON AGAIN!!!!!!!!
0	Por favor, ahorreselo: El dvd es muy malo tecnicamente, pusieron los canales al reves. Escuchara al publico adelante y el concierto atras. Ademas no es tan bueno como los videos Arriesgare la piel(Emi-Chile) y The best of (CGD-Warner).BAd, bery bad.
1	good watch: As the last reviewer noted, there are some political undertones here. However, a 2 star rating is unfair. This video is a decent introduction to the Cuban environment and is worth the watch.
1	Great CD!!!!: Love all the tracks, very happy and upbeat music. Also, I like the fact that they donate One-third of the artist royalties from the CD's sales to 'CARE' to help feed the hungry children throughout the world.
1	One of my favorite books and a new favorite author: I love this novel. Read it! I discovered it by accident in a supermarket a few years ago and haven't forgotten it. Elizabeth Hand is a dazzling writer of unique vision, who transcends limitations of genre through her virtuosity with language. "Waking the Moon" remains my favorite of the Hand books that I've read. I eagerly await her next one.
0	Pretentious and silly: This is a book for sensitive college girls who see faces in the moon. For the rest of us, though, this book is ridiculous. The use of mythology is interesting, but degenerates into laugh out loud scenes of bare-breasted women chanting and summoning snakes. Furthermore, Washington is a poor choice for a setting, since it is NOT an old city, even by North American standards.
1	Perfect fit: My husband made a cradle for our son and when it came time to buy a sheet that fit it wasn't an easy task. I tried several stores in the area and I wasn't able to find one. Once I received the Koala Baby cradle sheet I was a little reluctant about whether or not it would fit. However, once I put it on the mattress, not only did it fit perfectly it was also very soft.
0	Doesn't work with Toshiba Tecra A4 notebood: Same problem as reviewer B Chan - I have the USB wireless model, not bluetooth, but no response to extra programmable buttons on a Toshiba Tecra A4.Toshiba owners beware!!
0	For Toshiba Notebooks - Test Before u Buy: Good build, feels comfortable and smooth wheel; no clicks - preference thing :)However not ideal for road warriors:1. No on/off switch..2. Dunno about other notebooks, but on a Tecra A4, P750, XP, SP2 with bulit in bluetooth (BT), BT security setting needs to be set to "low" (no security provided by bluetooth) before the mouse is recognized; in addition, if the setting is set to any level higher, the mouse will not be recognized again after a reboot. NOT SAFE!In addition even after installation of IP 5.2 software: side scroll wheel and page up/down buttons don't work (maybe conflict with notebook touchpad)It would be good to hear from other Tosh users out there. I am however returning the product.
0	JVC Everio GZMG57 DIGITEL MEDIA CAMCORDER: With the camera recording and I turn my body I get a jerking motion on the play back. The biggest complaint I have is the lack of instructions that can be understood on how to do THINGS. Yes, I see a phone number. I can call and I have done this. When you get someone to help you which might be a long wait. They are very polite and explain so I can understand. Why can't they write instructions that can be understood in the first place. JVC is not alone on this subject
0	Does More Harm Than Good: A poorly documented book that slams people, is filled with judgment, and does nothing to help others is the foundation of the entire book. Salerno's SHAM does not take into account the millions of people that ARE actually being helped. The book is filled with inconsistancy, poorly argued statements, and is an attack on celebrity, so that he, through this book, can cash in on the celebrity bashing.The whole book is filled with negative gossip, that while reading it, I wondered why I felt so bad? This book did nothing to help me, if anything, it made me feel worse.
0	Terribly out of tune: I am a professional musician, so I might be overly sensitive to these things, but this keyboard is completely out of tune. I don't mean "it's not tuned exactly to A 440 concert pitch" I mean the notes are not in tune with each other. If you follow the "sheet music" included in this you get a minor rather than a major "Row, row, row your boat" and a "Twinkle Twinkle" with a minor sixth instead of a major one. It's nice that they attempt to have a complete octave, but if all you have are eight notes they'd better be the eight notes of the major scale!Not usable in my opinion.I can't speak to the durability or other usability issues mentioned in other reviews because we didn't even take it out of the box and are sending it back.
1	Works great and very durable: This bracket is very strong.I use it every day at work with a15 inch point of sale system that's about 40+lbs.Very sturdy and easy to adjust.It can be attached to just one stud.
1	Great Book: This is one of the best books I have ever read on Tibetan culture and religion. It is clear and concise. It is extremely informative, revealing practices that have been kept secret, for some unknown reason, for centuries. A great book!
0	Not as I thought it would be.: I ordered this book for my grandchildren. The age it is stated to be intended for is not appropriate. The words are confusing and way above the learning stage of the intended age group.
1	AUSSIE THUMBS UP FROM COUNTRY MUSIC LOVER: A texan friend told me of these guys and I think they are fantastic. It's like true country meets heavy rock. They write about real issues and keep in down to earth. I'll be buying their other CD's for sure and telling all my Aussie friends about them. These guys are what country music is all about!!
1	Good music: Progessive country with a flare of rock. Each song is enjoyable to listen to. I would recommend this album as a good buy,
0	Not for home studios, not worth $100: I am planning a home studio approx.12X15 (180sf) in space. This book on building a ceramic studio is a lovely overview and picture book of several professional studios in southern climes, which I am not in and ranged size from 375sf to 5,000sf. Also, it was advertised on Amazon.com as retailing for $144.67, but I bought a used copy for $29.00 and feeling pretty good about the savings. It is printed right on the interior of the book jacket that the publisher's retail price is $24.95.This is not a critique of the contents of the book. But when I thought it was a $100 value, I assumed I was getting THE bible of home studios. Instead: the pictures were lovely, the info for professional artists planning a studio and showroom are probably good, but anyone at that level of the craft probably already knew alot of the info. And it was definitely not worth more than the original retail. Not too relevant for a home potter in New England.
0	blah.: It isn't as good as The Twilight Zone. very outdated. very corny. The hour long format is boring. I do not recommend this product to anyone.
0	Cheaply made DVDs or what?: I sent the first DVD back because it kept stopping in the middle of scenes and getting stuck. After receiving the replacement DVD, it worked fine but then started doing the same thing. I think when mass duplicating these DVDs they must write them at very high speeds which may corrupt a few, or many for that fact. I've tried it in other DVD players and it does the same thing. My other DVDs work just fine. I think these must have been cheaply made (probably in Mexico like the Brady Bunch DVDs). I will not buy any more Outer Limits DVDs. Very disappointed.
1	Barefoot in the Park: Very well written.Superb for community theatre productions.Has all the characters that makes for a good tryout and production.This should be on the list for any community theatre.
1	Christopher Walken is classic!: Light farce. Fun. Cast is terrific. No more to say but nine more words are required. So see it. Done
1	Good For Kids: I think that Barney the purple dinosaur is a good role model for children12-24 months.He teaches kids about hygiene, and how to treat each-other,etc.
0	Not for me.: Barney's Chirstmas Star is one of the most boring movies I'veever watched.I had to watch it with my child and I could notsit through it. I know Barney is a very good movie/show foryoung children and is very educational,but I'm not going to watchit again.
0	You get what you pay for: I bought 2 of them for my Mac Minis: one for home and one for work. Unfortunately, the scroll down button broke 4 months later on both mice. I take great care of my belongings and keep my computer equipment clean and in a dust-free environment. Macally products are usually great and the mouse itself is fine if it wasn't for this glitch.
1	Aura Spa Lavendar Shampoo: This is an excellent product. It is the only one that works with my hair and unfortunately, I can only find it online anymore. I have waist length hair and all I need is a dime-sized amount of this shampoo. It lathers wonderfully and leaves my hair in great shape, and it smells great too!
0	romantic sound: This has a "romantic sound" and I was looking for something more relaxing. If your looking for something more relaxing, I'd recommend "Passages" by Mike Wall.
1	Glad to go lighter!: We recently purchased this product to replace a heavier, bulkier wheelchair we had been using for general transport. It has been a backsaver for me...it is lighter all around (from lifting it in/out of the car to pushing my 200+lb husband) plus it stores in smaller places than our previous one.I'm not sure why I waited so long to replace our other one!TIP: BE SURE to put those brakes on the back wheels before loading your rider...it does have a tendency to tip back if you don't.
0	Returned Item: This product had to be returned because it did not fit nor did it solve the problem for which it was ordered. The company was honest and credited our account. I would deal with them again.
1	Hey, it's still George Jones: This modestly-programmed collection is a good overview of his final work for the MCA label from1991-98. The disc opens with Jones struggling to feign interest in the rock-oriented "young country" sound; the problem was with the formula, not with his singing, which remains great to this day. There are some notable songs, such as "Wrong Is What I Do Best," but where things really started to click is on "High-Tech Redneck" and "Walls Can Fall," songs that marked the start of a commercial and creative renaissance that finally got George engaged on an emotional level again. This may be about as much of his music from the period as most folks would need, although diehard fans will also want to track down the original albums.
0	Premium Price - Poor Craftsmanship: Wherein this was a quality filter for my Nikon18-200 lens, after two weeks, the glass fell out of the rim. Just fell out while changing filters. What was an important component to my photography, and camera protection, is now an expensive piece of trash. As a replacement, I went with a different brand. I guess when the packaging says, "professional filter series," it means that "professionals" have enough money to purchase replacements when their equipment goes prematurely south. I can only hope my filter was a fluke and Quantaray does not have serious quality control issues. But like I said, it was a nice filter when it was in one piece.
1	Good. As described: I bought it because the great reviews from other user. I brought it to a trip to Mali, nothing went wrong, views are good. Satisfied with what I got.
1	Excellent buy for the money: This is a very nice little,lightweight binocular. It draws in things crisp and clear. It's perfect for sporting events, travel, and musicals. I have a more expensive, heavier pair, but I always grab this one since its light and easily fits in a coat pocket. I originally bought one for my daughter to take to high school football games, but when I saw and tried it out, I bought myself one. It has separate adjustments for each eye if you need it.
0	really pathetic: WHY OH WHY do we make romantic images out of what the ancient egyptians actually accomplished? Grossly and highly exagerated claims about them are taught as FACT in area schools and Mr. Poe seems to be adding fuel to this fire. We leave in a society that takes the word of journalists and actors over people trained in their respective fields. it truly is pathetic. we need to stop believing that the ancient Egyptians speak with this magical voice that we have forgotten. Because as far as hard evidence can tell us, they didn't. I mean, in 6,000 years they couldn't figure out the importance of the brain!!!They picked it out through the nose when you were embalmed because they didn't feel it was worth anything. For the record, I'm from Memphis Egypt and I have blue eyes.
1	egyptians: I read this book and it is really interesting.If egyptian aren't black then why does egyptian presedent Anwar Sudat looks african. People sometime mistake me for egyptian but i'm black and dark. beacause all black people don't have wooly hair or real dark skin. so egyptians had to be black. think about it?
0	Complete hogwash: Throughout history Blacks have served only two purposes: slave labor and amusing others. This book falls in the latter category.
0	These are not worth even one star!: These are not like the ones we use to buy. They are thin and flimsy. I had to scrunch it up and put a rubber band around it to even get it to be of any use. I will try to put two of them together to have a least one that is halfway useful. If I were SOS I would be ashamed to put my name on them. The old ones were so good and these are total crap!!!!! I would not advise anyone to buy them. the worst part is I bought a pack of 24.
1	Tuffy Dishwashing Pad: I find that these are the best scrubbers for most kitchen clean-up. Unlike regular S.O.S. pads these are made of plastic and do not scratch pans. I was unable to find them in stores so I got them from Amazon. Great little product. My only criticism is that you have to be a bit careful so they don't unravel. They last a long time and are simple to clean in the dishwasher, if necessary.
0	Returned due to terrible quality: Like some of the other recent reviews, the quality of these blue scrubbies is terrible. I returned this item to Amazon as they are virtually unusable. I can't imagine these would last through more than one or two dish washes. Purchase them if you don't believe it or think that we are being overly critical (which is what I thought prior to ordering)... but be prepared to return them once you see for yourself. They may look like what you expect them to based on the pictures, but the reality is that they are not up to any reasonable standards for this type of product.
0	Don't Buy These: I tried to order the original red and yellow Tuffies, but they're out, maybe permanently. These blue ones are bogus; they are flimsy. You may as well buy whatever scrubbers they're selling at the grocery. Another fine product bites the dust.
0	New Blue Tuffy much lower quality: Beware the new blue Tuffys. I just tried to buy the usual red and yellow Tuffy and all they had was this new blue one. I could tell as soon as I picked it up off the shelf that it was a crappy, cheap version of what used to be a decent product. I have gone out of my way to pay more money for the yellow and red Tuffy's because the cheaper copies just didn't last as long, or feel as good in my hand.The manufacturer is insulting me by thinking that I won't notice the much lesser quality of this blue Tuffy. It is thinner and losely connected. I expect it to fall apart very quickly.
1	The Art of Writing Essays: As he is often wont, Wendell Berry speaks to both young and old in this excellent collection of essays in which he wrestles with some of the most important questions American citizens ought to be pondering today. The opening essay, "A Citizen's Response," sets the very constructive tone of the entire collection--a collection which ends with a theme familiar to those who frequent Berry's ideas: "Is Life a Miracle."
1	A must read!: It is difficult to write a review for a book that is so well written, so unbelievably relevant and important, that makes you feel humble as you try to form a clear concise sentence the way only Wendell Berry can. He is our modern day Mark Twain! Thank you, Mr. Berry, for saying what needs to be said!
0	Picture is deceiving: Do not buy this product if you think you are getting a pad that looks like the picture. It has a completely different look to it than whats in the picture. Charcoal Gray??? Ha!!!! more like Disco Silver!!!!!!
1	gimme more: sour s'ghetti will keep you wanting more. before you know it, you will have finished your bag and be craving another handful of yummy gummies. def worth to order multiple bags.
1	short, but beautifull: No voice on this album, just his great piano playing, and some additional whisteling. The album is hauntingly beautifull, but terribly short - it only lasts about 20 minutes. It's a kind of Brad Mehldau meets minimalism album; it might sound very simplistic, it still is beautifull enough to blow you away. If it would be a bit longer, it would be a five star album for sure.
0	Absolutely horrible quality: I understand that alot of people love Michael Jackson including myself. That is why I was suckered into buying this DVD. I usually do not return items but I just had to do it. This is SUCH a waste of money. No matter how desperate you may be to add unseen footage of MJ to your collection do not buy this. It's nothing new. Also, it is the worst quality product I have ever bought in my entire life. I understand that people want to jump on the bandwagon and try to make a quick buck off of MJ fans like me but this is just ridiculous. Have you no shame win productions. Seriously.
0	desilusionado: la verdad pense encontrarme con mejor imagen de la que vi tanto en la primera como en la segunda parte... parece que lo hubieran bajado de internet y tiene muy mala calidad para el precio que tiene.
0	Disapointed fit and finish: First of all, this item is shipped as freight, so delivery is not via the UPS guy like most of my Amazon products.Secondly, some of the pieces were labled wrong. The seat had a sticker on it (Back) that was clearly in the front by the illustration--and the only way it would fit together. The major assembly is by Tenon and dowels, which is fine, but impossible to take apart to replace or re-asseble (see next point).Finally, one of the pre-assembled joints was poor and I had to use glue to keep it together. All-in all, I don't recommend this product.
1	Please don't believe the previous reviewer...: I felt I should make a contribution in order to up the average rating of this record. This record is absolutely sublime, transcendently cool, jazz-inflected house, perfectly mixed and produced with amazing subtlety, and basically all-round wonderful. Please don't believe the last reviewer: he or she has been listening to too many Prodigy records.
0	CO2 tank empty, and crappy mask: Really good marker but the CO2 tank was empty and the hopper is cracked and the mask is a throwaway. Should'nt show things you are going to send bad or wrong.
0	Kipper-Let it Snow: this was the cheapest VHS I've ever ordered. First..it took MONTHS to come and then it was as if EACH story was spliced unto a blank tape. EACH story had the ENDING credits and then it started the next story. It was ONLY 30 minutes long. I saw this SAME tape at [a store] and it was 60 MINUTES long. Bad, bad taping...could have done it myself
1	Kitchen Aid Slow Cooker: Great product with wonderful controls. My old slow cooker kept cooking the food even though it was supposed to be on warm only! My only 'complaint' is that I wish it were a little smaller in size. 7 quarts is VERY large. Great for soups but too big for many things I want to do and it simply takes up alot of storage space in my kitchen
0	So disappointed with KitchenAid: Purchased slow cooker through Amazon.com on November10.1st crock was chipped, used it anyway and found it leaked also (crack I couldn't see).Amazon quickly sent replacement. 2nd crock is warped and lid (1st or 2nd) does not fit properly - major gap.Ordered a replacement again ... response from Amazon"As it seems that the problem with this item is more widespread than we originally thought, we are unable to send another replacement.We will investigate and remedy the situation with the item; however, I cannot guarantee when the error may be fixed."We are SOOOOO disappointed with KitchenAid. (Amazon has been VERY responsive, as always!)
1	excellent product: I don't know of any other slow cooker on the market (with the exception of maybe the AllClad) that has as much temperature and timing flexibility (10 hours with an extra 4 of warming time), with simple styling that would fit in with any kitchen. With the 7 quart capacity, whole chickens and a whole lot of ribs fit nicely. I have not found 7 quart liner bags of yet, but you can work with the 6.5 ones. It's solidly constructed, as opposed to some of the cheaper brands, and it works wonderfully.
0	Wrong item sent: As described, I ordered a "hand winch with cable", however; upon arrival I received a hand winch with a strap (not a cable which is needed for my pulley system) which does not or will not meet my needs. When I complained to the shipper there was no response. Since it cost too much to return I just threw it on the shelf with the other junk.
1	Great price: For the price, it is great. The latch is a little "iffy", but it's fine for my uses. Don't think I would trust it with1200 lbs, though.
0	Thought I would save money: I bought this to save money on batteries, only it doesnt work all the time, so I ended up having use batteries anyway now.
0	NOT for Model PT-550: Advertising needs clarification: I've searched high and low for a few years now for a power adapter for the P-Touch PT-550. The advertisement led me to believe this might finally work. It doesn't. The PT-550 takes a 9.5 volt adapter, and it's VERY finicky about any variations in voltage. 9.0 won't work, nor will anything above 9.5.No variable voltage wall wort I've found will put out a 9.5 volt AC either. The PT-550 sucks batteries quickly. If you're going to get an older model P-Touch, stay far away from the 550 (although it functions well other than the power issues), and DON'T buy this power adapter for your existing 550.
1	Superb: I rarely review items for Amazon, prefering to leave that to others. This production is, however, of such high quality I feel it deserves all the recognition it can get.Staging is sparse, but appropriate and meaningful to the flow of the story line. Costumes are not necessarily modern, but certainly not 'period correct'. They are very striking though, and lend brilliance to the effect.The singing is spectacular from all the characters.Musical direction is first rate. Most of all, the sound and picture quality in Bluray is magnificent.This is , for my money, the best available version of 'Lohingrin" available. Wagner's work is allowed to speak for itself, without imposition of any outside agendas. Highly recommended.
1	Wonderful gift for dog-lovers: I got this as a gift for a friend who loves dogs and they thought it was wonderful! It's got tons of gorgeous pictures - even if you are not necessarily a dog person you will enjoy the skill it took to create such beautiful images.
0	Poor quality - poor customer service: I purchased this battery for my Dell computer. It failed within a few months and they sent me a replacement (after numerous efforts to reach them went unanswered). That battery failed within a few weeks. They promised a refund when we sent that one back but instead they sent another battery! That one also failed immediately. We sent that one back and they claimed they never received it. So, they refused to refund, replace or give us any credit for the purchase. I paid them $80 dollars for a battery I don't have after 3 of theirs failed. I paid for return shipping, so I lost more than the original cost. My repeated efforts to get the owner to contact me were ignored and refused. Poor quality and horrible customer service.
0	Breaks Easily: I bought two of these for my Dad (one for the walker and one for the wheelchair). It didn't fit on his first walker (very basic hospital type walker). The frame was too small for the cup alone, and too big to use the adapter. He later got a HUGO walker and it did fit that one fine. The down side is that it breaks very easily! I am frequently lifting my Dad's walker and putting it in the trunk of the car, and it is very easy to break the plastic drink cup holder. (The second drink cup holder got broken when we checked the walker with the airline, and I suppose I should have seen that one coming). Otherwise, they worked fine for the short time we had them.
0	Similar to Hinge Factor: Fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me. I purchased the Hinge Factor, this author's previous attempt to explain the outcome of events on external factors, and found it to be both poorly written and historically inaccurate. It was a badly executed work, although it was an interesting concept. Notwithstanding this, I ended up buying this book to see if, perhaps, better editing had resulted in a better product.Sadly, the answer is no. This book is, once again, contains numerous writing errors (it is quite clear that this author's primary language in not English, and either this is a bad translation, or was not subject to proper editing) and confusing fact and fiction. Another failed effort. Perhaps not as disappointing as the Hinge Factor, but still really not worth ones time and effort. Sorry.
1	Wonderful book: This book was such a great help to my husband and me. We didn't completely realize what we were doing to hurt each other - or maybe we did, but it became so habitual that neither of us knew how to break it. This book helped so much in teaching each of us what our weaknesses were and what to do to improve them.I saw some of the reviews saying the book only had very obvious advice. Most of it IS obvious, like don't be disrespectful and show anger. I knew that, of course, but the problem was, it was a habit. We didn't know HOW to overcome it. That is how the book helped us most. Teaching us how to communicate in ways that are not hurtful. I highly recommend it for anyone in a bad marriage.I do not know if it would be very helpful for couples who already have a good marriage but are looking to improve. I feel like this book is aimed toward couples who are REALLY struggling. It's worth a look though, if you're not sure, check it out at the library and see what you think.
1	I love the Jefferson's: The Jefferson's First Season is great and Funny but you really have to watched the All in the family because is the spend off of it
1	It gets no better then this!: I had no idea this was a spinoff from all in the family until i picked up, AITF! This shows the bomb! Bomb as in good. It's all new to me, i was a baby in early 80's!! This shows very funny. Moving on up yall!! I like George though, he got major swag! Enjoy this, because i am.
1	I am beginning to get worried weather Jeffersons season 5 will be released. someone please help: I am getting worried about weather The Jeffersons the complete Fifth Season is going to be released anytime soon. I guess it will be another long awaited release. someone please help with any information. thanks. anyway, The Jeffersons first season is excellently funny.
1	Todd, no sensitive love songs...: This is a great record, especially the songs "Just in Case" (decidedly not a sensitive love song), 'Happy to be Here" and especially "D.B. Cooper". The use of a horn section in the arrangements of some of the songs is quite clever and makes me chuckle -- something that I look for in a Todd Snider recording. He continues to be one of our best troubadours in the Woody Guthrie sense of the term. Well worth getting.
0	A Master of Inclusion and Exclusion: Irving took me in once. I gave GORING a good review on the face of what seemed to be in depth research, and overlooked that which was left unsaid. Having now read GOEBBELS, I understand his methodology. He includes enough to reel in the unwary, but leaves out or glosses over that information which would indict the guilty. This book is a perfect example of that technique. Irving uses it, as he did GORING, to infer that Hitler, and most of the German military and civilian population, just weren't aware of the atrocities at the concentration camps.Shame on you, David Irving!
0	its fiction, not history: Unfortunately, this interesting bit of history relies on fictional details to support its larger claims. There is documentation about the falsities in this volume that came to light at David Irvings libel trial in London that removes any value to this book other than the interesting and fascinating way that Mr. Irving is able to weave his stories. If you like other WWII fiction you might enjoy this. If you are looking for REAL history then you are better off reading Goebbels diary entries in their original German than relying on David Irvings misguided attempt to channel the Third Reichs thinkers in this book.
0	Not a very good idea Paul: I grew up listening to the Beatles and older country. I have a lot of respect for the oldies but goodies because if it was not for them, we would not have rock and roll today. But when I heard the samples for this album, I couldn't believe my ears. I feel Swing should stay where it is. Do not take Rock Songs(current ones-within the last 20 yrs) and turn them into swing. It doesn't sound right. There are plenty of songs from that era that sound great to swing. Like New York, New York by Frank Sinatra. I listen to all kinds of music...it just depends on my mood. But this is only my opinion.
0	Great - when it works.: This was actually my second iRobot Roomba. The first one, the basic red model, just started stopping and starting and only going in small circles and shutting off, after we had only had it for about one-and-a-half months, just after the "return" date, of course. We bought it at Circuit City, who claims they fix all the products, but found out everything BUT Roomba products,which should have been my first clue. I ordered this one from Amazon, hoping I had just gotten a lemon. Once again, after about one-and-a-half months, it began appearing to charge; but after I turned it on, charge light would go back to red, like it hadn't been charged. I'm hoping Amazon will treat their customers better than Circuit City and either repair or refund. Not buying another Roomba though! Hoping the Sharper Image one is better. We have mostly hardwood floors too, so not like it was a difficult job.
0	Just not worth it: We've had ours for over a year. At first I thought it was going to be very useful, but it has turned out to be more of a frustration than a useful device. It does very poorly on carpeted areas, and the front wheel gets bogged down with pet hair very quickly on any type of surface. You can't clean the front wheel as it doesn't detach, so your only option is to use a pair of tweezers on it. I found myself spending more time on cleaning the Roomba than using it. We quickly stopped using it for cleaning rooms and just use it for cleaning under the bed, where our vacuum will not fit. Today, it has decided to stop working after a few seconds of use, so I'm guessing it is the battery, although it shows having a full charge. Good luck in trying to get their Tech support to assist either on the phone or via email.
1	Wonderful: I throughly enjoyed reading "Time Will Tell". Friendship is something we seem to forget about once we 'grow-up', graduate from highschool and/or college, get married, etc. Sina, Rachel, and Hope had a lock on their friendship no key could unlatch. Over a ten year time span, no matter what obstacles were thrown their way, their friendship was able to endure it all. It makes me look back on my friends and how time and other obligations have pushed us apart. Throughout the story, their strong belief in God was often mentioned which made the story more authentic. There are certain events that took place at the end of the story that makes me anxiously await a sequel. Keep on writing Trevy!
1	Very nice!: Bake cookies, biscuits... whatever, and the cookie pan cleans up easily. It's a nice size - not too large or small.
0	Loss of sustain: No signal interruptions (which is a good thing), but there is A LOT of an annoying loss of sustain. I play mainly classic hard rock songs and I really felt a lack of a more consistent sound. I'll try to compensate it with a compressor pedal before the pedalboard, but I dont know if it will be effective. If it don't works, I'll try to sell the product (warning about the sustain issue, surely).Don't ask me why, but when I was looking for reviews in order to decide what wireless system to buy, i found very good ones for this product. But just when I got and tested it, I returned to google adding the word SUSTAIN to the search and finally found a lot of bad reviews, all them reporting this terrible issue.So, here's another bad review :/
1	5 piece oak dining set: Itg makes a nice set once you put it together. The instructions leave it up to the customer to figure out how to get the chair slats into the holes in the seat. You have to twist them into the holes which requires some force. That was the hardest part of the whole operation. The rest was easy.
0	SCAM DVD!!! DO NOT BUY!!!: So I bought this DVD with the idea that it would be like other orchestral videos where cameras pan the orchestra, conductor, etc... NOT SO - this is a total scam DVD - basically no different than a CD. Each movement track has a boring still picture that lasts the entire movement without change - and to top it off it's a very unimaginative performance... Of course because I have opened it I am probably not allowed to return it either - if that is the case, thank God I'm only out about $12... Unfortunately at this time there does not seem to exist a DVD of an orchestra playing the famous music of Ferde Grofe. I have a feeling that the other Naxos DVD's are made in this way too - be careful before buying a DVD from Naxos - they need to advertise much clearer. A fine recording of this work can be found in the CBS Masterworks CD recording with Leonard Bernstein and the New York Phil.
1	best gummi peaches ever: i love candy, and i love haribo, these gummi peaches give me a sense of nostalgia and are easily my favorite...i highly recommend these...
1	Decca "Not-As-Legendary" as...: Kertesz's Requiem doesn't have the magic and magisterial qualities as the Ancerl version on DG does but nevertheless it is a very good performace. Kertesz plays it balanced, but not as vigorously and energetically as Ancerl does. The Decca sound is demonstration quality as the DG is.It's true though that Kertesz was totally in tune with the world of Dvorak, as his excellent Symphony cycle shows...but still, Ancerl reins when it comes to the Requiem!
1	One of my favorite movies: So glad I could find it in DVD. Perfect condition. Love the extras. What can you say about a perfect product, great seller, super fast seller, great price. All good. No that's wrong..........GREAT everything!!!!
1	Love It1: I just love Valerie Bertinelli. This movie is a must see. A fun romantic family movie, you will enjoy it.
0	Bad purchase: We purchased this inflatable mattress in March 2011 and used it for one visit from the grandkids (4 nights) in April. In August we got it out again and our grandson woke up on a flat floor. The mattress had deflated. We tried again; same ending.We have tried to find the leak using water, soapy water - doing everything the Intex site said to try. We finally ordered a new valve so the mattress would work for the next visit. It deflated again even with the new valve. We are very unhappy with this purchase.
1	Quality product: I use this mattress for camping. For the price, it can not be beat. I am 215 lbs and I lost no air in the mattress for the first two days, then just a little on day three. I would have no hesitation buying this over its competitors.
0	I took my chances...: I had pretty low expectations and I wasn't dissappointed. It never inflated all of the way for reasons I couldn't fiqure out. The pump that comes with it has such a low pressure of air coming out I felt like I could have blown it up faster. I laid around on it for an evening and it was okay, though I was afraid to move to much for fear of it would just collapse under my weight (which is just118). I actually purchased it for overnight guests on Xmas but suspect that after a 250lb man spends the night on it, it won't last very long. But in the products' defense I got what I paid for and I knew that going in.
1	Perfect for what we need: We ordered two of these airbeds. I gave it four stars because the second one had a leak, which we didn't discover until my daughter slept directly on the floor! I returned it (very easy process) and received a replacement very quickly (no leaks!). Easy to inflate and deflate, I think this product is well worth the money!
0	Leaked air-- was unuseable: I pumped this mattress up and it leaked a considerable amount of air within1 hour, I also have a Coleman mattress and it holds air and is a lot thicker construction. Don't buy this one.
0	Battery-powered pump doesn't work.: I see a couple of bad reviews about this product, but I find it fascinating that no one has complained about the fact that the battery-powered air pump is complete trash. It is as if I bought a toy version of it. I admit that the mattress looks really nice, and probably feels good to sleep on AFTER it is fully inflated, but what freaking good is it if the pump doesn't work? To make matters worse, I tried putting the damned thing back inside the box to return it, but the damned thing doesn't even fit back inside! By the time it is inside the box, there is no room to put the pump, and the box looks like it is about to explode.IMO, (even if for a measly $20), this product is NOT worth getting.
1	Sony Skymap 2000: Great product. I mounted the antenna in every place possible in my Tahoe and it worked no matter where it was located. Great user freindly software gives you real time accident reporting (Depending on your location). I would recommend this hardware software combination to anyone who wants a GPS solution for their car.
0	Hope you own a battery store: This is a really nice radio, But, It eats batterys and there is no recharger for it. Stay away from this unit unless it is going to sit and never get used.
1	Good value: Range is as stated on open land but batteries do tend to lose a lot of power quickly. A handy little unit.
0	I paid but never received this item -- BEWARE!!!!: I placed my order on March 7 and I am still waiting for it to arrive.
0	don't waste your money: Do not waste your money buying this item. I tested it on various glass surfaces and it did not perform well, it didn't even puncture skin.
1	Great invention: So much better than trying to find that hammer version. It's a glass breaker and seat belt cutter all in one. Got one for me and one for my mother.
0	it doesnt work: how can it save life if one of them doesnt work?it's a gift. i am pretty disappointed about this product.
1	Miles Davis, Young, but still great!: I bought this yesterday from a local record store and wow. Man is it good. It isn't hs greatest stuff because he was younger and less experienced but it is still absolutely great.
0	Service/Support lacking: This vacuum worked great the first few weeks, did a good job cleaning, was able to get under furniture, and was very quiet and unobstrusive. Then problems started. It ran but wouldn't pick up debris and it seemed like the brushes weren't working. I noticed the end caps had disappeared. The company sent replacement ones for free but this didn't fix problem. Now I can't get customer support on the phone despite waiting extensive stretches on hold, and e-mail support is not reponding. Can't find where to get warranty work done. So vacuum has been inoperable for a couple months. Had to break out the old upright.
1	Very happy customer: A person with a heavy vacuum cleaner could do a better job in the same amount of time. However a person with a heavy vacuum cleaner is not going to sweep my apartment every day for an hour. Roomba will, and the result is that the floor is much cleaner. I run it every morning while I am getting ready for work and have had no problems with it.
1	Roomba Rocks: I have two cats and this is great to pick up cat hair. It goes all over on its own for about an hour. It knows where the steps are and a remote enables me to block off other areas. I use it every day and it is amazing how much it picks up.
0	Do Not Buy This Product!: I purchased this cleaner a year ago to use for my office floor...just about a16 by 20 area. It has never made it around the room yet. It gets stuck, unravels the carpet and tries to suck it up (and gets stuck), gets stuck in the corner. Awful product. I was going to send it back to the manufacturer but figured they'd resell it so I scraped that idea. I am 56 years old and have made many, many purchases over the years. This is the worst product I've ever bought. I feel truly ripped off. Do Not BUY!
0	Work only for1 year: I got this last Christmas of 2004 and it die exactly around Christmas of 2005. So I wouldn't consisder this to be a product but more as a toy to have. To be honest I only use this no more that once every 2 week. So after about 26 uses it die. Well, not exactly dead, but it started doing circle and stop every15 seconds.I never like to write review for a product because it waste my time, but for such a bad product I have to.
0	They only last...maybe a year.: I received the red roobma several years ago and I loved it. I'm a stay at home mother and thought this thing saved my life! After about a year it started acting funny. It would turn in a couple of circles then stop. So last year after IRobot came out with their latest and greatest, I bought one. It was the black scheduler for $329. Not quite a year later it started doing the same thing. I called their customer service and they said the sensors around the wheels were dirty and needed blowing out with a can of air. I did that and it did not help. I sent it back and bought a rechargable hand vac.I'd really be interested to see what all these people have to say about their roomba after1 year.
1	pretty cool.: The Roomba works. I have two cats and it picks up the cat hair that gets everywhere everyday. I used to use a handheld vacuum everyday but now I press clean and I can run errands or knit or learn how to play the piano. It can get annoying to pick up cords everyday, so I figured out a way to remove them. I clean the filter everyday, and I was really surprised to see how much cat hair it picked up. I still vacuum my couch to remove pet hair weekly but people have mentioned that my floors look cleaner than they ever have before. Clean regularly andit works.
1	Watch out dirt and dust !: I've seen the commercials, I've read the reviews and got it with my1-click ! I do mostly all my christmas shopping for the kids on Amazon and decided this year it was time for MY gift.It has been almost a month and so far I can't say anything negative about my purchase. My apartment is small and doesnt require any intense vacuuming and my fascination for gadgets out-weigh anything else. (and any other excuse I can give to have one ) No complaints. My daughter turns it on and we sit back and watch it suck up one area of the room or entire roomSif needed. I even turned the roomba on when I thought there was'nt a need and the darn thing picked up a room full of dust !Yes I'm still very excited about it's capabilities but after a few more months of use I'll be writing another review hopefully about how it still works wonderSMy advice to everyone interested is to GET ONE !!
1	A great (and fun!) tool, esp. for indoor/outdoor carpeting: I was teased pretty roundly for trying out a new "Techie Toy" but I have to say I'm wowed...it really does work!Dog hair, sand, dust, leaves, etc. have all found their way into my Roomba today. The kids room - especially under the beds - has never been quite this clean before. And the finished basement - with the indoor/outdoor carpeting - is spotless.As was previously mentioned, it does get itself into some tight spots. But I found the virtual wall to work quite well in preventing those issues.The charger takes a bit of time too. I'm impatient and admit I've been using it prior to letting it charge fully and it did a great job even on a partial charge.
0	Very Disappointed.: Over a period of about 6 months I purchased 4 Roombas - 2 Pro Elites and 2 Discovery SE. All of them eventually failed. The first one was wonderful. I loved it. It lasted about 2 months. Then it began to simply turn on its axis and beep. I talked to I-Robot and they said it would have to be sent in. Instead I returned it and got another one. That too did the same thing in about a week. I then exchanged that one for a Discovery SE which had just been released thinking that they had probably fixed the problem with a new design. That one didn't even work out of the box. The 2nd Discovery SE lasted about a week and I finally returned it and decided to find another brand.When the Roombas worked they were wonderful but it was extremely frustrating when they stopped performing properly. I'm glad I am rid of them.
1	Fun, Usefull, Requires A Little More Work Than Expected: Okay, so I love this thing.I got it as a gift for my mom, cause we have 8 persian (long hair) cats, and have to vacuum twice a week usually.This thing works like a charm, and picks up hair and dirt you didn't even know was there!Just turn it on once a day and let it run, but there is a little bit of prep work you have to do!1. Make sure no wires, clothes, blankets, etc are on the floors you want it to vacuum. If it runs over something and it gets stuck, it will usually get out, but plugged in cords, t-shirts, and thin blankets tend to stop him.2. In small bathrooms, leave the door fully open (against the wall), because it can get stuck if it bounces around and closes the door on itself.Other than that, charge it, run it, empty the bag (and clean hair out of the rollers), and repeat.Works like a charm!
0	Disposable Electronics: The Roomba idea is clever and they can be handy during the warranty period but after that they are essentially disposable items. iRobot, the manufacturer, has cut so many corners to produce this clever device at a reasonable price that they cannot and will not supply spare parts. Five stars during warranty,1 star thereafter.
0	Battery So Poor, you should only use in a small apartment: My wife and I discovered that the battery use is less than1 hour; and it takes 4 hours to recharge it!If you have a small apartment, this may work for you. If, like us, you have a larger home (2700+ sq ft)- pass this up. The Roomba did a great job of cleaning the bedroom, but used up its battery in the process. There is no way we could use it to clean the entire upstairs in1 day, let alone the whole house. The battery just doesn't last that long.In summary, we returned it after1 week.
1	Surpised by how much I enjoy this CD: I had to play this CD over several times when I first got it, because I needed to be sure of what I had heard. These songs resonated deeply in me immediately. "Holy As a Day Is Spent" and "I Heard an Owl" are arresting songs, powerful in their connections. I remain astounded by how close to my feelings Carrie Newcomer's songs are; it's wonderful to hear my contemplative times articulated so harmoniously.
0	terrible product: I do not see any improve due to the itching problem.it was stated in the brochure that THIS product is under satisfaction guarantee. I called the customer service, and I noticed that the seller misleadinghe will give u the manufacturing phone in UTAH then when u call Utahshe will say you have to call the seller to return your product.BEWARE BUYER !!
1	Pet Gate: Nicely made. Very easy to install. Impotrant - Bottom stays on the floor. Would have been 5 Star if it had a knob/handle on the top (which I added) to make it easier to open and close.
0	less than expected: I've expected more from the disc. The melodies remind one another, the performance also could be better.
0	Pretty pictures, gorgeous yarns, somewhat boring designs: I just got this book for my birthday, and was excited about it, because at the first glance, the book looks nice, and the sweater designs seem sane and comfortable.That is, until I actually looked at the patterns and instructions, and noticed a recurring theme in most of the designs.In fact, many of the instructions in this book seem to more or less go like this:1. Take 2km of hideously expensive yarn.2. Cast on120 stitches, using the biggest needles you can find3. Knit two squares of garter/stockinette stitch.4. Make two sleeves.5. Sew together, leaving a small hole for your head.6. wear your bulky shapeless sweater which only looks nice because the yarn is gorgeous.
1	Fun but difficult: This is a fun compilation of "Animaniacs" songs. Unfortunately, "Animaniacs" songs are so rapid fire that it's hard to keep up if you know the words, much less if you're trying to follow along with the lyrics on screen. (And I'm a grownup!)
1	Great collection: This set of DVD is a nice collection to have if your child likes Thomas. It makes a great gift too! And for the price, 3 DVDs are definitely worth it.
1	Perry Mason Magic: This DVD is a wonderful collection of early Perry Mason. If you are a fan of Perry Mason then I would recommend you purchase this DVD. It is so nice to watch the TV with no commericals, swearing or nude sceens.
1	Classic TV: I grew up watching Perry Mason and now can share them with my own children. The first reaction is a groan but within ten minuetes everyone is gluded to the show and with no sugestive ads that I have to explain.
1	One of the best new bands I've heard in a long time: Loopy pop is how I describe their sound. I grew up in the 80s and was thick in the Indie music scene (back when it actually WAS indie). This is the first band I've heard since then that has a very fresh sound. The first I heard a song, I downloaded a few more and then bought the CD. Listening to the songs, I truly feel like the band is having fun making good music, not copying other bands and trying to make a million bucks. I listen to this CD over and over again.
0	Defective Item: Audio1/4" to1/8" Stereo Adapter does not work. It's a waste of $4. I will not buy anything from EZ Electronic Mall.
1	Your baby will love this!: I received one of these blankets as a gift from my mother. It is SOOO soft, and we took it to the hospital with us when we were delivering. The nurses at the hospital nursery even fell in love with it, and asked where they could buy some! My son stays so warm and loves the feel of it so much we had to go out and buy more of them, as he prefers them over his other blankets. Definitely a great investment!
0	Incoherant, Misquoting, incomprehensible literature!: Many sentences are incomplete, and the author misquotes scripture. The majority of this book are quotes, assumptions, and fiction. He support the majority of minor issues and does not provide evidential support for his own opinions so the reader has no idea how he came up with them.
1	Great music - fits the series!: This is great music. I have not seen any of the anime yet, but I do read the series, and this OST even goes well with that. The period and mood are accurately portrayed by the music. It has just the right mix of happy and creepy. One of the tracks makes me think of an antique carnival where you expect monsters to jump out at you. If you enjoy this series in either form, I would definitely recommend getting this cd.
0	Too Messy, Slow Delivery: While the get started eyes is great, the foundation kit is messy and does not cover as well as advertised. Cover Girl liquid power foundation is better. The company this was ordered from was very slow with delivery.
0	Disappointed: I really did not like this product. I went from being a liquid foundation wearer to this and was very disappointed in the lack of coverage. I was attempting to use this as an alternate means of covering acne scars and uneven skin tones but the end result was yuck! I spent more time trying to apply and reapply to get the a similar result as the liquid foundation.I feel this product is better for someone with less problem skin.
0	Allergic Reaction- Bismuth Oxychloride in this Product: After using Bare Minerals for a Saturday morning and a Sunday morning application I have a horrible sunburn-like dry itchy raw face for 3 days. I previously tried Cover Girl Mineral makeup and had the same reaction, but did not realize the connection until now. I have never had a reaction like this otherwise. Following research online-I discovered that many women suffer this same rash from the Bismuth Oxychloride contained in this product and some other brands like Cover Girl.For those with Sensitive Skin, I would suggest finding a brand without that ingredient. There are several brands that do not contain it.
0	Disappointed: I really wanted to like this movie. I knew it was a lower budget productiuon and I also understand that the short book of Ruth isn't much material to make a full length movie. And to be fair, they did a good job of not straying too far from the Biblical text.However, the acting is weak and the script worse, really bad at points. Dan Haggerty is the only one who can deliver a line and he has just a few. The characters all look like the came from Iowa, not the Middle East. Little things like all the clothes looking brand new and clean make it look more like a Sunday school play than a modern period piece.With a little better directing and a few different actors, this could have been pretty good. Don't expect too much and you won't be too disappointed.
0	Don't bother: The production quality of this movie is shockingly bad and so is the acting. The acting is so terrible that it distracts you from the story. It's really really low budget. If you compare the production of the movie Jeremiah, Esther or Joseph for example which were excellent bible movies this is embarrasingly bad. It's such a pity because the bible book of Ruth is a beautiful account.The Book Of Ruth
1	Great Swing: This swing/bouncer chair has been really great. The only problem that we have is the chair doesn't seem to fully lock into place into the base. My son seems to like the bouncing the best but you have to do this manually. I guess everything cannot be automatic. The strap system is a bit complicated yet holds him safely in the chair.
1	An outstanding must read!: I've just finished this book and could not put it down it was a page turner. This is a new author but he has a feel like E. Lynn Harris however he develpos his own style and goes to a new level of exploring gender issues. The main character Jefferson Daniels is a married man that goes to his fraternity convention and is faced with his deep personal struggle of his same sex, sexual struggle. He meets a man named Adonis who he finds very attractive. All the while Jefferson is dealing with his spirituality and how the world views the desires he has had since childhood. This author explores the relationship with religion and homosexuality, friendship, and heterosexual marraige. The book has twist and turns in it, and is based on true to life stuff. The world better whatch out for this brother. Get your copy today!
1	We waited and requested for 2 long years. Finally.: This is by far the best ever Beauty and the Beast ever written. I bought it years ago and have my hard copy still. When my vision got worse, luckily the Kindle was created and my problem was solved- except that I missed some of my old friends. Then the folks at Amazon added a place where you can (with a click) ask an author to permit a kindle copy. My daughters and I wanted this on Kindle--- We asked repeatedly -- at least every 2 months from all three of us. We prevailed. YAY.
1	Fun!: This story of a San Francisco governess and a magician turned werewolf is an entertaining blend of magic and love. Lacky manages to steer clear of the Disneyfication that could have cropped up in the tale. Alongside the archetypal fairy tale are Chinatown whorehouses and the genral squaller of the seedier part of San Fransisco circa the early 2oth century. Recomended for those times when your head has been buried in Crowley for three weeks and feels as though its about to explode!
1	want your kids to mature??: Jamie's songs do not always say things that are just immediately familiar, but rather he sings about unfamiliar parts of the Bible in ways that will draw children in and make them curious about those unfamiliar parts. He uses children in the singing and very fun little verbal blurbs make my kids want to be a part of it.Another thing about his songs is that they are matter-of-fact about tough parts of Scripture and tough principles and theologically informed. This music will lead children to mature rather than just want to be entertained with happy clapping and dancing bears.Don't get me wrong, these songs will make kids laugh occasionally!
1	Not Free SF Reader: Adventuring with aliens and aztecs.What seems to start off as a run of the mill adventure type tale reminiscent of something that Idriess or Fenimore Cooper might have come up with, develops into something a lot more complex.A human colony is cut off after the closing of a wormhole and the use of emp nuclear weapons devastates the technological level of a planet.Opposing alien races plot and scheme using humans to do their dirty work, while a couple of enhanced humans try and get by on the planet after enduring several centuries of waiting.When one finds the other, the conflict between aliens and humans turns into war. Human sacrifice, airships, seaships, spears, guns and whatever else can be used to fight with, is, as the secret to operating a much more powerful type of ship is fought for.This book ends a lot more strongly than it starts, building nicely throughout.
1	The One--Elton John: Love this CD. I think it is one of Eltons' best--good variety. "Runaway Train" with Calpton is great.
0	I didn't get Techno Bears, I got standard Haribo bears: The product I got, the standard Haribo Golden Bears, get five stars. I didn't order Haribo Golden Bears, I ordered the Techno Bears. Pretty disappointing, be careful about ordering.
0	Roomba worked pretty good for a couple weeks: The Roomba actually worked better than I thought it would. I have a combination of hard and carpeted floors.Even thought it cannot get everywhere, it does get to places you generally do not when vacuuming the old way.I would have been a happy user and given it a good rating, but unfortunatly after a couple weeks it failed. I got an error code stating that a wheel was stuck. The wheel was definately not stuck, but I was unable to get this warning/beep code to stop. Fortunatly I was within the 30 day return period.I would have considered getting it fixed, but considering the poor customer support that is suggested in the reviews, I decided to save myself the trouble of spending hours on the phone.My sense from the start was that it would not function very long, it's fairly cheaply made in my opinion. I did expect it to work longer than a couple weeks though.
1	I was skeptical but I was wrong!: This robot works! This is no toy. When I was given this robot for a gift my first question to my wife was, "Can we return it if it doesn't work?". I was really skeptical. Boy was I wrong! The little robot really cleans, and cleans well! As a test, I vacuumed with our regular upright and then had Roomba come in behind to see if it could pickup anything. After Roomba finished its job, its dirt bin was full! It's worth every penny!
0	Durability Problems: I have had two ROOMBAs (A Discovery and Discovery SE) for about five months now. We have three German Shepherds, multiple cats and a large house. Our ROOMBAs are used twice daily on the MAX setting.Although they clean well I've had lots of problems keeping them functional with multiple cliff sensor and brush drive failures despite cleaning them, cleaning the brushes and blowing them out with air after each use. The folks at I Robot have been great about replacing them under warranty but the process is beginning to get tiresome. I can only conclude that long-term durability is, at best, questionable and that maintenance is far greater than that of a "normal" vacuum. The whole equation adds up to time saved having a robot vacuum = zero.
1	My wife loves her Roomba: This thing is practically a member of our family. My wife loves it. It works very well for us, with wood floors and not much carpeting. It doesn't do well with thick carpeting, but oriental-type rugs are fine. It has some trouble with the transition from floor to rug if the rug is very thick with a pad under it, but the rug can be done separately if this happens.It's easy to clean and use. We're still using the original filter after about 6 - 8 months.Everyone who gets one loves it.
0	A Pain...: to remove the hair/fur from the brushes, and then have to go and grab the regular vacuum cleaner to clean up the post roomba clean up mess...
1	Better then I thought it could be: I love my Roomba!! I am so amazed with what this little machine can pick up. I have wood floors, tile, low carpet and thick carpet, and it works on all of them. It doesn't mark the wood floors, and it picks up very fine dirt and dust. Believe me I give it a work out with two 3 year olds running around. If you purchase be sure to take good care and empty the dirt compartments often and clean the brushes. It doesnt have a large capacity. Jeannine
1	Great CD: My lovely Pat has one of the GREAT voices of her generation. I have listened to this CD for YEARS and I still LOVE IT. When I'm in a good mood it makes me feel better. A bad mood just evaporates like sugar in the rain. This CD just oozes LIFE. Vocals are jusat STUUNNING and lyrics just kill. One of life's hidden gems. This is a desert isle CD in my book. Why she never made it big is just beyond me. Everytime I play this, no matter black, white, young, old, male, female EVERYBODY says one thing "Who was that singing ?"
1	One of the best game music soundtracks - for a game I didn't really play: Despite the fact that I have only played a small portion of the game, the music I heard (plus the connection to Chrono Trigger which was great as well) led me to purchase the soundtrack, and it remains one of my favorite albums. There is an incredible mix of fun, epic, and emotional songs. Those sad and beautiful tracks I especially like, as there's not too many of those kinds of songs in my other video game soundtracks. I must admit that one of the songs (Life-A Distant Promise) has brought tears to my eyes on many occasions.My one complaint about this soundtrack is that they use guitar fretting effects in many of the songs, which I find distracting. But even if those weren't included I would still consider the collection worth it.
0	Batteries died within a year ...: I bought this charger in Jul 2003 and it worked OK for a while. The design is nice and convenient. However, after about a year, the batteries would not hold a charge. Might as well just get alkaline disposables, or look elsewhere for a charger that comes with batteries that have better staying power.
1	works fine, but Maha Energy is better: Check out Maha Energy's website. Their Powerex MH-C204F charger works in100 minutes for rapid charge, with option for slower charge (better for batteries). And they have 2200 mAh batteries.
1	Great for the non-audiophile: Reviewed quite a bit of the combo players and was hesitant due to unfavorable reviews and size of machines. I am weaning off my VHS collection, but don't want to replace them with DVD's. This unit is well built, easy to setup and resolution and special effects (no progressive scan for HDTV owners) suitable for many people looking for a versatile product.Cons- No universal remote.
0	DVD Player crapped out after one year: I also began having the incorrect disc problems that I've read about on here. The VCR still works, but hte DVD side is useless. I understand that DVD players sometimes just quit on you, but after not even one year? To me that's a sign on bad quality. I'm giving up JVC after this as well. I'm sticking to Sony or giving another brand a shot.
0	Incorrect Disc: I love the style of this, but after a couple years, the DVD is giving me problems. It doesn't even work anymore and I use my broken PS2 Now. I wouldn't recommend this, I'm just going to upgrade to a recorder now. I wish it would work but I guess i'm giving up on JVC. I really did like this one... before it stopped working. The dvd player gave me problems probably after a year of having it.
0	DVD menu select problems: I cannot scroll through a DVD menu that is set up vertically. The triangle keys will only select horizontally. So I cannot select anything on most DVD's besides play. No special features, no language select, nothing, just play.
1	Unique Weird Orientalia from the1930's: Exotic tales of the Orient from the1930's. "Dr Shen Fu", a Weird Tales magazine reprint, is about the elixir of life that grants immortality at a price. If you're tired of modern authors who all sound alike, this is the antidote for you. Owen's palette is loaded with splashes of Chinese and Japanese colours. Marvelous.
0	Not an "ultimate guide": Firstly,I enjoyed the format and tone of the book (how the author addressed the reader). However, I did not feel that she imparted any insider secrets that the book promised to reveal. If you are just starting to research law school, and do not know all the requirements of admission, then this book may be a tremendous help. If you have done your homework and are looking for an edge when it comes to admissions, I recommend some more topic-specific books. For example, books on how to write your personal statment, books geared specifically towards LSAT preparation (Powerscore books were the most helpful for me), and there are some websites with great advice geared towards aiding the individuals whom you are asking to write letters of recommendation. Yet, for those new to the entire affair, this book can definitely clarify the requirements for you.
1	Great book for travelling Europe: I currently live in Europe, and this is the book I recommend for my visitors. It covers many countries, colour pictures, and is a nice starter for before you go, and once you are there.
0	Not!: If you want to listen to El Duke , then it is better if you have access to his shower,this is not him, it is a gimmick,very well orchestrated.
0	A complete Bust: This game requires quicktime 5.0 to work...if you have a better version of quicktime (I have 7.5), it will ask you to install the quicktime available on the CD...if you click no, it will not let you play. So, I begrudgingly clicked yes on the third try, and it installed quicktime 5, THEN it tells me to please install the quicktime available on the disc. It KEPT telling me that, even after I uninstalled my version of quicktime 7.5, and reinstalled Barbie Rapunzel and quicktime 5. Very frustrating, and the game absolutely will not work for me. It keeps telling me over and over, to install quicktime 5, tho I've been through the installation process repeatedly. It is NOT my "operating system limitations". This is a brand new computer...merely weeks old with all the state of the art contraptions.
1	TRULY MADE A DIFFERENCE!: I have been using this product for a couple years now. I started using it because my hair had gotten so dry from all the chemical treatments and relaxers. This actualy came in the relaxer kit. I tried it and could not beleive the difference it made with one use. I could not find it in any of the stores at the time so I searched Amazon and they had it. I absolutely love it. It is the best moisturizing product I have used so far. My hair is soft with good elasticity and it is not breaking anywhere close to what it was. I am very happy with it.
0	didn't run off of USB bus power: Was hoping that this drive would run off of bus power, but it required the adapter to actually work. :( I sent it back.
0	Don't buy!: First of all, the company took my money and sent me an email telling me the product was shipped. A week and a half later I received another email telling me that they are sorry, but they don't actually have any of these items, and if I received an email telling me it has shipped, it was a mistake.When I finally got my money back, I went through another company to buy the product and it won't work with my phone, even though it depicts that it will. I have sent numerous emails to the company - I can't actually find a phone number on their website - and I still have not gotten any kind of response. What kind of customer service is that? No one will help me with this problem. My advice - don't waste your money!
1	Simple, Durable, Fun game for all ages: This is an AWESOME game! Almost everyone know tic-tac-toe so it is EASY to learn and quick to play. You can't play just once! The twist is that your pieces are slightly different sizes - just big enough to gobble up your opponent. The first person to make tic-tac-toe wins, but it's not as easy as it looks when you're stuck in the mindset of just making three in a row and forget about the gobbling possibilities! My 4 and 5 year olds will beat me even when I'm trying to win! Excellent beginning critical thinking game. Grandparents loved playing it with the kids too.
1	Review of Kelly Club for Toddlers: For the price of 7.99, this PC game is WELL worth it, great graphics, colorful and lots to do! My four year old daughter is in love with the many tasks to complete in this game, including dressing and grooming wide variety of pets and decoration of numerous floats to show in your little one's very own parade.
1	SOY UN APASIONADO DEL BOX: Y ESTE LIBRO ESTÁ ESPLÉNDIDO !Lo disfrutas, lo puedes usar como obra de consultaNos trae LAS HISTORIA DE LOS BOXEADORES MÁS BRILLANTES, DE LOS CAMPEONES DURANTE CIEN AÑOS !!Si te gusta el box...¡NO TE LO PIERDAS !
1	Some of the best fiddle playing I have heard in a long time: This is an excellent album with some great fiddle playing. Ryan is amazing to watch when he plays in person. You can feel the emotion he puts into each song.
0	Long and boring: I've read this book with much expectation, it was very boring all through out the book
0	Dont like it: This product smells when you open the package and it appears one of the gel cushions leaks so I spent $10 and havent worn then. I wouldnt buy this product again. Dont waste your money on something you may not be able to use.
1	one of the last in the series to collect !: The magazine was in very good condition and had the usual high standard of articles and photos that Victoria magazine has come to represent. I have collected all the previous magazines of the series and still enjoy leafing through them on a rainy day
1	Sony Hi8 Camcorder with 2.5 LCD: I believe I will be very happy with the camcorder. Its small,light and easy to handle.The LCD is clear and bright.Ease of operation.
0	Don't Take the Chance - Get the SE Branded Cable: If you purchase this data cable, you need to know that you will receive no real directions or information regarding what to check if nothing works. As directed, I downloaded all of the files from the SE site (70MB on dial up!), and then downloaded all of the user guides. Everything seemed to install ok, but nothing would make my phone be recognized. After that I scoured the SE site for troubleshooting info on their branded cable-in the hope that something would help me figure out the problem. After 2 full days of beating my head against the wall, I finally threw the cable and the useless CD that came with it in the trash.If I had used my brain I would have paid the extra $$ for a SE branded cable and software (and the support that comes along with that). I now have the real deal (SE data cable and software), and guess what? Yep, installation was a breeze and it works beautifully. You really do get what you pay for.
0	MANSON HATES EMMONS.: Watch Charlie on video in an interview and hear for yourself him say,"Emmons took his life, and put that in my book..then he took my life, and wrote a second book with his name on it and said it was his life..so he's milked you for two books.. he's a good crook."The way Charlie himself talks about the book indicates that less than1 percent is factual.
0	Lies, Lies, Lies: For all of you who are under the illusion that this book is in Charlie's own words, you're mistaken. At the time of the so called interviews, the author was not allowed any sort of writing utensils, tape recorders, etc. The words you see are those of the authors. Same old media hype to make a buck. The author betrayed Charlie by pretending to be his 'friend'. This is why Charlie declines so many interviews. Everybody distorts everything he has ever said. So my advice is: If you want to read the authors take on Charlie, buy it. If you want the TRUTH, don't buy it.
0	REALLY CMON NOW LETS GET REAL!!!!!!!!!!!!: DO you really think that this stuff is going to work? especially the trapping? so many people love trapping but when then try it in sparring it doesnt work.the lin lop sau,the bong lop sau,the same hand tan to lop sau-cmon now none of that works against anyone who doesnt leave their hand out there after they throw a punch! this may have been how people fought hundreds if not a thousand years ago but it certainly isnt practical now! if you want to spend lots of your precious time learning an art that most of it you cant use in sparring or in the street then so be it.but like bruce said "man {or for that matter any person man or woman} is MORE IMPORTANT than any art or system" even applies to jkd and wing chun-not the other way around!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1	I couldn't put it down: Nappily Ever After was a true page turner. I couldn't put it down. Venus was a down to earth character that I could relate too. You wanted to know how the story turned out by the first chapter, I was tempted to read the last chapter right after the first. I look forward to more books By Trisha R. Thomas. I wish it could have went the other way, but the author made it very believable.
0	sadly predictable: If you don't like to be surprised in the least bit, this novel is for you. If you don't mind the writer's technique or don't see literary language necessary to be entertaining then you too will like this book. I, on the other did not. The plot was predictable,the characters were one-dimensional and the language reminded me some what of McMillan. ( an unpolished McMillan, of course.) The best part of this book was the cover, and that was just not enough to keep me satisfied.
0	Struggled Through!: I struggled through this book. The storyline was a bore! I was also anxious to read this book as it was highly recommended, but too was I disappointed. If you absolutely have to read this book, borrow it from someone or the library!
0	Klaatu Hopeless: I purchased the original Klaatu album on vinyl in1976. I love the album as much now on CD as it did then. However "Hope" is far too theatrical, with virtually no actual songs on it. If I could give it0 stars I would.
1	A Must read: This book and author were interviewed on Friday16 April by Bill Moyers on PBS. Fascinating. The book is insightful and explains so much we in the west truly do NOT understand. All government officials need to read this! Well written. Makes you think.
1	A unique take on a classic theme: I really enjoyed this book with the exception that the story was slightly disjointed at times. There are sudden jumps in the story and one in particular in which a large chunk of plot seems to suddenly go missing. Aside from these short comings, however, The science & plot work well together. The characters are reasonably complex & the universe captivating.
1	One Brave Act changes a civilization: this story is gripping in part because the 2 female protagonists honestly feel they are making the best decisions that will affect the whole crew. They are severely opposed to each others approach despite being close friends originally. The act of the captain to pursue the fleeing "object" and thus stranding here crew forever, inspires the entire human race to pursue a future in space and fulfill some aspect of a larger destiny. That this comet takes them to the end of time and space has its own amazing affect on the crew, there is a span of billions of years. This book is about responsibility and living up to it, including taking ownership for a vision and a mistake. great read
1	GREAT Dali book .... Great Amazon price: Love the book, love dealing with Amazon.com I've been dealing with Amazon for years now, and have never had a problem with them. THANKS ONCE AGAIN AMAZON.
1	Great space heater!: It swivels, has a remote and a tipover safety feature, and you can mount it on the wall if you desire. It works wonderfully, providing plenty of heat when you need it.
1	Thorough and interesting look at this most intriguing literary woman.: After watching the Masterpiece Theatre presentation of "Portrait of a Marriage" years ago, I went on a search for more information about the life of Vita Sackville-West. This bio was one of the gems overturned in that quest for treasure. Having only been able to find it in UNCA's library at the time, I was delighted to be able to stumble over it again during a search at Amazon.com. I have now made it a permanent addition to my extensive library of a subject I call "The Three V's." The three V's are: Vita Sackville-West, Violet Trefusis, and Virginia Woolf, three women joined via literary and emotional attachment with Vita Sackville-West acting as the hinge.
0	Buyer Beware!!: If I'd only read the reviews before purchasing this for my 6 year old I would never have bought it! It is VERY flimsy and top heavy. The elevator gets stuck and it does take awhile to put together. As I was driving all over town looking for the best price I wondered why no store had the batcave out on display. Once we got it together I realized why. We ended up taking off the bottom poles and moving some of the parts around so it would stop falling over. We have lots of batman toys and other mattel products. This is by far the biggest disappointment in10 years of toy buying. If it wasn't from Santa it would be going back without a doubt. Buy anything else!
0	This will be an additional toy for next spring's yard sale: Our almost 4 year old couldn't wait to get this toy to add to his super hero collection. It looks great on the box. However, this is by far the worst toy we have purchased for any of our kids in almost 8 years. It is so flimsy and cheaply built. Pieces fall off and it tips a lot. Hopefully it will be re-designed with sturdier materials. If you are considering purchasing it...don't...you'll save your self some money and frustration.
0	Worst scanner I've owned.: I was looking forward to a new scanner after my HP died after just a year. I purchased this one based on the several good reviews on Amazon and other sites.Now that I have the scanner I am sorely disappointed. The picture quality is horrible. No matter the tweaking I do in the scanner dialog, the picture is faded and grainy.The software itself is the least useful interface I've ever worked with. The "auto" buttons makes the image worse, the image area recognition has never yet gotten it right, and the most useful feature only applies if you are sending the scan to Paperport, something I never want to do.
1	A Must for Handgunners - Old and New: This is a great reference for anyone considering using handguns as self-defense. Even experienced people should have a book like this as a refresher and reference. Is it perfect? No, such a short book is only so comphrensive. But it manages to impart a lot of knowledge nonetheless and anyone who thinks they know a lot about guns should study the experts. See alsoThe Seven Myths of Gun Control: Reclaiming the Truth About Guns, Crime, and the Second Amendment.
0	Lousy Camera: This is the first time I post a review because I am compelled to do so.I bought this camera to use during the Christmas holidays. I tried to use it the first time to take a picture of the Christmas tree, all I saw was complete darkness. Then I realized that I needed more light. So I turned on all the lights in the house and it was still darkness. If you plan to use this camera indoor, please forget about it! No way.It isn't that great outdoor neither. I took many pictures with the automatic exposure setting. It cannot handle anything with a bright background. It will just be VERY bright.I tried to use it on the ski slopes. I think it is because of the cold temperature, the camera has to be reset often. To make the matter worse, the pictures turned out literally "twisted".I can't belive a HP camera can have so many flaws. Very disappointing. Please don't buy one.
0	Piece of junk: Camera is only usable outside in broad daylight. Trying anything inside your home/place of business and you'll have nothing but black on your screen.I am returning the product and will probably try lifeview camera with flash to see if camera aperture allows more light in.I was in rooms that were pretty well lit up...and viewfinder is dark as night.Should never have been released as a product because of these flaws...and it doesn't have to be this way. Laptop usb cameras offer incredibly bright pictures in low light conditions.
1	Video too!: I was very impressed with it. It take stills and movie clips great and it so small. Great pocket p.c. add on .
1	Motown Heaven -- The Soundtrack for Boomers!: This 3 CD album is a wonerful collection of the "best" of Motown, in which the Holland/Dozier/Holland tagline under the title of the record meant high quality R&B;, and almost always resulted in a mega-hit. The collection begins with the very earliest hit -- Eddie Holland singing "Jamie", and proceeds through most of the major early hits of The Miracles, The Supremes, Martha and the Vandellas, Mary Wells, The Marvalettes, The 4 Tops, the Isley Brothers, and more.This CD replaces my old collection of 45 RPM recordings, and has allowed me to enjoy the Motown Sound without haaving a huge number of CD's to collect. The one downside about this wonderful collection is that the 3rd CD contains mostly less well-known tunes, with the exceeption of two Diana Ross/Supremes cuts: "My World is Empty Without You" and "Forever Came Today". In all, the collection is a terrific value and brings back fond memories: The soundtrack to my teenage years; Rock On!!
1	Great true crime read: I really have to give this author credit, as far as being able to be so objective in writing about her cousin's killers, and the police detectives who forced a confession from her innocent brother. The book presents its facts on the case, leaving us to our own conclusions. What is so ironic about the case is that the cousins were going to the Old Chain of Rocks Bridge to read an anti-racism poem written by one of the victims, only to be brutally murdered by a gang of the minorities that she was probably referring to.A very fast and good read.
0	static central: Audio playback through this extension is terrible -- constant static. I have used it with multiple sources and playback devices, speakers and headphones, and all have the same result, static. Replaced it with a higher quality cable and the problem was solved. Not worth the hassle of trying to get a replacement when the cable only cost $3 shipped to begin with.
0	I expected something better: EDIT: I updated this review in response to comments and changes in the product description.When I purchased the cable the product photo showed gold-plated connectors, and existing reviews (Jose Lima 2007, Larkenfield 2007) mentioned separately insulated wires and gold-plated connectors, so that's what I originally thought I was going to get.The cable I received had nickel-plated connectors; it did not have separately insulated wires. It worked, but the sound started cutting out after less than a month and I've long since thrown the cable away.Given at least one other reviewer of this product (Joseph Z. Singer 2012) didn't get what they expected based on the product description, I think it's safe to say that the product photo and the descriptions of the product in all but the most recent reviews is unreliable. If I were you, I'd buy from another shipper.
0	Somewhat worked for 30 days....now starting to fail: Update...so the workaround described below work for about 33 days...just outside the return window. The tracks that play in just the left headset channel do not come through. I've tried 2 sets of ear buds and one set of over the ear headsets...all have the same issue. Plug the same headsets into the source (PC), all channels play out of both ear.WOULD NOT RECOMMEND PURCHASING THIS ITEM.---Out of the box, if I plug my ear buds from my iPhone into the extension (fully connected in the female end) I only get sound out of the right ear bud. Verified the same condition with a pair of JVC ear buds as well. I have found if you insert the male end of the headphones into the extender to the first "click" (not fully inserted), sound comes from both ear buds. There is tension with it connected in this fashion, so it works but could be better. Others may have better luck with other headphones.
0	Freud is crazy!: I've studied philosophy to a good degree and therefore and to read some of Freud's work in Philosophy of Psychology. While making some entertaining remarks, Freud has now long been discounted as anything valid and understandably so.
1	If life is a dream, then don't wake me up: This book is a watershed in human intellectual history. In it Freud undermines the picture of mankind as primarily a being of reason, and presents the idea that we are all creatures of our wishes, our inner unconscious lives. Dreams are not nothing, and they are not in Freud's eyes rare religious gifts, but rather to the key to our own mental life. Freud in this book presents a vast world of examples and interpretations .I am not a psychologist and do not consider myself competent to really judge how much of what Freud presents here is valid or even capable of scientific testing. I do know that this work is one which like a great literary masterpiece has inspired countless interpretations and reinterpretations.Understanding human Intellectual History is now impossible without knowing this work.
1	It arriived: Ordered it. It arrived quickly. It is used and is as described . I'll update whenever I read it. d
1	Barely Unbeatable Theory: Freud's "The Interpretation of Dreams" is a unique book. His treatise on human dreams is truly a product of a brilliant mind. But neither the process of creation itself nor not the results and findings it brought out are the true wonders of this book. The great achievement of Freud's theory is its immunity to criticism. In other words, it is virtually impossible to criticize the results and propositions inserted in this book. His main tenet - a dream is a fulfillment of a desire - cannot be attacked in any intelligible way. If one says for instance that an unpleasant dream or a bloody nightmare is clearly not the fulfillment of a desire, Freud would promptly mention masochism or self punishment. Or, if one finally brings forth a dream that is surely not a desire fulfilled, he might nonetheless say there is at least a desire accomplished, viz: the desire to destroy Freud's dream theory.
1	When did Grandpa die and what do we tell the kids?: Grandma and a brother? That's just weird. I'm a Grandfather of a Five year old Granddaughter and I, I!, bought my Granddaughter the dollhouse and the full set of house furniture. What the, no, wtf were they thinking? Simpletons rule the fricking world. Grandma? Grandpa. Brother? Sister. Idiots.That said my Granddaughter loves this entire set. Full on wonderful for her, and yes if they came out with Grandpa with a sister I would buy both sets, throw the older brother away and give her the rest so maybe their not idiots, just soulless vampires.
0	Amazon.com sent wrong size: Amazon.com sent the wrong size engine oil cooler than what I ordered. Rather than sending it back I made due but it didn't work out like I wanted it to because the cooler was wider than what I originally ordered.
1	One of the best of the Marco Polo Josef Strauss series.: This is one of the best of Marco Polo’s Josef Strauss Edition. Mika Eichenholf allows to quick polkas to gallop fleetly, the march has plenty of swagger, the polkas mazur have poise, and there is a lilt and a joy in the waltzes that make you welcome rather than dread the many repeats. Josef Strauss often succeeded in creating dances in the minor key, but there are none of them here. What is here is his last composition, the “Hesperus-Bahnen Waltz”, published as Op 279, after the forty-three year old composer’s death.
1	Janet, is the Best female singer!: I watched The Velvet rope tour on HBO and it was the bomb, it was the greatest tour that I have ever seen, everything was choreographed pefectly, the music was slammin and Janet really communicated with her fans. When she sang "I get Lonely", "Nasty" and "You", it sent me Crazy. I love you Janet!
1	Another Great Addition To The Buddy Holl(e)y Story!: If you are a totally out of control Buddy Holly fan (like I am), then this book is a "must have" for your library! It adds a great deal of information about Buddy and his performances in England and is well written and researched with some great bibliographic information!
1	Captivating: Very simply, I was unable to put this book down. Not unlike some of the other reviewers I too was on my way to Boston on business whilst reading this "glued to my seat" book. For the first time, I can say that I was pleased for all the flight delays as I managed to finish reading this book on route. I am an avid reader and can say without reservation that Rapid Descent was easily as good as any of the books being written by some of the better known authors, such as Crichton, Grisham, Cook etc to name a few of my favorites. Well Done Dr. Jack when's the next one.....
1	Sure she's a little annoying... BUT.: Yes, by reading every review we all know by now that Sheri is a wee bit annoying, and her "participants" are an interesting sort of people, AND YES it did put my husband in a coma like trance everytime we watched it. BUT everything in this DVD is so valuable! I learned everything I needed to know through this DVD without taking more time off work to go to classes. And since it was always available to me by the touch of a button I was able to review the important things while I was acually in labor. I had to kill time waiting for my contractions to be 5 mins apart before we went to the hospital, so I popped in the DVD, and trust me my husband was no longer in a trance, he was taking notes! This was my first child and thanks to Sheri my labor was only12 hour and I only pushed for 20 mins, 3 good ones and he was out! I think doing what Sheri says and waiting till your dialated 5 cm before you get an epideral was really key.
1	Great Information: My husband and I got more out of this than the free classes the hospital nurses give. We've been able to watch it over for things we missed. There is tons of useful information...too much to take in at once. I love having it becasue if I forget something I just re-watch that section. Its helped us become familar with the terms the nurses use and we have great information for question asking when we go to our Dr. Apts.
1	Good Overview and Very Informative: I really enjoyed this DVD, it provided good content at a nice pace. I highly recommend this DVD.
1	Superb!: When I was 5 months pregnant, I'm desperate to take Child Birth Class in order to help me have Normal Delivery. I searched over the net the best detailed class. Voila! I came accross this product on one of my searches. I never had second thoughts of ordering this product. I regularly viewed and applied all the techniques taught on DVD. It really works! I had an easy labor plus I had Normal Delivery. Superb! I recommend this DVD for those who wanted a Modern and comprehensive Child Birth Class. - Margery Bermejo (Davao City, Philippines)
0	Pretty and very BORING!: WOW! I was hoping this game wouldn't be as bad as people said. It really sucks! No fun at all. Pretty to look at on my1080p-but that's it. Fun-factor = 3/10 Glad I only paid 37.00 for it. In a nutshell, if you're under15 yrs old, you will love this game! If not, spit on it. What a waste.
0	why do you pay someone to write your reviews?: I tried this cream and now have to go to a dermatologist because of a skin reaction. The only positive feedback comes from a feedback pro. Don't believe me.......read the other "reviews" they have left. Buyer beware....any company that has to pay someone to write their reviews needs to put out a better product so real reviews can be written.
1	Enjoyable and Instructive: I bought the Drawing & Painting Fantasy Beasts and the Fantasy Figures books for our high school library. The kids really enjoy them and so do I. I just signed on to see what else might be in this series and to order more copies. While these books may not appeal to everyone (not enough step-by-step for true beginners), the layout and abundance of good pictures and ideas will grab most readers and artists.
1	HOLIDAY TREASURE: Barry Corbin ends up with a Korean family that he never knew he had. He is gruff and not accepting of his visitors, not even friendly, but soon mellows during the Christmas season. The usual characters are here - a wonderful series that should have lasted longer. This chapter is just another example of great acting and terrific writing. I enjoyed the old VHS and it arrived in perfect shape. Wonderful, family entertainment.
1	A very good book.: Normally I am the kind of person who goes for books with adventure and fantasy in them. But hey, I tried this one out and loved it. It's not as fast paced as some of the books I've read, but that suprisingly didn't matter. I suggest anyone read it.
0	NaST like a teST: I am in college now and i had to take a teST on this book when i was i the seventh grade. At that time i hated the book. i thought it was even more naST than Jhonny Tremain. i just wanted to make a mast on that book. it was so boring i just fell asleep. i would not reccomend this book to anyone and i would tell someone to read The Future of Us instead. i just fealt like making a naST in this book and putting it away so when the next person like juSTice reads it they would see my naST and think the book was naST. what a disappointment
0	Only one part was good in this whole book: This book is about some girl from Barbados named Kit Tyler who has to move to Wethersfield, Connecticut. First of all, the characters are the most boring people in the world. The plot stinks. There barely is a plot. I like books where there is a lot of action and the story mountain has bumps along the way. This book, there is no mountain and they just go on flat ground (just to let you know I'm being metaphoric here) and then go up a little hill. The only reason I actually gave this book a star is because the witch trials and where Kit is running away is kind of suspenseful. Just don't read this book it isn't good.
0	OK: This book was ok to me. It dragged on quite a bit but I really liked the ending. I didn't like how it would talk about the same thing for over 3 chapters. It just felt like it wasn't my kind of book. However, I liked the last part. The last 5 chapters were probably that only part I liked.
0	Boring: After purchasing this for our home library, I couldn't wait to read it before my children did. I was bored and unenthused throughout the reading. The author made great attempts at historical accuracy, just not enough with character or plot development. The story must have been born of facts first, as the characters just seemed thrown about and inconsistent. Along with the lack of plot, those inconsistencies are what make this a brutal read. I can't imagine either of my young avid readers enjoying this book and all its predictabilities.
0	Very bad work by Elizabeth Speare review for Mr. Jones: I think this book was boring. The only exciting part is the witch hunt. Most of the time they talked about polatics. If they wern't the were cring over petty grevences such as love. This is why this story was boring. The characters were annoying and obtuse, it was hard reading such a disgusting piece of lititure. Kit was such an unintelligent and snooty creature it was infurating to read about. The women were either self-centered or meek, the thought about love all the time. The men disscussed politics like a change would end the world and the men thought women were dirt. Nat and the cat were the only intellegent creatures. The characthers are just lacking perwsonality and intellegence.
1	Love this book: I have read this book several times since I was a pre-teen. It's like visiting an old friend each time. I love it. One of my all time favorites.
1	The Witch of Blackbird Pond: The Witch of Blackbird Pond is a good book. It is about the early American settlers, the Puritans and their witch trials. Kit has recently moved to America from a Barbadoes after her father's death. What she finds there are strict religious rules, pious settlers, and bad fashion. But she takes refuge in the company of Hannah, who is called evil because she is a Quaker. When Hannah is acused of casting sickness on the town and escapes, the town acuses Kit. In the end, Kit must learn to change her attitude and the town must learn to conquer religious differences.
0	An interesting but predictible book: This book was semi interesting. I liked certain parts, but compared to other books, this one was too predictible. I prefered the book, Beyond the Burning Time. Not only was it better, it was less predictable and more interesting! But read the two books for yourself and you can decide!
0	A Girl who lost everything takes her chances in Wethersfield: This book was an overall1 star book. The quality of the dialogue was horrible because it was very unrealistic. This book was also very boring and drawn out because it did not have a lot of action. The characters, however were very interesting and original. The events were very boring and predictable.
0	Extremely poor continuation: I am a big Jane Austen's fan, and I love to read the continuations and sequels. However, I had trouble finishing this book. The break in the writing between Austen's original text and the addition is glaring. The style changes, the characters change, the plot leaps wildly. It's almost like two books -- the author shouldn't have bothered keeping the original text. She probably would have done better rewritting it to fit her own style. I highly recommend reading the other Sanditon continuation by Anne Telscombe instead. It does a seamless job of continuing and the characters stay in character.
0	very dull and witless: This was a dull read that I had to force myself to finish. The plot wanders aimlessly and is hard to follow. Mnay of the other continuations are better than this so I would recommend saving your money.
0	Not for kids under12 years old: While the finished product--a working phone with see-through cover and flashing lights--is great, this toy is definitely not easy to assemble. It took a bright 9-year-old, her 40-year-old aunt, and the child's grandfather (well-versed in electronics) two hours or more to finally get all the pieces in place! The parts seem to be well made and the phone really *does* work, but the directions are very difficult to understand and there was no explanation whatsoever of how a phone works. In short, what was supposed to be a fun "learning experience" turned out to be an exercise in frustration. This kit is probably best suited for teenagers or adults who already have some background in electronics.
1	Compact Phono: Portable And Plays 78 RPMs: This battery operated little jewel allows playing of old 78's and stillsounds reasonable in it's single onboard speaker mode. It also has thestandard stereo outputs to drive an external soound system for all threeRPMs. All this and it's built to pack around.My wife called it one of the best electronics purchases I've ever made..
1	A great, varied album.: Techno, house, ambient, dance, electronica, whatever you want to call it, "Everything is Wrong" is just great music by a great artist. It has everything a fan of pop music could want.
1	THE favorite book in our house.: We love reading this book to our six month old. It has a rhythm to it that makes it so much fun. The illustrations are adorable and the story-line is very creative. The cardboard books are best for a young baby who likes to turn the pages too.I give this book as gifts all the time.
0	Very concerned about The Einstein Syndrome: First of all, I am quite offended by this author. I am a licensed speech-language pathologist with 30 years of experience in the public school system. I am currently working as a special education coordinator in (heaven forbid) a public school system. I read about children and their issues/concerns/characteristics continuously. This book was recommended by a parent and I was very excited to read it. I was not prepared for the assault on speech-language pathologists and others in the public schools of America. I truly wish the author would do a more thorough investigation of our credentials and our job performances. We are not in the business of "creating business". Believe me, we have plenty to keep us busy. We are, however, very dedicated to children and their needs....whether that involves "Einstein type children", Asperger's, Autistic, Hyperlexic, Attention Deficit Disordered, Gifted or any of the multitude of diagnoses.
1	Einstein Syndrome...Bright Children Who Talk Late: If you have a child that is late with speech development, seems frustrated with communications, strong willed & defiant, prone to tantrums, good at solving puzzles, loving but sometimes aloof, concentrates on some tasks, ignores requests to perform other tasks, not the least interested in potty training, exhibiting some autistic or PDD tendancies but having exceptional memory and suprising intelligence, then you need to get this book. Don't be put off by reviews of the professionals, the book has some information that will help concerned parents bypass those professional egos and cut to the main issue, how to best understand and help your child.
1	How to go to College Almost for Free: I bought this for my grandson, he has already written in for several grants, and working on more. This is a great gift for any high school kid, and even kids in college. I don't believe the parents should go into debet for this, the kids will do much better if they have to work for it. I've seen to many parents almost go broke with several kids at college at the same time. They end up with nothing for retirement. Believe me, you need a nest egg.Take if from a grandma that has a great pension.
1	Cool Book: I'm not much for writing book reviews, but this book was so good that I decided to do so anyway. The author has really done a comprehensive treatment of the subject of college scholarships. This is the scholarship book to get.
1	How To Go To College For Almost Free: This book is very informative. Ben Kaplan manages to convey the information in a fun and lighthearted manner. This is a great book for parents and students alike.
0	The academic types love it.: I guess it makes one feel intellectually in touch if he can praise this book. I guess I will never make it to that level, because I think this is one terrible book. I read approximately100 pages on the traits of Fox Edwards, therefore, I was a little upset when I found out it was for no reason. I read with interest the last few pages where I found out that Wolfe's editor had to piece together several parts of this book, and then he had to write many pages in order to tie this mess together. All of this occured after Wolfe's death. I believe this is a collection of ramblings from Thomas Wolfe. I am sure that I can be attacked verbally for not understanding the meaning of this great work, but if it was truly a great work, I would not have missed its significance. Please, play with the kids, walk around the block, start drinking, but don't waste your time on this book.
1	THE great American literary genius of the 20th Century.: Let's see now ... have you bought in to the "PowerPoint," bullet-ed, "concise" notion of literature (i.e., stupid, undeveloped, soul-less notion of expressing what it is to be human?) --In THAT case, you will find the works of Thomas Wolfe (as you find the works of Marcel Proust or Thomas Mann) a great big bore. Otherwise ... you will NOT find them a bore; but the very opposite of a bore:--a source of inspiration, of joy, of excitement, of the quintessence of life.
1	Orson Welles and Magic: I have always been a fan of Orson Welles on radio and television. Having collected a ton of radio broadcasts on CD and audio cassette and having watched most of his movies, I appreciate the genius of his work. I picked up a copy of this book recently and am amazed at the amount of research put into it. An aspect of Welles rarely discussed is his magic career. At the Mid-Atlantic Nostalgia Convention this September in Aberdeen, Maryland, I plan to attend the presentation about Orson Welles and his magic career so I can watch rare footage and films with Welles, and get an even deeper insight to his trickery. Book comes recommended.
1	Used It For Years: We've used this product for many years. It cleans stainless steel coffee pots perfectly. They shine better than they did when new.
0	Poor Service from Home and Beyond: I still have not receivied what I ordered and paid for. They claim the first shippemnt was damaged and have yet to ship a replacement. Three phone calls were not returned from them. The vendor is very slow to resolve the problem. They said it would be here last week, now it is this week. I have no confidence that they will ever deliver the product.
0	Vapid and vacuous: The main character was insufferable. Parker has tried to create a male Spencer but fails miserably. She appears to be without fault and has an answer for everything. At least Spencer admits to feet of clay. The plot was implausible.
0	Dumber & Dumber: Yeah, same wisecracking dialogue, sidekicks, and relationship quandaries as the Spenser novels.Realized the plot was familiar a few chapters in-- lifted from previous early Spencer novel.Characterizations inconsistent and contrived if not absurd-- a lot of villainous stereotypes-- and the plot point that the whole story is based on is ludicrous.There are much better written "guilty pleasures" than this one-- some by the same author.
1	Parker's new charge...: Being a huge Spenser fan I am of course a Robert B. Parker fan. Sunny Randall makes her debut in this yarn of sex, deceit and extortion. Not his best but getting his feet wet with this new female perspective, he makes more than a solid effort. (he gets the ball rolling in following tales) I'm grateful to Mr. Parker and his pen (figuratively???) If you are a fan...don't miss it. If you're not...WHY not???!!!!
1	Hard rock meets ambient: Listening to the song 'Alone' right now compels me to write this review. If nothing, buy this CD only for this track. A10-minute long epic ambient composition. Showcases the genius that Moby is. There are several other very good songs on this album. This album is predominantly hard/punk rock with some softer ambient pieces sparsed in between. Most people know Moby for his work on techno and ambient music, but here Moby shows his versatility by doing an equally good job with hard rock. Many of the songs have him screaming at the top of his voice, but rest assured, they are still good and not average hard/punk rock music. Again, Moby shows that he doesn't go by what sells. Rather he goes by his artistic instinct and likes to experiment with different genres of music.Most of Moby's works are highly underrated and misunderstood. This is one of them. Moby's music is intelligent music. Unfortunately, not many people can understand or appreciate that.
1	Awesome series.: The autumn series its just amazing,I first bought them in ebooks but it was so good thAt I had to buy the complete series in paperback.It's amazing how after so many books the author keeps you in suspense and doesn't get boring,this Moody guy it's really gifted.
0	GSM Phones: Alot of stuff for Nokia is GSM only. Pull off your battery, and take a look at your Nokia phone. The older phones that alot of people carry is TDMA/CDMA, like the 5185. Guess what? It dosen't work.
1	excellent reading: this is the best book i have ever read on jesus other than the bible. this man was very knowledgeable about his subject. he was also very familiar with his subject [jesus] as you will see when you read this book. no christian should be without this book in his library.
1	typos galore!: I do not intend to review content here. This new edition is so full of typographical errors that sometimes the reader will have to intuit what the author really wrote. It is clear that the proofreaders of this edition were not actually reading; they were simply following the little red lines under the "misspelled" words. This has resulted in some truly bizarre apparent statements by the author, unreproducible here due to copyright laws. Disclaimer-- I have not purchased this book, merely checked it out of the library.
0	Overrated: This book is overrated by a longshot. If I didn't know any better I could swear that this book wasn't even edited! Turtledove has 50 things going on at once! There are too many characters and too little continuity. I would recommend this book to anyone who has insomnia.
0	Very slow: Turtledove certainly has a good grasp of history but the quality of his writing is only so-so. When you combine this with a very long plot development and stereotypical characters it is almost impossible to finish one volume, let alone all four. An editor would have been useful but perhaps the publisher figured enough people would keep paying for the whole series that no editing was needed.
1	Fresh and exciting!: When I first heard the cd I was a bit shocked. These musicians really have a unique way of playing these pieces. I am quite used to period performances of romantic music but this feels really unique. The more I listen, I start to appreciate and understand the point in using the playing style that they do. I realize that this is very close to the way it ones sounded and that is very exciting I think. The lack of constant vibrato and the glissandos that are frequently used creates a completely new atmosphere which I think is very suitable for this music. I really recommend this disc and believe that the Eroica quartet has a bright future ahead of itself. And that what they do today...will shape the sound of tommorow!
1	Great for the beginner, the experienced, and the wanna-be: This is one of the few dog books I own that I would gladly spend money on again.I especially appreciate their section on selecting a dog specifically for the sport. Since most of us skijor with our pets, they make a point of emphasising what you want to live with 365 days a year. They also have a great section on training for races.My only hope is that they'll have a new edition out someday including training details for distance skijoring, which is bound to be a growing segment of the sport.
1	Great product!: I took a chance ordering this product, because there weren't many reviews. I'm glad I did! I got it a few days ago. Connecting my PC to my TV went fine (basicaly, my TV serves as a second PC monitor now), and after adjusting the screen resolution, the image was perfect. Very little fuzzyness. The quality of the videos I played was very good, and well transfered to the TV. The cables are not super long, something to think about if your PC and TV are far apart. A good choice, and I'll update in a few weeks/months to say how it holds up!
1	A Definite Page Turner!: This was an excellent story about World War II. Three friends who share quality time at Sakkara on an archeological expedition are seperated by the War. Harry Waever is in military intelligence for the United States. His other two friends,Jack Halder and Rachel Stern are at work for the Nazis. They are setting up a German plan to assasinate Roosevelt and Churchill in Egypt. It is up to Weaver to stop them. They are of course reunited. This excellent book has many surprises as well as manytwists and turns. The book will definitely leave you wondering what if? Be sure to read this book, you will not be dissapointed.
1	Enthralling: My son and I started reading parts of this in the car on a trip. We are both aficionados of anything mythological, and encountering these profound, rich, and unusual stories has been inspiring to both of us (but probably most inspiring to my son). The stories we have read so far are presented both as myths, but also as possibilities, expanding the idea of what might have been and what might be, offering also a window of insight into the times in which the myths were captured. The myths are largely framed within the context of the Christian and Roman Catholic Church and culture, and do reveal some of the bias of the times against the Jews and Judaic faith. While not politically correct, this is a solid well-written work with much education potential, if placed in context and not read as a sole work on the topic. One of the best free books I've gotten for the Kindle!
0	Great book; the worst print quality you'll ever seen: The book delivered by Amazon.com looks like a photocopied book, not a printed one. Paper quality is the worst. It's totally incompatible with the US$140 price.It should be out-of-print or something and then Prentice-Hall found it cheaper to photocopy and bind it, rather then issuing a new edition. Amazon.com should let customers know this in advance.The book content is great as the other reviewers have said, but I'm about to see a book with worse print quality than the one Amazon sent me.I wish I have bought a used book, printed15 years ago, for US$ 40.
0	Not good: I tried to read it, it was just so boring and bad. His other books are good, this book is not.
0	bad video: James Earl Jones butchers the narration of this 'live' presentation (he was far worse on the actual broadcast: this has been slightly edited!) and the actors portraying Clay Shaw and David Ferrie are horrible. This show was a classic example of the overkill that came after "JFK" came out in late1991---everything good, bad, and ugly came out in book and tv form...this is one of the ugly moments.Vince Palamara
0	Good packaging - no mushrooms :(: While this mushroom kit arrived in good packaging and looked ready to go, I was not able to get it to produce mushrooms. I followed the instructions keeping it moist and at the cooler temperatures, but nothing ever happened. I also tried oyster mushrooms a few weeks prior to that, and got huge crops of those, so I was disappointed that these didn't grow at all.
1	satisfying middle book of a fantasy/romance trilogy: Valeria is now accepted by the Riding School, where gods of patterns and time take the shape of white stallions and help determine the future of the Empire. But she and her teacher, First Rider Kerrec, both carry damage from their encounters with enemies of the Empire. Those same enemies, barbarians who follow the Unmaking (which would lead to the destruction of the world), threaten the Empire again. Can two damaged Riders, and the stallion gods who carry them, help the Empire win a deadly war?While this is the middle book of a trilogy, I preferred it to both the beginning and concluding books. I tend to be a reader of fantasy rather than romance, and I actually think that the romantic triangles/quadrangles in the other two books detracted from the plots of those books. They really felt sort of forced to me.
0	beware: First of all, this book isn't 344 pages as listed. It is only156. Secondly, this book only consists of english words and their chinese equivalents in simplified character form. NO pinyin and NO example sentences. This book would only be useful to Chinese people who want to translate english words directly into Chinese. This book is advertised as both english-chinese and chinese-english, however there is no chinese-english. I ordered this book before it was released and just received it. I am extremely disappointed. I repeat: NO Pinyin and NO example sentences.
0	Sometimes less is more!: I saw this film because I was such a fan of the orignal version. What a dissapointment. This film goes heavy on the gross-out and special effects because the story is weak and full of holes. The original was much scarier because of what you didn't see. The imagination is a powerful tool. We can imagine much worse that what we see. Just knowing the blob was somewhere, without actually seeing too much of it provided me with years of nightmares. I own the DVD of the original and watch it at least six or seven times a year. Matt Dillon was the flavor of the month when the remake came out. His performance was less than remarkable. An earlier review mentioned that Dillon was a much better choice of teen angst/rebellion than was Steve McQueen. Interesting, where the hell has Dillon been since this abortion of a film? McQueen is an icon and is still much more popular than Dillon. McQueen is also dead.
1	The Blob- Fear has no shape: This1988 version of The Blob is fantastic. I Love this movie so much, words cannot describe. Shawnee Smith, Kevin Dillion, Donovan Leitch, erika eleniak, candy clarke and the always georgeou Ricky Paull Goldin are all perfectly cast in their roles. The effects are great. I adore the music. Chuck Russell made the best movie. One of the best movies around.
0	A family saga that disappoints: I got this book because Ursula Hegi wrote an Oprah Winfrey pick "Stone From the River" some years ago and I remember enjoying that book.. While I love a good family saga, I cared nothing about any of the characters in this book. It was tedious, boring and repetitive. The premise of how an act in childhood affects members of several families for years to come seemed intriguing, but it was the only reason that held me to the end and then I realized that the book was actually a waste of time.
1	Excellent even for those without formal musical training: Excellent book. Does not assume any musical training, explains everything starting with the music notation. The exercises are truly gradual: each introduces only a few new hand positions, and future exercises reinforce hand positions introduced earlier. The early exercises are simple yet sound reasonably well not to be hopelessly boring, and one can hear when one plays them incorrectly. Great book for self-study. It was recommended to me independently by two very good classical guitar players; and my technique and sight-reading skills have improved notably since starting to use this book.
1	Another rocking Weeds Season.: Yet another awesome season of Weeds. A must have it you have the other 3 seasons.
1	Great series: A must have series. On the lines of Sherman Oaks if anyone actually saw it). Hats off too showtime. I only wish i could find the Sherman Oaks series on Amazon.
0	Kate Mulgrew before Voyager: "A Time for Miracles" is an underrated gem. Showing a bit of American history that is often neglected, and showing Kate Mulgrew as a determined woman who was strong willed, clever, not afraid of anyone, and was fond of coffee. No wonder she was cast as Katherine Janeway.
1	Endless Supply of Ink: The ink was inexpensive, considering how much ink it is. I think it will take me at least a year or two to use it all. I've been writing with the pen nonstop as my primary pen for 2 months and the first bottle isn't even noticiably lower on ink. Shipping was also fast and everthing arrived in good shape. Overall a great experience.
0	How To Write a Movie in 21 Days: I purchased and read this book because it was recommended by an author that has helped me develop in the screenwriting craft. But I didn't find it particularly helpful or practical. However, you might draw some inspiration from it.
1	This book makes anyone think he/she can write a screenplay with the inner movie method...: Wonderful intro...author clearly explains that if the readers want a more difficult route they can go with Syn Field's books, but this book will get you off and running & thinking about the task of screenwriting. For what the author intends to do, I give her 5stars.The Inner Movie Method is the start of your journey to writing a screenplay or to just understanding the movies you see better. It's concise, upbeat & "can do" in spirit.Accessible. Short Chapters. Exercises. Some good summaries. I like her overview of the stages of life & movie theme that concern each.A pleasure to read. Guaranteed to enhance your movie going experience.But again... this is a place to begin.
1	Sarah and O'Malley: Excellent description of these two characters; Sarah is an alien, but she is also a woman who is desired and connected to O'Malley. Neither character realizes just what is happening to them at first during the landing of Sarah's spacecraft. While she is saved by O'Malley and his crew she has already defended herself on the spacecraft from some of her enemies.(Also aliens) She is very near death when it crashes in the mountains near the VLA (very large array)in New Mexico. Both Sarah and O'Malley have led very colorful lives before this encounter--and both want out of that past life. This is a book that has to be read when you have the time to just do it, cause it was hard for me to put it down.
1	Out of the ashes: The Soka Gakkai was forged out of the rubble of postwar Japan. This is the story of how a small group with a generally poor and ill membership overcomes the harshness of the environment and forged a new chapter of Buddhism. For the critic above one simple question, has anyone who has criticized the SGI done anything to help humanistic causes all over the world? The only thing critics have to offer is silence.
1	A Great Summary of Labor Law: I am an ESL teacher with a background in law. A Colombian lawyer who had previously studied with me asked me to help her with the differences between our labor laws. This book was an excellent introduction to labor law. Anyone who needs a summary of this area will benefit from this book.TCB
0	Very disappointed!: Very disappointed with this item! First, when the knife arrived it obviously had been a return from someone else because the plastic was sliced open and the knife had been removed before. But, my son really wanted this for Christmas, so I kept it because I had not been able to find another one anywhere else. It was a Christmas present, and the leather sheath broke on Christmas Day after wearing it only about 5 hours! However, my son was very happy with the knife, so now we are trying to find another sheath for it.
0	Superficial: I found the content of the book very superficial. It deals with eliminating the symptoms of lack of motivation: things like "Kill your television", "Read yourself a story"... (these are chapters titles from the book). Do not expect a deep philosophical of psychological insight about human motivation or even human nature in general from this book.
1	Good video, Great Gift for new Parents: This video is an excellant video for new Moms and Dads, and in addition for anyone who will be helping with the newborn, to give Mom and Dad a break. The only drawback I found with the video was the length of the video. I wished it had gone into more detail , most specifically caring for the crying baby, and also, care of the baby up to 6 months. However, I can find no fault in this being a beginners tool for learning, and also, a refresher for us who have not taken care of an infant in many years. I purchased this video for first time parents. I wanted to watch it before giving it to make sure it would be something I would be glad to give as a present. I am glad and the parents were very happy to receive. See visually is great because reading is good but for those who are visual people, the instructions from this video will be more helpful. A great gift idea.
0	Did not fit BCM carry handle: Just as the title says. This mount did not seat properly or at all on my BCM milspec carry handle. i think these are hit or miss.
1	CCS Yellow Cutting Pad: Used with a Porter Cable buffer/vibrator, this yellow cutting pad along with a "cleaner" will take out buff marks and swirls. Finish off with a "white pad" and polish and then when waxed your car will look like it has a showroom finish.
1	WORTH IT!!!!: Once we finally rec'd the correct item ( orig order not from this company, so no reflection on them).....my husband loves it. He uses it for cold therapy only: his preference, not that it does not work well for that. So I can only tell you for cold therapy it rocks. I did not think it was cold enough for my lower back, but it is not sculpted for that. He loves its flexibility and states it is cold enough. He uses it for chronic neck pain. Just wraps it on his neck and goes to bed: it has a Velcro strap to keep it in place. Almost like having a neck pillow on, but not as bulky. FABU product!!!
0	Terrible Disappointment -- parts don't fit: My son (almost 8) and my husband (an engineer) sat down to put this together. Many of the holes were either drilled too small or, even worse, drilled in the WRONG PLACE. Some pieces are cut the wrong size and just don't fit!! What a terrible WASTE OF MONEY. There is no way to make it work without major drilling and sanding and then re-painting.My son is so disappointed -- he was really looking forward to putting this together.
1	Entertaining to the last page: Trollope is addictive, but some of his books offer more nonstop entertainment than others, and this is one of those.
0	Printer won't work now...: I have an HP Officejet 6210 and I figured I'd try this refill for my 94 ink cartridge. Filling it up was a pain because I had to hold the refill needly just barely into the created hole and let it drip in there slowly. My biggest problem was that after I refilled my cartridge, my printer would not let me use it anymore. I kept getting an error message that said "Please remove and check your black ink cartridge". I tried cleaning it, resetting the printer..tried everything to no avail. I contacted the manufacturer of the refill system and they rapidly sent me a new one, which I haven't tried. Now I need to buy a new ink cartridge for my printer to even operate! Very disappointed.
1	good: I enjoy having a cartridge ink quick at my disposal . The cost is very economical. I will buy again.
0	I was not pleased: I was having trouble finding a copy of this classic movie anywhere. I was eccited to see a copy on DVD Unfortunatley the word "COPY" is correct. It was a copy. The quality is good and the Menu looks good but the disc was definetly a copy. The case was also a copy. I am glad to have this in my collection nonetheless but was upset it was not original.
0	Trite, predictable tear jerker: Given the rave reviews of others, I expected an absorbing, thought provoking read. I found instead a book riddled with cliches, superficial character development and a predictable conclusion. Having just read Ian McEwan's Atonement, the contrast was dramatic. All That Matters would be a good fit for the condensed novel section of a traditional woman's magazine. All That Matters is to fiction what Rod McEuan(Listen to the Warm) is to poetry. Why do I feel that Jan Goldstein is hoping to cash in big with this one?
1	All That Matters: I thoroughly enjoyed both of Jan Goldsteins books. Both left me wanting more stories from him. Characters are alive and make you care about them almost immediately. I would recommend All That Matters to anyone and everyone.
0	Item Not Available: This item was out of stock, so I did not receive it. However, I received timely notification from Amazon.com.
1	Twilight Zone fans will love it: I really liked this one. It's been a long time since I've read any short story collection, and I'm glad I read this one. Actually didn't read it, I did this one on audio, there were different narrators for the stories lending different voices and all well done.Although the theme of hiring hit men was repeated in some of these stories, they all kept me guessing. Also since they were all with twist endings I anticipated what might happen but didn't often see what was coming.This is my first Jeffery Deaver book. I had avoided them since I HATED the movie of "Bone Collector" but I now want to read some more of his books; I'm hoping that Hollywood ruined a good writer's work.
1	Deaver's short stories are a joy: Jeffrey Deaver is a master at creating the twist ending that you never see coming, and these stories certainly showcase his talents. I had a wonderful time reading them and every time he surprised me with the twists - sometimes several twists in each story. I particularly was caught flat-footed by "Triangle" and "The Christmas Present" (which had one of those multi-twists I mentioned). Of course, as I said, I was surprised and delighted by each of the stories and I'm sure that anyone who is familiar with Mr. Deaver's work and/or who enjoys thrillers/suspense will enjoy the stories in this book. Characters range from Shakespeare (oh, yea!) to Deaver's iconic Lincoln Rhyme as well as a host of new characters to delight and entertain readers.And, of course, once you've finished this one you can go on and get the sequel,More Twisted: Collected Stories, Vol. II. Both books heartily endorsed by yours truly!
0	I want my [money] back!: I was the only one in my senior English class who loved the epic poem. Several years later I bought a copy of it at a comic book shop.For some reason, I liked Christopher Lambert, and I thought he would be a good actor for a movie based on this classic tale.Man, was I wrong!Aside from the names of the hero and one of the villians, this movie has almost nothing in common with the poem. It's got nothing in common with a good movie. It's a travesty!The acting, even with a so-called "top talent" like Christopher Lambert, is awful. The setting is almost non-existant, and the plot, ah yes, the plot ....I knew this movie would reek within the first10 minutes. I mean, I tried really hard to be open-minded, but it was to no avail.Spare yourself the pain and skip the movie. Settle in on a dark winter's night by a fire, put on some quiet music, and read the epic poem. You'll be glad you did.
0	It is a Lambert movie: Bad special effects. Lambert looked bored at times. The plot has a few holes. Too much cleavage. Bad fight scenes. Beowulf can do multiple black flips and spin in the air and yet the monsters can still hit him! The fact that Grendel's mother is pregnant doesn't really play into the movie, but they keep bringing it up. It is not the worst movie I have ever seen and I pretty much got what I expected so I'm not completely trashing it. The weapons were cool.
1	Inspiring and Soul-Searching!: Through a Narrow Gate is a testament to the personal struggle between feeling the faith and wanting to somehow live it, too. I am impressed with her ability to relive the experience while being fair to both sides and making their decisions and feelings make sense, even when they are directly opposing. The most remarkable thing is her feelings about the modern convents given her struggle and her respect for what was. Her respect is contagious - she gave it to me! She, and her experiences, seem to ratify my own even as mine pale against her story. I recommend it to anyone seriously trying to understand God in their own lives and in their own terms.
1	Through the Narrow Gate: Older book with new foreword. Personal discription of life in convent by well-known religious author.
0	too goofy and cheesy....: Since the book is one of the more expensive Luna line books, I just wanted to throw my two cents in to hopefully save you some of YOUR hard earned money since I already wasted mine on this book.What started out as quirky and light, quickly turned terribly cheesy, goofy,implausible and over the top cliche' with an almost nonexistent storyline about 80 pages in. It reads like teen fiction-and not in a good way. And yet again in the steadily disappointing Luna line-almost zero romance. Take my advice and skip this sad attempt.
0	Eggs stuck immediately: I bought this pan because Consumer Reports gave it such high marks. The very first time I used it, my egg whites stuck to it. I used a plastic spatula as recommended as well. I'll be getting my money back as it has a 60 day trial period.
1	Perfect!: We received this as a wedding gift. Three years later it looks like new! It cleans easily, cooks wonderfully, and has a great weight to it. I've never had a teflon pan last so long without any signs of wear or tear. This is probably the wedding gift we have used more than all others, and I couldn't be more satisfied.
1	A daughter of the Mennonites: Very good. READ until 5:00 AM and could not wait to finish the book today. Would recommend it to any age group.
0	Needlessly Repetitive to Make the Story More Interesting: This is the first Hillerman story I've read, so I understand that I'm missing a bunch of background on the Chee and Leaphorn characters and my overall enjoyment might be hindered. However, of the 350 pages or so of this book, at least 50 could be eliminated due to the repetitive writing. The same bits of story being told two or even three times for no apparent reason. I found myself wondering, again and again, if I had already gone over something only to realize that yes, I had!I am all for a story languidly and specifically unwinding toward its conclusion, as this one does. I think, however, that it needs to be done with some forward momentum and it needs to be able to maintain a certain level of interest for the reader. The writing here is weak and the story, not just obvious, is really just kind of boring.I am looking forward to trying out another title in Hillerman's canon with better results.
1	(Based on a) True Story: Hey readers out there. I just looked this book up because the November 24 edition of the Los Angeles Times ran the true amazing story of this incident. I guess now I'll have to read the book. When I do I'll come back with my review. You can get the LA Times on-line.
0	a great disappointment: The plug into the GPS 276c will not stay connected with the gps on a table or upright on the boat; where I planned on using the etrac. Both the a/c adapter and the car charger have the same attachment plug; I returned both to Amazon when I returned from Central America.
0	Cibo Matto has made an incredibly boring album: Having heard the decent track by Cibo Matto "Sci-fi Wasabi" on a CMJ sampler, I bought STEREOTYPE A thinking it might have other songs in the same vein. Much to my dismay, it honestly is a boring album. Nearly the songs sound the same, and the singing of Miho Hatori and Yuka Honda is inept and lazy.Cibo Matto, like several other Japanese artists (most notably Towa Tei), tried to use the American fascination with seemingly alien culture to sell this album. In the end, all one gets is a collection of14 yawn-inducing filler-pop tracks. It has no redeeming qualities, and I would recommend that people would find much more worthy music to spend their money on.
0	You've got to be kidding!: Why would they release such a complete mess like SciFi Wasabi as a single?...completely turns me away from wanting to hear the rest. Musically and lyrically a disaster. I'd rather sit through karaoke night at the local drinking dive.
1	Better Than the First: But not as revolutionary as the first album "Viva La Woman." I bought this CD being told it was like the Beastie Boys were women. That was a lie; but Cibo Matto is crazy like the Beastie Boys. Their music is sometimes Electronica, sometimes Alternative, sometimes just plain weird. The weird part makes sense because Shaun Lennon has an influence of this band. One track reminded me of John Lennon's Revolution 9 in that both still give me nightmares. Number 9, number 9...
1	Excellent Movies: I saw Mission Impossible I when it first came out in theaters, and did not watch it again until I bought this double disk set. I enjoyed it just as much if not more than it's incredible sequel. Both movies together, even though they are very loosely related, add up to a great buy.
0	Rust problems: This is a great kettle with one serious flaw. My kettle has started rusting inside the spout after1 year. There is a lip where the spout joins the base and water is caught there after use.
1	A delicious spiritual journey.: For all those who have been, are, or are going to embark on a spiritual shopping spree, Mick Browns "A Spiritual Tourist" is a delicious rendering of one journalists journey. He remains scheptical and distanced from his subject matter throughout. Though on the odd occasion he cannot help but get involved and be affected by the people he meets. From the appearence of "verbati" in London, to joining the throngs that sit at the feet of Si Baba, (though I did find this chapter long winded) to a meeting with the Dali Lama and the Theosophical society, to crosses appearing on the windows of a church in the United States and his final chapter, which I perticularly enjoyed, being a visit to a Buddist centre in England, his journey is informative, honest and inspiring. I thouroughly enjoyed every minuite and found many of his conclusions enlightening.
0	Raises good questions, but was it edited?: Was this book edited? I think the publisher should be ashamed. If you can slog through the grammatical errors, typos and generally poor writing, you might find this book interesting. However, given that it appears to have been unedited, and given that folks in-the-know have pointed out technical inaccuracies to me, I wouldn't take anything written in this book as the gospel truth. It did raise some interesting questions that I will research.I will think twice before buying a book from this publisher again.
1	ellery queen mysteriesa: This was a very different type of book from what i'm usesd to. It was very goog.I am a big fan of ellery queen.
1	A very nice shoe: I bought this more for fashion than function, but it has both. It is a very comfortable shoe, and very durable. It is also really nice looking.
1	Great running shoe but why is price way up?: The double-edged sword of rating a product highly: you help out fellow shoppers but then the vendor raises the price. I bought this exact shoe1-1/2 yrs ago for $45 w/free Super-Saver shipping. Now the shoe costs $73 + shipping? Maybe we should all keep our mouths shut. And what's w/the different pricing for different sizing? Sounds like discrimination to me. Could be a federal offense.I've given it 5 stars to see how much higher the price rises.
1	A classic: It was just as good as I remembered! The grand kids (2&4) sat mesmerized for the entire movie! Ttkhanks for the nice afternoon!
1	So sweet!: Kept my 2 year old interested which is hard to do!!! The ending is. Little weird bc it feels lime something is missing but cute movie overall!
0	Forced previews: The movie is fine, but the DVD has previews of other movies that cannot be skipped over. Please don't pay money to support this practice. If you pay for the movie, you shouldn't have to pay again by watching ads.
1	A perfect film: "Babe" comes the closest to being a perfect film out of anything I've seen. Everything in the film should be there, and nothing seems to be missing -- the funny touches with the mice, the love between Babe and Farmer Hogget, the themes on family and self-identity -- any adult or child can watch this movie and love it.
0	Not Good At All: This is the WORST movie I have EVER seen. We had to see it in our class one day. The teacher said that I HAD to watch. Reluctantly, I sat down. I hated it. She fast forwarded it to the middle so we could see the end. Even that part was bad, and I didn't see all of it! I'd give it -10 stars for horrible scenes, cruelty to animals, and lack of trying. DON'T SEE IT EVER!!!
1	No Skip-Ahead function on this DVD: BABE is a wonderful movie, but this DVD does not allow the viewer to skip thru the previews. Once the movie begins you can skip around, but you have to sit thru a bunch of previews EVERY TIME your kid watches this movie.
1	Dundee II: Very good sequel. Moderate amount of action & an actual plot unlike many new movies. If you own the first this is a definite addition to your video home library
0	Non-stick Coating Wore Off and is Chipping After Three Months: I bought this pan with high expectations given the strong reviews from other customers but after a few months of use I am very disappointed. The pan takes several coats of oil to prevent food from sticking and now the non-stick surface is beginning to flake off. I always washed the pan by hand and never used anything other than plastic cooking utensils. The last non-stick pan I had was Kirkland brand and it lasted four years.
1	Oldie and Goodie: My father got me hooked on these books. They are extremely well written and just fun to read. Anyone who just wants a good mystery without all the sex and swearing will love these books.
1	Excellent stuff!: This face wash is great, it's light, foaming, and again, in the first 24 hours of using the exuviance products, there is a noticeable difference in my skin texture and overall look. It's amazing! My Proactive is going away, and I'm all over this stuff now.
0	Worse than surgery: The jokes in this book are not only unfunny, they are not worthy of actually being called jokes. I have flipped through many of the pages in search of a good laugh and haven't found anything remotely close. I rarely post reviews. Out of curiosity I looked up this book on Amazon and saw someone posted 5 stars.This person is clinically insane.I am _that_ driven to post just to bring the average rating down. You will get more laughs with your seven dollars by renting Les Miserables.
1	Amazing but not his best: This is Jimi's most famous performance, maybe since its included in the most famous concert ever. Still, there are better concerts of Jimi than this one. It takes him and the band almost all of disc one to warm up. On Red house, Larry Lee plays the lead guitar, so believe me, any other live version of Red House is better than this one. But just as the concert is near its end, Jimi starts playing Star Splanged banner and makes everything worthwile. This is one of rock most memorable moments, one of those that youll have stuck in your mind no matter what, like Elvis playing Ed Sullivan, or the Beatles coming to America. So, from that track till the end of CD2 youll hear nothing but some of the best music ever recorded. Now, if you can get the Monterrey CD on a second hand shop, that is Jimi's best performance ever. Or get Band of gipsys instead.
0	poor: The product did not operate as stated on the box. The supplier CDROMUSA wasn't at all helpful and left me with a product I'm unable to use; so they got FREE money and refused to send a replacement.They don't deserve a star at all, but the one star represents the nice, deceptive packaging.
1	movies that make you THINK: How many times in our lives have we wanted a "do over" in our lives thinking if we could just "change" one of our actions things would have been so much better in our present day lives. These movies make you realize, life can never be perfect no matter how many times you could try!
0	Overpriced and too many restrictions on use: This item is very overpriced. I ordered it because I wanted the very best, and I thought I would get what I paid for, but it is no different than other pans a half the price. Also, the information sheet that accompanied the pan had so many restrictions and warranty cop-outs that if followed would make the pan almost unusable.
1	My recommended buy: Had bought a set of the Anolon Advanced Hard Anodized Nonstick cookware, but it did not include a 2 qt. covered Saucepan.This size is something I use a lot. I love the lighter weight than the14 yr. old set we had. The rubberized handle and lid are great.I love the glass lid and the nonstick finish is great! Clean-up is very easy. I don't use high heat as directed, but do boil in the saucepanwithout any damage being noted. I highly recommend this size pan and the whole set. It is less expensive than some of the more popularbrands, but I like the look and function better. I am a very satisfied customer.
0	Not good at all!: This book actually pokes on Henry's contemporaries and describes series of events which will eventaully lead to a horrendous headache to be suffered by the reader. On the other hand, Fielding's Tom Jones is a delight and mustn't be missed at any cost! This book is a total waste, though!
0	A Disappointment: I've long been a fan of Robert B. Parker Spenser books but, even though I watched them, I didn't really care much for the Robert Urich "Spenser for Hire" series. Too 'goody two-shoes' and 'television-ized.' That's why, when I found these Joe Mantegna movies, I enthusiastically thought that someone made some Spenser movies that were a little more 'raw' and true to the books. What a disappointment! The stories were accurate enough, but Joe Mantegna as Spenser? A former cop and boxer? I don't THINK so! I found him, and the actors filling the roles of Hawk and Susan to be completely unbelievable and wrong for the parts. These movies really made me MISS the Robert Urich series!
1	The Power of the Witch: I loved this book. It's very informitive. I like the fact that my friend, who is very far from being pagan, read it and understood it. It does exactly what the man behind the counter told me it would do. TEACH. I even email Laurie and told her how much I loved it.
0	Not Impressed by Cabot: I expected great things from Cabot's books. I was let down. I did not care for her writing style, nor did I find her information moving or educational. I am genuinely surprised that so many people find Cabot to be a literary value. I just don't see it. I would not recommend Cabot's works to anyone interested in paganism or witchcraft.
0	A guide to one-night stands: This book is confusing and difficult to follow because the author tries to cover one-night-stands and polygynous dating with the same advice. Basically, you will probably get laid using these tips, but the type of woman you will reel in may not be the type you'd want to see again... ever.For example, what do you think happens when you use money as an incentive to control womens' behavior? She is going to use sex in a similar fashion to control you. Unless she's an idiot. But hey, if you read this book with the goal of getting laid, you're probably into that.
0	Not entirely original...: Actually everything in the book IS helpful, and a OK read... but most of the material is FREE on the net already.The stuff from "The Layguide" was mirrored on all kinds of websites all over the place before it ever became print. If you search for keywords like "layguide" and "player guide" on the net, you will find this stuff is basically plagaurized. It was just a compilation of a bunch of usenet posts.Now, if you really want something in print, and original too, do yourself a favor now and go buy "The Art of Seduction" by Robert Greene, also available here on Amazon.com. The guy researched great seducers and seductions throughout history, and came up with types of seducers, the stages of seduction, etc. And his work is entirely original as well.
0	Some reasonable advice.: I like the book but its a bit over the top in places.There is some good advice and if used sensibly is okay.Its a good book.I recommend these,also available from this site:1)"U.S.S."(Undercover Sex signals")By Leil Lowndes.2)"How to pick up girls!" By Eric Weber.3)"How to meet the right woman" By Roger Ratcliff,David Conaway & Diana Ohlsson.4)"How to pick up(get dates with)beautiful women:secrets every man should know".By John Eagan,B.A.5)"Understanding women:The definitive guide to meeting,dating and dumping,if necessary.By Romy Miller.
0	Read The Art of Seduction instead: This is amateur stuff. If you want to get really useful and ground-breaking stuff, read The Art of Seduction:[...]I know that it's long and a bit academic in tone, but it is the last word on Seduction in the modern age. True seduction is not just a one-shot, get-laid-tonight approach (although it can certainly include that). Read The Art of Seduction, and you will be well on your way to having women desire you to a degree that is truly shocking. I am a true believer, and I owe the author Robert Greene a debt that cannot be repaid. It is mind-boggling how much women really want to be carried away by their desire. Arm yourself with an understanding based on Greene's book, and you'll be well on your way.
0	For anyone else, 4 stars. For Laura, it's her nadir.: Wishywashy cause-proclamation from a once brilliant tunesmith and vocalist. It's okay to buy into feminism, tree-hugging and wicca in one's personal life, but to create an album on a major label about this stuff, to slow and barely tuneful music is a major mistake. If you're unfamiliar with Laura Nyro, this is not the place to begin. Try "Eli and the Thirteenth Confession," "The First Songs" or pretty much anything else. Leave this one for Gloria Steinem or the next PETA convention.
0	One of the worst spokeseman for my party..: Let this illogical hack please not defend my party, and makea case against the liberals. She doesn't get it, and makesso many ridiculous arguments that don't hold up.Her writing style is horrendous. Please do not wastetime on this book. I would give this rating a negative 2 starsif I could.
1	better than the swiffer: I love the simplee clean microfiber swivel mop. It is bigger and easier to use than the swiffer and you don't have to keep buying replacement sheets...just wash and go. A much more environmental and financial choice than other cleaning options.
1	My floors are always cleaned with a CLEAN mop now!: I do think this item works great as a mop and as a dust mop, it really picks up all of the hair, fuzz and dust. Sadly(this is why it isn't 5 stars), corners and edges will find you using a regular broom, instead of this gadget, as it just can't handle those areas. I love that I can throw the pads in the washer and let them air dry -- no more mopping with anything less than clean.
0	Depends on your situation: I bought this along with the authors' grammar reference, which has proven an expensive mistake. The two are college level texts and probably quite good for those engaged in intellectual pursuits. I, on the other hand, teach ESL as a volunteer and was simply looking to shore up my practical knowledge of the subjects. Both texts contain virtually no such information. In fact, they assume a significant knowledge of linguistics and linguistic theory; they are literally packed with obscure jargon that I presume familiar to some set of initiates but certainly far beyond my ken. If your situation is analogous to mine, I suggest Side by Side Spanish & English Grammar and Practice Makes Perfect English Pronouns and Prepositions--much less expensive ($30 the pair I think) and much more practical.
1	Does a good job: Mach3 does a fine shaving job, and it's better than the cheap razors you find at the supermarket. They're durable (although not as much as I'd like). I believe that Mach3 cartridges are more widely available than Schick Quatro cartridges, and that the 4 blades were overkill (let's wait for the 7-blade razor to see how that works)Also with Amazon's Subscribe & Save feature, they arrive at my door with discount and I never run out of them. Nice!
1	Works just fine, but not cheap at all: I get 4-5 shaves with each razor, after that it causes pimples. I find it too expensive, but there is no better alternative.
0	Horrible Shaving System: I purchased the razor and blades as the double-bladed sensor was out of stock. This is the worst design Gillette has yet put forth. The 3-blade design is much too wide and clumsy. The only shaving done with this razor system was my first layer of skin.
0	Mach3 or crap3: Very poor quality, blade feels blunt and scrapes rather than cuts..I used a whole pack of 8 in1 week, each blade was only good for1 shave. Dont waste your money
0	Somehow not as good as Birks: They run MUCH smaller than Birkenstocks. I sent the size 44 back (which is comfy in the comparable model in Birkenstocks; is it the Boston?) and got the 45 and it STILL feels small. The upper is ok, the shoe isn't the best made thing but is adequate; it's just the size thing that bothered me.
1	Very Nice!: My wife and I go on vacation only once a year but this is perfect for the beach. It's also nice to walk on the board walk or in surf shops.
1	good piece of collection: This video reflects the early years of Pink Floyd. In that time a bunch of innovative guys, mainly Syd probably because his use of sychedelic stuff, trying to bring something new in terms of music. If you are a real fan this would be very rare and interesting but if you expect the late sound of PF with Waters and Gilmour maybe you will feel quite shocked. I rated it 4 because is a short document and the sound is not the best although for this kind of information this is not important, the real value of the video is to see them in the context of a very important moment in the history of pop music.
0	Garbage!!!: I'll keep it short and sweet. This product is garbage. I purchased a vinyl cover to further protect the item, but it became a rust bucket and fell to pieces. The company's response: we'll send you $50. Nice. Don't waste your time & money. Keep looking.
1	Superb Short Stories!: This book is a delightful surprise, with a wide range of well-crafted short stories sure to entertain any fan of the genre.A few of them resonate with the reader long after the book's finished, particularly a tale involving the history of a backwoods baptismal pool, and a married couple's slow and sweet farewell after the wife is diagnosed with a terminal illness. I'll read them again after a year or two- the ultimate compliment to a short story collection!
0	Update of the old book: It was a rather frustrating book since it was just an update of the previous generation book for VC++ 6.0. It seems that SAMS wanted to be the first to sell in order to sell. This is rather bad for the company since it will lose many of its potential customers in the future. The only chapters worth reading, well at least a little bit, are chapters19 and 21 and nothing more.
0	Clapton masterpices: I'm a big fan of Eric Clapton and his music dating from the Yardbirds forward. He's done a tremendous body of work. Unfortunately you won't find much here worth buying. The overall content and quality are pretty poor. Rather than masterpieces this more like the stuff left (for good reason) out of many other DVD's covering his work.
1	Long Walk to Freedom: Ever since their emergence on Paul Simon's Graceland, the unique harmonies and rhythms have kept me enthtralled. The notable thing about this CD is how their famous guests adapt to their sound, choice of material, and blend is solid. Some collaborations work better than others. Mellissa Ethridge and Natalie Merchant are two standouts. This a worthwhile introduction this group.
0	slow moving, pretentious and out of date: If you are a fan of apocalyptic fiction, there are many better books to read than this. While I did finish it, i found it slow moving (very slow), Pretentious in language, and very out of date in the effects of war. I think the real message was about the value of civil defense. An interesting point, but the author, writing in the mid-50's was talking about efftects of atomic bombings that are much milder than true. Totally unrealistic.
1	A very beautiful coffee table book...: I love the book...couldn't be more pleased with everything! I know I'll treasure this book for the rest of my life and will share it with my friends and family...because it will live on the coffee table in my sunroom for everyone to see!
1	worth the wait: It's great to finally see this album released on CD. I've wanted this for a long time. Hot on the heels of the "Biggest Prize in Sport" album, this was released by Polydor in the USA clearly with the idea of riding the cresting new wave. Sure, it was probably 999's most "commercial" album but listeners are treated to some great catchy hard rockin' songs. No, it's not punk but these guys never were really prime safety pin disciples. A very consistent album. Sing along! And what a great live band they were!
0	Not as expected: Unfortunately the bouncing mechanism is not strong enough to bounce the baby's entire body. When my 9 lb. baby was in there only her feet were bouncing. It did not create the same feeling that she gets when I bounce a "regular" bouncer with my foot. A huge disappointment! I returned it.
1	Great Book on the Best Computer: This is a great book on the inventor of the Apple Computer. I have read it several times and done a couple of book reports on it. I highly recommend it.
0	Make sure product is for your GPS: I recommend the product if it is for your specific GPS!I purchased a Garmin GPS 76CSX, and Amazon said people who buy this product also buy, and all the also buys were for different model GPS's and did not work with that unite, so be careful when ordering.
0	Garmin 276C Power Cord: The powercord sent was a straight connection rather than the 90 degree one and would not stay plugged in to the unit. I wish I would of tried it before cutting and soldering to my motorcycle connection. Tis junk and can't use it. Money wasted.
0	THE CABLE IS DIFERENT TO THE PHOTO: THE CABLE IT'S NO SAME TO THE PHOTO, DO NOT HAVE A TERMINAL CIGARETTE CONNECTOR, I LOST MY MONEY. I think you wrong the part, I receive Part No. RB, have a wiring diagram for make a Gilsson RB cable for install a DB-9 serial connector, but no, I buy to you other cable whit12 volt adapter cable.
1	Great gift Idea--they love it!: I bought this for my grandson who loves NCIS. He was so tickled. He is collecting the series.
1	another good season for an already great show: this is a solid season with several great episodes. the characterization is some of the best. it's not quite the same as we've lost Kate and gained Ziva, but the dynamics and chemistry really develop well. if you like season1 and 2 you'll like 3 as well.
1	3rd season of NCIS: This was a interesting season for the show. Everytime you watch the show you learn and see something different.
0	Very disappointed: The NCIS movie i ordered came in in a timely manner. It was in the condition stated at the time of purchase. These are the things i am very pleased with. Not having watched this series on tv as we do not have cable or an atenna in our home i was unaware of the skanky nature of this season. The intellegence and absence of immorality that i have seen on the few episodes i watched outside the home caused me to purchase. I am extremely disappointed in this episode and the following one. The rounchyness far out weighed the intellegence by far. Now i am very very leary about purchasing any other episodes. I did enjoyed episode one which i borrowed from my neice. The moral deploriaty is why we do not have cable or an atenna in our house. These have gone to the trash as is fitting for such lack of marality.
1	Season 3 is great!: Continuing right where Season 2 left off with the murder of Agent Todd, the team adds 2 new members to their cast. The new director is named Jenny and has a previous relationship with Gibbs and the new agent is named Ziva.
1	A feast for the ears: I have had this album, yes the hard vynl thing, since1981. Now we can get these great works of art right on our pcs. My favorite as always been Bouree. I think this is one of the neatest pieces ever written. I love the images it invokes. Strap those head phones on and be transported into the romance of dancers in veils and moonlit desert nights.
1	Law: Gives a great overall view of this modern type career for both men and women. Provides the nuts and bolts of the career.
0	Terribly Dissappointed: I had watched this version when I first got it but must have missed the missing Coral Sea parts for some reason. It jumps from the scene where Rochfort has told Garth about Operation AF (Coral Sea) to where they are telling Rochfort that they had a rough time at the battle!Some really great scenes are missing in this verison. Hope that they release a full version sometime soon. Its a shame that this movie was so downgraded from the original.Bottom line: dont waste your money. Wait, wait, wait for them to put out the Full "Real" Collector's Edition.I note that the "added for TV" scenes seem to be more personal and probably added for the ladies but weren't they in the theater version too? I seem to remember seeing the scene with Garth and his girlfriend talking at their apartment before he leaves in theater. Perhaps age is starting to show ... in me! :)
1	Great flick: I took my father to see this movie in theaters back when it was released in the 70's. He was a Marine who served in the Pacific and told ne how important this battle was. I needed to have it in my collection.
1	Close...: This is a close fictionalized movie of the beginning of WWII. It is interesting and a great flick to share.
0	terrible: Continues to freeze movie and my TV . Will not purchase streaming movies again. Useless .suggest no one get this .
1	Great flick: Good movie, one of a very few on the battle of Midway. The additional storyline a Japanese love interest was distracting, however.
0	Profanity Galore - This is not the TV Version: If you loved watching this on TV as a child you will be surprised at the language in this version. If you are sensitive to profanity - don't get it.
1	Midway: I have never received this item. It was first mis-delivered (not to me) and never arrived. Now, it has not been sent.As for the movie, I've seen it more than once. It's a great movie. Just wish I could get it delivered. Can you help me out?
1	Midway: Very well done. Both on the part of the Japanese war plans, as well as our own. I lived in that era and remember the situation very well. I would recommend this movie to all aages.
0	Poorest war movie ever made: 'Midway' on DVD while we're still waiting for 'The Longest Day'- somebody's got to be kidding. This one really sucks. Here we go: stock-shots ripped off from 'Thirty seconds over Tokyo', 'Tora Tora Tora' and probably other movies, WWII newsreels footage extensively cropped to fit into the Panavision frame, meaningless cameos by various aging stars -probably to make the flick look like a blockbuster- , historical mistakes and countless errors about planes and aircraft carriers, inept dramatization -the predictable romance between Heston's son and a Japanese girl-, you name it. The only reason I give this awful turkey one star is because the software doesn't allow me to give it none.
1	A classic war film. Very underated.: People complain about how this film uses some of the same historic footage "Tora Tora Tora" uses. This WWII footage is great and should be used in different war films. Just because it was used in that film dosent mean it can't be used in "Midway". It's not like they took scenes made for "Tora Tora Tora" and put them in this film. Historic footage is used and reused in many films. How many times have we seen scenes with President Kennedy in different films? The same populer footage of him? This film is an epic war masterpiece. The acting is superb. People complain about the Japanese speaking English. You are supposed to imagine them to be speaking Japanese. It's not like a mistake the film makers made that makes the film appear cheaper or something. This film gets very little credit, and is always in the shadow of "Tora Tora Tora". I think, if you collect war films, you should own both. "Midway" is a true classic.
0	I had a great expectation for this...: What would you get if you took a bad script, uninspired acting, WW2 stock footage, scenes from Tora! Tora! Tora!, and put it in a blender and mixed it around? The answer: Midway! This reeaallly bad movie suffers from everything. WW2 stock footage is over-used (most of it didn't even take place during the battle of Midway) and the scenes from Tora! Tora! Tora! are out of place. A corny love interest gets in the way of the action too much. Lot's of familiar faces in this, but their acting is uninspired, and the script is dreadful. About 30 minutes of important footage was cut out of the original release (including the battle of the Coral Sea). Please, avoid this film!
1	the best: its the best music i have heard in some time. if you are in to world music or just looking for some thing diferent , well it does not get much better then this.
1	Intense, vibrant: Pure hardcore party vibes here,..with infectuous spirits that can intoxicate. Rockin' tunes include "Legalize it"' "Downpressor Man" and a fantastic "Get Up, Stand Up." Hard and fat bass lines, solid drumming and vocal chants work to induce a tribal fever and a mood to celebrate life.
0	Like being at a drive in...: The film played on countless "dusk till dawn" horror bills at drive-ins through the early 80's, and this disc does a pretty good job of taking th viewer back to those long gone days of cheap thrills. The picture and sound quality are only about average, just like the drive-in, the only other thing you need is for someone to park their car outside you living room and honk thier horns during the nude scenes. And the movie? Well it's about average as well. The plot concerns a plot to get an inheritance and a bunch of greedy heirs. A true B movie on all counts, but not without a certain trashy value, those who spent warm summer nights watching this flick when it was paired up with the likes of "Don't Answer the Phone," and "Point of Terror" may want to give this reasonably priced disc a look.
1	Excellent Look into African American History: I just completed this novel and I must say that it was excellent. It was quite obvious that the author had done extensive research into her subject matter. It was a poignant look into history and how African American women had to struggle in a world where they were often looked upon as inferior. Everything from the descriptions to dialogue was well-written and I look forward to reading more of Ms. Singleton's work.
0	n/a: Who is Joe Nickell? What are his qualifications for these research endeavors and the knowledge to properly assess all parameters involved in scientific research?
0	Set of 2 40" Hardwood Datio Bokken Practice Sword: I bought these for myself and my son for Aikido weapons training. They are not very well made and appear to have been factory seconds. To clarify there are cracks in both to point that they might easily break and splinter. One is practically straight with no curve. The handles are nicely wrapped but the wrapping tends to come off with use. There is also removable plastic guard or tsuba, which is not very functional and more decorative. You get what you pay for and these are not high quality, hence the expensive price. I will eventually buy something better.
0	Cheap, and it shows.: I got these as a gift for a friend, so that we may have some fun sparring. However, one sword came with a large crease in the wood that proved to break open after only a couple hours of use. They also had a strange, chemical-y smell to them for quite a while.They can still be good display pieces, but I would recommend getting synthetic swords if you plan on seriously using them; the extra cost is worth their durability.
1	Christmas present: Love these practice swords I have purchased some before and my son just plain wore them out. These are for Christmas and I already know he will love them...
1	Victum Of Sinility: Ironically, while doing an update to the catalog of my movie library, I ran across this one and decided to watch it this evening - having no recollection of it. I see that it has great review ratings from other owners, and their details I will leave to you to peruse.This is a great mystery drama. Don't miss it.Regards,EdB
1	Justifiable Revenge: I Think that Camille Keaton handled the attack with as much diginity as she could muster up, what she does afterward to each of them is well deserved.Rape and nude scenes so please beware, this 8o's film was raw and has become a true classic in the vein of Charles Bronson's10 to midnight. This is a classic, get it while you can.
1	A classic of its kind: This movie is a classic of its kind and much better that a lot of movies, that followed. It is not one of the best, but it still deserves five stars...
0	WATCH A WOMAN GET RAPED, BEAT, & TERRORIZED. OH HOW FUN...: I watched this when I was a young girl & it still haunts me to this day. If you enjoy watching a woman get viciously raped for almost an hour then this is the movie for you.
0	Based On A True Story?: Based on a true story? If this is true then it is more horrible than being a fictional fantasy. Did anyone witness this woman being raped? People are just going on a murder's word that she was rape by these men. They didn't have the DNA Test back then and when it did come about a lot of women were found guilty of lying about being raped.Since when is it all right for anyone to take the law into their own hands? I guess it was1978 when it started for women or maybe before. You would never say it was okay for a man to murder a woman no matter what she did to him. This is sexist and sick.
0	0 STARS: Talk about rubbish...you want to talk about rubbish?: Be honest people, this is not a horror movie or a scary movie...this is just pure garbage. What cinematic value does this movie have to offer? ZERO. I am all for horror movies, but this movie just is not horror, scary or even shocking...it's just lame! It is about the raping of a girl and she gets revenge. WOW, what a worthless...waste.
0	Has live grain bugs: I received my order a couple of weeks ago. The shipment has live bugs -- Sawtooth Grain Beetles. I have had to move the bag from my pantry to the garage. I have sealed it and placed it in a closed can but still not sure how to kill them without contaminating the seeds. Usually I place a bay leaf on the top of any grain to keep bugs out. This bag was received with live bugs already in the shipment. The seeds sprout okay after rinsing them so they deserve at least one star.
1	The Book of Vodou: Charms and Rituals to Empower Your Life: For such a little book, it is quite informative.I bought a copy when it was first published around10 years ago & found myself reading & referring to it many many times. I've had an interest in Vodou for many years & like some that didn't grow up in Haiti or anyplace where Vodou is present, "The Book Of Vodou" is a great introduction.This book's is a very appealing glimpse into a beautiful religion that is often misunderstood. It has great photographs throughout & is straight & to the point about the origins & history of Vodou from West Africa all the way up to the present day without information overload.I have been a practioner of "The Arts" for many years, as well as a historian & there's not one negative thing I can say about this book. It's one of my favourite books on Vodou & in fact, I'm on my fourth copy!If you any interest in Vodou, start with this book! You will not be disappointed.
0	Discover a beautiful region of France: If you want to discover a beautiful and wild French region through the eyes of a Scottish writer, read Travels with a donkey. Stevenson, before he became famous, depicted his journey in the cevennes, with his donkey "Modestine". Rediscover the excellent style of a young writer about to become world-wide-known.
1	Awesome: I had a lot of trouble finding this C D. I look over the internet for couple of hours until I came upon Amazon. Not only did I find what I was looking for, but bought the C D for a price I did not think could possible. Thanks! Love this Awesome C D.
1	LOve it!: I have really curly, thich & frizzy hair. I found this product @ a local beauty supply store and LOVE it!!! I now have soft, flowing, shiny, beautiful curls. I used to need mousse, curl enhancers and tons of products to wear my curls. Since I started using this product I can just spray some leave in conditioner and I am good to walk out the door :) I usually apply it 2-3x's a wk over night and just rinse out in the morn (no shampoo).
0	disappointed: i loved the original poster i lost due to a move, i decieded to replace it and ordered this poster but when i recieved it it was NOT black and white but black and blue.
0	Not a Great Book: I was a little surprised by the content of this book. It is really not a book I would recommend. It is about a Grandma who takes her grandkid to the beach and nothing goes right. Then it ends. I thought it could have been more meaningful.
1	Finally, I can style my own hair!: I've read many reviews on this site -- some negative, some positive. I have A LOT of hair. My hair is full of texture. My hair doesn't grow down (length), it grows out (wide.) I WOULD NEVER USE A HAIR DRYER BEFORE! I couldn't unless I wanted to look like a clown. This product is the first product that allows me to dry my hair. The product does get very hot! That is what my hair needs to become straight and manageable, however. If you don't have frizzy and unruly hair, this is product was NOT made for you. I, however, must say FINALLY!!
0	Infiniti by Conair BC173: I have shoulder length curly, fine hair. I followed the directions for use and I ended up with a messy head of frizzy hair. The brush does more blowing than straightening in my opinion - it is fine for drying hair. But I did not get the sleek, smooth, shiny effect that was promised by the straightening tool. It was nothing like the salon straightening job I normally get. I will be returning this styler ASAP. Very unhappy.
0	Twice the effort for half the sleekness: My hair is about 90% straight and10% wavy, so you wouldn't think it takes much to make it sleek, straight and shiny; I even use an ant-firzz serum before I style. But using this Conair took twice as long as drying and straightening my hair in two steps, and gave me half as straight hair. I even used my regular blow dryer first to get most of the dampness out, thinking this would speed up the process...but no, it took ages. The Conair is basically a very small hairdryer with a few brush bristles. When I was finished, my hair definitely had frizz and fly aways, and I had to go back over it with my Chi flat iron. I really wanted to like this product and to save time, but I will be returning it.
0	not worth it: If you have never used a flat iron before, don't even bother.This product does not come even close to the results I get when i use my flat iron. A waste of money, to say the least.
1	Works well for thick hair if you have the time...: I have really thick shoulder length hair. I only wash my hair twice a week and once my hair is dry and straightened, I don't need to do a thing with it. This product works really well for me as long as I have the time to spare. I takes me at least 30 or 40 minutes to dry and straighten my hair once it has been towel dried. I bought this product because I didn't want to spend the money for more expensive similar items. I think that for the price....the infiniti is well worth it.
1	Conair Straightener: I have very thick, very wavy hair. Thie straightener works well on my hair. It is easy to use. It also does not take a week to get my hair dried. I cut my hair to shoulder length and found it does work better than on long hair, although I did get it to work on my long hair too. I am very pleased with this product. I definately recommend it.
0	Does not perform the functions advertised.: This hair dryer claims to style, smooth and streighten. Don't count on it. I have medium lenghth fine hair and I wish I never bought it. However, it might work on longer hair? Not a high probability. Forget this product and empty promises.
0	Stopped working after second use: The dryer worked fine but I only use a hair dryer occasionally so I'd only used it twice in 6 weeks. When I went to use it the third time, it was deader than a doornail. No power. I guess the stress of sitting in the cabinet for a few weeks was too much for it. Too late to return it. I've seen other reviews with a similar problem so it seems they have some quality control issues to work out and if you buy one, it's the luck of the draw if you get a 'good' one or not. I'm generally very pleased with my purchases through Amazon...but this one was a dud.
0	Not what I was hoping for: I was really hoping for a dryer that would get rid of some of the frizz and curls I started getting when I turned 30 - an unexpected and unwelcome byproduct of aging. This seemed perfect, but the dryer is so weak, it takes forever to dry my hair and virtually no straightening effect. After using it, I still have to straighten my hair with a flat iron. So I've gone back to drying my hair with a regular dryer (more power and therefore faster) and using the flat iron. I guess I should have known it sounded too good to be true.
0	Baffled: I ordered it, thinking it was something else, and then when it arrived, I was intrigued and had to try it. Okay, it will straighten but not certain the point of it. I can't use it to curl the ends and it seems a flat iron would do a better job. I used it once, didn't like it. Tried it the second time to see if I just wasn't using it right, and still wasn't thrilled. It is now in my dead heap pile of unused hair gadgets.
0	Disappointing at best: Sadly, I had high hopes for this little wonder, but it didn't deliver. It is difficult to maneuver and not powerful enough to blow out my short flippy style.
1	Love this thing!!: I have moderatly curly hair and have never known how to style it. I am uncoordinated with flat irons and round brushes with hair dryers. This thing is awsome. I can easily style my hair straight and not feel like I need an extra hand. It is adjustable depending how curly your hair is. It is easily packable for traveling. Apply straightning product, if desired, after you wash, then style when your hair is about two thirds dry, or if you wash your hair at night, just dampen it a little in the AM and style.
1	Good ink: I bought this to replace my Omas black ink that was running out to use in my Lamy 2000 fountain pen. The ink flows fine and gives even coverage on the two kind of paper I commonly use, I would definitely recommend it. The ink lost one star because it is a dark, dark grey rather than a true black as was the Omas but only suffers when held right next to one another. I don't know if this is due to the paper I am using. Also it seems this ink drys a little slower and thus smudges somewhat easier, this is NOT an objective measurement however but a feeling and obviously will depend on the paper used.
0	Too thin: I purchased this after reading the great reviews and information at the manufacturer's website. This ink is waterproof. But it is also very thin, permeates nibs and runs all over the metal part of the nib. If you use a paper that is not very absorbent it may work, or on checks. But on normal paper, it flares and distorts writing. The color when dried is not totally black but a dark gray.
1	Great ink!: A few weeks ago, I bought a few disposable fountain pens to see if I liked them, and after a few days, I began using them as my primary pens. The problem was that they had (very) bad ink in them, so when I ran out of ink, I decided to attempt to refill them with Noodler's ink-- and it worked! This stuff is pitch black, and best of all, it doesn't bleed or "feather" when you're writing with it.Works well in:Pilot Varsity Disposable Fountain Pen Assorted Ink 7-Pack Pouch (90029)
0	Structurally sound but: This is a good binder. I only did not work for me because the width only is enough to fit 8.5 x11 sheets of paper. If you wish to include tab dividers the will protrude past the width of the binder. Also the expansion is limited in that you start from 3" and expand to 5" inches. The binder cannot collapse smaller than 3". So as long as these two items are not an issue, it is sturdy and durable
0	Immoral movie: This movie could have been so good. The storyline was great and the relationship between Mr. Sorrell & his son is wonderful. However, there were lots of bedroom scenes. Leading character was very immoral and there was language. In the end, the son winds up euthanizing his father after the encouragement of his wife. Very dissapointed
1	Entertaining tribute: The celebration of Duke Ellington a century after his birth has produced a wealth of tributes and, thankfully, some fine reissues of his work. This CD takes a more contemporary approach to Ellington's music resulting in a sort of smooth jazz sampler of the Duke. It's a very entertaining approach with some stellar work by an all-star roster of artists. Well worth a listen.
0	They changed the words!: Don't buy this one either ... Unless you like grooving to the wrong words. I thought I was going to be sent back to the good old days ... Save your money. You won't get a refund! You can't call anyone. I got it "DRY"!
0	poor product: I brought this product 7mths ago and it has been falling apart. Presently one of the legs of the chair has broke( crack into 2 piceces ) .I would like to know how do I go about contact the manufacturer about this matter .
0	she's so dull: She started out as the "German Britney Spears" and somehow she got stuck there. Her songs have no message, no great melody and are absolutely shallow. So is her image. She still stays "clean" (in contrast to Britney) and it extremely boring and superficial (when it comes to stardom - no meant personally)
1	It's finally on DVD!: I've been waiting for this movie to come out on DVD since I first got a DVD player about three years ago. Ray Liotta gives an excellent performance as a man falsely accused of murder trying to find his wife's killer. The plot is very interesting and original and presented so that it is believable and intense. Definitely a must-have.
1	applied the knowladge: i have read this book with a great deal of intrest. it was a great help in implementing change and designing a organization structure that is able to deliver on the new strategy.
1	akjee: the book covers very detailed instructions for the beginners to understand and follow the psychic healing.i have yet to practice and experiance the process
0	A waste of money!!!: I remembered watching this movie as a kid and really enjoying it. However, after rewatching the Transformers Season1 4 disc DVD set, this movie pales in comparison. The characters lacked personality and didn't look as interesting as the others. I recommend that you save your money and put it towards the more expensive, but more enjoyable, DVD box sets.
0	forgive me.............: Ok, ok, I realize that I am going to be fried for this but here goes.......I loved this movie as a child. I worshiped the TV series and I still have quite the collection of Autobots, and Decepticons. However, when my friend got me this film for my birthday, I watched it and found that it really did not hold my interest anymore. I think this film better served its purpose in the 80's, and is truly lost in today's modern era of animation. I would, however, like to see this film remade with better animation, and a FAR better soundtrack. I love the toys, but I did not like this movie.
1	cursing in this 80's hit movie: For those who jest cant get over the part that there was some cursing in this 80's hit movie please consider that there's was more of that in the live action movie. The same live action movie that you took your stupid little brats to see!!!!!.... get over it! i bet you freak out when bugs bunny dress in Drag too!
1	MATRIX FOREVER!! OUT OF PRINT> AGAIN!!!!!: I can not believe this has gone out of print again. Its the greatest anime movie ever.It always goes through long periods of time being unnavailable. I don't get it.Maybe the next DVD version will be better than this one. This version was great for being uncensored. But the extras were weak. It should have at least had two discs and included the alternate TV version. Or at least its opening Star Wars styled scrollthat replaced the opening credits. The music video "The Touch" was also not included. Also excluded were the animated bumpers narrated by a computer animated "Optimus Prime" that played when the movie aired on television in 5 partson the TV series. They would have made a nice extra.
1	Darryls Review on Transformers 20th Anniversary dvd: Great movie. To date the best version out there. 2 disc! It was great watching it with commentary from fans. This was just awesome. The colour and widescreen format are surperb. Many special features including commentaries, interviews, trailers etc. The Scramble City episode which is a special feature, which I was looking forward to fell below expectations due to the fact you could only watch it with commentary. Only about four toy commercials. There are easter eggs on both discs (old Diaclone toy commercials). Overall a great addition to my dvd collection and fully recommended.
0	Alert alert! Not compatible with Mac!: This DVD disc was not recognized on my Apple PowerBook G3 Firewire. The DVD drive tried to spin the disc up but gave up after a few seconds. There's no DVD icon on the desktop. I tried on both OS 9 and OS X, and "df -k" on OS X did not show a mounted volume in the DVD drive.Since the TF Season1 Collector's Edition DVD discs play fine on the same laptop, it's got to be the TFTM DVD disc that's mastered non-Macintosh compatible. Major disappointment, since I own the Canadian VHS version of TFTM (containg that four-letter word) and was really looking forward to owning the uncensored edition on DVD.
1	One of the most beautiful creation,In the animation industry: One of best animation in 80's; A now,transformers never die, now we got the beast wars and there transformers too, Well the transformers the movie is a must have. A now, this would be interesting, how about if this was on DVD and animated in 3D computer like the beast wars, Now that would be a creation of gods.
1	Best movie ever: I happy with this purchas it a used product but came in realy good condition I thought it took a lil long to get here but notice that it was from Canada understood why it took a lil while but worth the wait
1	The Decepticons Learn A New Skill: HOW ODD!!!!! just as it really counts the decepticons learn to aim straight managing to wipe out five of the original transformers in one go after numerous attempts. Much as this film is very very good and the music is outstanding. But it has as always all the same tramsformers inconstincies. But much to all our pleasure it has all the wounderful and debonair wit of Starscream that we have all come to know and love and with Leonard Nimoy adding a nice "Edge" to Galvatron... Still all in all a Very Good Purchase.
1	Very Good: I saw this in the movie theather. It rocked then and it still rocks. The story line is superb. The charactors are well written. The violence might scare some young ones. After I saw this movie I never stopped talking aobut it. I highly recommend it!
1	A blast from the past!: Unlike many things I used to like and am rediscovering to find I dont like as much, Transformers has only gotten better with age! Man, its like the best of western animation and japanese in an incredible amalgamation! if you've never seen the Transofrmers, don't be influenced by their bastardized offspring, beast wars, this cartoon was and is great!
0	disappointed by this board game: I bought this game because it promised a "green" experience for the entire family. i must say, i was highly disappointed. is it called "green" because you are dealing with vegetables? So be it. My family could not find any interest in this game, not even my four year old whom we bought the game for. I did not find the added value of this game. don't waist your money on this.
1	BEST MUTI VITAMINS IN THE MARKET: For Years i been taking it yes your urine may turn yellow i have orange label and sometimes if you eat it with food your stomach might hurt but its life its a good vitamins A C E D The best! I Rec People To Try This Vitamin
0	Evolution is true: Science in no way refutes evolution, if used correctly. The authors of this book don't have an inkling of what 'science' is. If you're thinking about buying this book, do yourself a favor and go buy "On the Origin of Species" by Charles Darwin. That is, if you care about the truth. This book is full of lies. What it preaches is blatantly wrong and you would be a fool to believe a word of it.
1	one of the most beautiful songs: this song is about lyrics, lyrics, lyrics. and leigh nash's beautiful vocals.i loved the bounce movie, but this song is more beautiful. actually, its one of our "songs" for my boyfriend and I. i think it should have recieved radio play, but i don't think it did. my favorite version of this song is the movie mix, which is more like and extended version. the only song i did not like is walking with strangers which is not sung by leigh nash. i just did not connect with it at all.need to be next to you is a good song for all you hopeless romantic types. the music video is really cool, it has images from the movie, which enhances what i just said about being a hopless romantic.. so with that being said i give 4 out of 5
0	this movie is available on iTunes!!!: it's less than 20 bucks....so don't go spending anymore than that in this wonderful economy we have!!Cheers..Tony(NYC)
1	Clear, Concise - What All Programming Books Should Be!: Those wishing to shift into the .NET phase will thoroughly enjoy Petzold's Key of C#. Not only does it teach the fundamentals clearly, it builds off the fundamentals with a clever approach to programming. Programming in the Key of C# promotes experimentation and critical thinking.
0	I have such a Tooth-Ache: This movie had such a sugar sweet quality about it, I got a tooth-ache. I am surprised they didn't go back and save Political leaders and the like. Enjoyable most of the time if you can get past the obvious lack of rational thought, and wasted screen time. I should have rented it on video. Not a suitable movie to sit through at the theatre. TOO LONG. Rent it, make popcorn, take a break every 20-30 minutes, you're good to go.
0	Unsatisfactory: I waited almost two months to rent this video. Unfortunately., I was disappointed. The movie while poignant, was spasmodic and disjointed. I had to try too hard to piece together the events while they were occurring. James Caviezel's performance was compelling. Dennis Quaid's acting was fair.
1	a thriller of what if times meet.: very creative and well-made thriller.it is surprising viewers.when u leave cinema(or closes dvd/video/vcd)u are thinking it is worth paying 2 $(or renting or buying).for third dimension flick-buffs.
1	Intelligent and heart-wringing: This is one of the few satisfying movies I can remember seeing. Apart from loving Dennis Quaid, who puts in a great performance, I like this film for its unabashed good storytelling. It is tense because it allows us to grow incredibly involved with the characters. Moreover, apart from the usual coincidence thing, the science fiction plot doesn't have holes. May you enjoy this movie as much as I did!
1	Illogical But Wonderful: Even if you accept the basic premise of this movie, a re-connection between long dead fireman father and still grieving policeman son via ham radio, you will find something profoundly illogical in some of the individual scenes. That doesn't prevent it from being extremely moving thanks to beautiful flat-out emotional performances by Dennis Quaid, Jim Caviezel and flawlessly cast supporting actors. Look for an extraordinarily moving fire rescue scene. Some of the suspense set pieces worked into the story are superb.This film definitely overcomes its narrative flaws.Walmer Road in Toronto puts in a fine appearance as a street in Queens, N.Y.
1	Fun Science Fiction: This movie is a feel good, science fiction movie with a murder mystery and plenty of action woven into it.
0	FRequency: Very strange to follow. Too much forward and backwards in the plot. Like the suspense, probably won't watch again.Too shifty.
1	A great character!: Catspaw was my introduction to Cat. Like other reviewers, I expected a bit of lite fluff to while away a boring afternoon, and got Paydirt with a capital 'P'. Vinge's creation, whom she called in an interview the embodiment of her sense of outrage at social injustice, is on my personal list of favorite literary characters of all-time. Read the book and find out why.
1	Enjoyable book: I am a country music fan and have seen the movie many times. I wanted to read the book and I'm glad I did. It was enjoyable.
1	excellant: this bok was recommed to me by my daughterinlaw,it was warm and funny and so true of Loretta Lynn,full of truth and surprises
0	The Soviet view of the Cold War: Tass is Authorized to Announce is the Soviet version of any spy thriller you have ever read (or seen on the big screen) - but with the KGB as the good guys, attempting to foil the sinster plots of the CIA. However, Semenov lacks the semantics of say, a Tom Clancy. The plot is razor thin, the anti-semitism is revolting, and the the resolution of the conflict is laughable.While the book is certainly dated, (Cold War intrigue in Africa is so passe), it is an entertaining read if only to see how the USSR understood detente and cold war politics. Other than that, the book is tripe - not recommended.
1	Solitary Witch: I bought this book a few years ago. It's always a range between love it and hate it when it comes to her work. For this one, I just like it. There is some information that I take and refer back to (elements, Witches' Pyramid, etc), but I know that there's more to my Path. I wouldn't say that she's "Fluffy" only because she puts witchcraft in terms so teenagers can understand it. There are things that I don't agree with, but all-in-all it's a good reference.)O(
1	LOVE: Love. Love. LOVE this book! It has basically everything. Like a wiccan/ pagan dictionary. Of course You wouldnt read it from cover to cover. You could. But i wouldnt suggest it. But thats good! it means theres tons upon tons of info! It's great!
1	Our favorite game, by far.: Cooperative games help keep the peace at our house and this is the one we play the most. We have so much fun working together to try to beat the robber--no tears at the end of this game!
0	If you buy this, you're buying s**t. Literally.: I love Marilyn Manson!But... after watching this movie, I had a change of thoughts. If you like to see band members vomiting, band members deficating, and then playing with it, people rubbing stuff against their bare naked d*ck, and other profanity, you should buy this movie. I thought it would just be a movie of their tour, but it's a bunch of s**t. Stick to the CD's. By the way, I think Courtney put a hell of a show on at the tour! Manson... a bit sick. I still think that Manson kicks, but some of the stuff he does just disgustes me so much, and makes me think just what he's puting in the minds of our youth today. You think about it. The shootings at that school for instance...
0	Tank top: I am very unimpressed by this product. Sizing is very small and the product it flimzy and poorly made. After 2 washings it had shrunk to the point where I just threw it away. I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone.
0	Worthless: Doesn't fit the average10" subwoofer. Edge of grills sits on surround, doesn't even reach subwoofer basket. Don't waste your money.
0	You call this Tai Chi???: I would give this one0 star if Amazon allowed me.I read all the good reviews on this DVD and decided to get a copy. Luckly we had one from the local library.After I reviewed the library copy, I am completely shocked that someone can produce a DVD like this one and call it "Tai Chi". It is not even half way close.The demonstrator didn't even get his movement right. In fact the content of the DVD is a set of morning exercise combining a little bit of everything possibly Asian: primary school morning exercise, some basic Yoga breathing and postures, some partial Tai Chi gesture. Coming from an Asian background, I almost felt this is an insult.If you are serious about learning Tai Chi, don't get misled by this DVD.
0	Video Quality is VERY POOR - i think they copied the copy of a copy of a copy...: I like the video but it jumps ahead. For the 20 minute workout, i'm done in15! The 60 minute program is more like 40.i think of all of the tutorials, i have seen only1 all the way through and most, it just skips over them. It is horrible! I tried this but the video is such poor quality that it makes it difficult to feel it is doing any good.
0	Morey is ignorant of the literature: This book deals in stereotypes and caricatures. It ignores the example of Jesus Christ, and denies the exile status of God's predestined elect people. It begs the question continually by assuming that the "responsible" thing to do is to kill the bad guys. As in his book on hell and the immortality of the soul, there is no evidence of Morey carefully reading the literature of those he attacks.For a page by page refutation of this book, I recommend Richard Barber's "Whenis it right to Fight? Never", available from Pilgrim Brethren Press, po box171, Petersburg, Ohio 44454. Barber is a sovereign grace pacifist, like me.
0	Shallow and Poorly Thought Out: The best thing about Morey's book is the Recommended Reading list at the end. Too bad he didn't study some of the books he listed. John Howard Yoder could have helped him tremendously. For the most part he omitted the most significant pacifists of the twentieth century. Yet he claims to offer a rebuttal to a position he doesn't remotely understand.This ill considered little book is filled with poorly examined assumptions. If you are looking for a thoughtful and biblically insightful defense of war , this is not it. But if you want a shallow piece of work that may reinforce your prejudice, When Is It Right To Fight? may be exactly what you have in mind.
1	Lee plays the good guy!: This has to be one of the finest of the Hammer collection. Lee is piercing in his role as the Duc De Richelieu. There are occultists galore and it's up to Lee and his pal to save the son of a friend and his lover from the eternal grip of the creepiest villan Hammer studios ever unleashed. You must see this movie in widescreen! The visual created by director Terrence Fisher, of the English countryside, will give you a warm fuzzy until the final clash between good and evil.
0	merlin: not that good. script for moviewhy do you need to add a specific amount of words? less can be better, especially in a review
0	Did not speak to me, prefer "Peaceful Warrior" series: How to write a review about a book that does not speak to you? Difficult. While I liked "The Teachings of Don Juan: A Yaqui Way of Knowledge" (at least the first part) somehow "Journey to Ixtlan" did not speak to me at all. It came across as boring, meaningless walking and dialogues in desert without wisdom revealing to me.I certainly preferred the whole Dan Millman's "Peaceful Warrior" series with spiritual wisdom weaved into interesting adventures.
1	The Court Jester: Danny Kaye was a gifted comic actor who not only touched and entertained millions of children, but at his best, brought out the child in all of us. A hilarious spoof on the swashbuckler picture, "The Court Jester" is widely regarded as his finest screen hour. With lots of color, action and excitement framing the immortal gags, this is family entertainment at its best .
0	Worst film ever?: By film's end, I was hoping the Driller Killer would show up to put Telly and Capser out of their misery. In the end, the only people you truly feel sorry for, is the man on the subway with no legs and the skater punk who gets beaten nearly to death.
0	Horrible: I am only14 years old. I would think that a movie like this would have an impact on someone my age. It didnt. It nearly put me to sleep. It was the biggest waste of money in my life. I just bought it today and am throwing it away today also.All this movie offers is an inaccurate portrait or teens, and the story of a group of moron teenagers who thinks its cool to be going around drinking, smoking, engaging in brutal fights with people and other acts of vandalism, having sex with girls between the age of12 and15, and stealing from their parents.This was a huge waste of an hour and a half. I only gave this movie1 star because amazon doesn't allow me to give it0.If you are looking for a movie that offers the story of troubled teens, and is GOOD, Thirteen is the movie you wanna watch.
0	Yuck, Yuck, Yuck: I hated this movie. SO unrealistic. Sure, maybe there are some little freaks running around raping and drinking and beating. But I AM a teenager in a city. NOBODY acts like this!What the hell is the point of this movie? To scare the crap out of parents?Also, the rape scene was vile. At first I respected the director for showing it and not shying away. A FULL MINUTE LATER, I started feeling awkward and uncomfortable. It wasn't even artistic, it was just disgusting and truly disturbing.
1	This a real movie about real things.: This movie paints a picture of what goes on in the lives of kids all across the nation daily. This is a must see movie for many parents. Your kids may be faced with many of these decisions every day. It portrays some of the pressure for teens in a modern society. You need to see this movie and thoroughly understand it.
1	Great movie?: This movie was pretty good, though there is a lot of sex, drugs, drinking, violence etc... I'm from NYC and some ppl i know are like that i think it shows what teen life is like for some ppl in NY. I loved how they used Washington Sq. Park-a lot of ppl that are like the charaters in the movie go to that park for the same reasons... skateboard, pick fights, do drugs etc.... This movie seemed so real and i hope there would be more movies like this. -14
1	excellent movie: This movie depicts the real lives of teens grouwing up in nyc. I live in nyc and i have seen all of this going on. The only way to protect todays youth is to scare the hell out of them with movies like this.
1	Real-life look into the life of teens: This is my all-time favorite movie. In some ways I can relate to this movie. I have friends who are just like these "KIDS". This movie takes a true look into a teens life. I recommend this movie to other teens and pre-teens.
1	dream: I remember when I thought this film was controversial lol that is until I saw "Bully" Anyway this movie is about a boy who is obsessed with (...) girls and well all the kids lives are pretty much full of drugs and sex. Good ending, what goes around comes around.
1	Not A KIDS Movie: Being a teen boy I wanted to see this movie for all the hot chicks. To my disappiontment there wasn't any. Just a bunch of guys having sex and walking around shirtless and showing us their rear ends. Justin Pierce "Casper", the blonde boy at the guys house that was shaking, and kid urinating near Casper are hot. We get to see all of them shirtless. If you get the Widescreen DVD on the far left you can see Justin's behind in a graphic rape/sex scene. RIP Justin I will miss you...you were so hot.
1	Nice Debut: Saw these guys open for Butch Walker in Boston a couple months ago and they played a nice set. Since I liked what I heard I picked up the album. Good stuff, give it a listen.
0	Pretty but not made well: They are not fitted. They are very puffy and baggy. Do not fit at all like they are suppose to.
0	something u would'nt expect: this movie is terrible. charectors are weak and the plot just plains sucks on white bread. if anything, you should see100 girls. I dont think this movie should have even been made.
1	Our Father Abraham: Our Father Abraham: Jewish Roots of the Christian FaithA book every Christian should read. We cannot fully understand the teachings of Jesus and our Bible without a through knowledge of Jewish history and culture. We worship a Jewish savior, who worshiped in a synagogue, honored and practiced Jewish rituals. We read from a Jewish book, our Bible written by Jewish men. To fully understand the symbolism in the Bible we must know something about Jewish religeous practices.Christianity is a branch attached to a tree that has its roots in Judaism This book is one of the best available for a deeper understanding of Jewish culture and religeon. I highly reccomend this book to all Christains wishing to have a deeper understanding of their faith and its beginnings.
0	Never got it, never heard from them: I never received this product and have not heard from the vendor except to ask for a review.
0	BAD BACKSTREET BOYS: If you've ever seen a David DeCouteau movie (Brotherood, Leeches, Werewolves of New York) you know what to expect: a homoerotic mishmash of ridiculous plotting, hunky boys in skimpy underwear; and relentless padding consisting of slow motion swaggering and lots of pecs and abs. In RING OF DARKNESS, Adrienne Barbeau (Swamp Thing, Fog, Creepshow, Maude) plays the boy band's seductive manager who stages an audition to replace the band's lead singer who tried to leave them after he found out what the boys in the band were in reality. Barbeau does well as always, but the rest of the insanely attractive cast needs acting lessons badly. By the time you've figured out just what these hunks do to keep their looks, you've had to sit through some pretty derivative plotting and a predictably campy ending. DeCouteau needs to rethink his future projects and at least come up with more than just pretty bods.
0	Wow bad even by DeCoteau standards: A real time waster. Not even decent underwear scenes for those who buy these things for that.
0	It was very wordy and the worst book I have ever read: Seriously, this book is just convoluted and boring. I can't believe this is called a classic. Its terrible and the educators at certain high schools should not force this book upon kids--it lowers their grades and intelligence.
1	Love it!: The download was quick. This story looks great on my kindle. I am so glad to have purchased this item!
1	Never becomes passe!: I decided to read this book after watching it on PBS. Of course there was more detail in the actual novel and Jane Austen never fails to "dazzle you with her footwork". The description and narrative is beautiful and makes you feels as if you were actually there.
0	Didn't like the paper quality and presentation: I bought them (all the Barnes & Noble Classics) to complete my Jane Austen's collection, and honestly, didn't like the paper quality, it seems like they didn't even care for the presentation of them; it didn't look elegant, cheap to be more specific.
0	Tough going: Reading this novel was slow going. As a guy, I found the lack of action stultifying, and the flashes of humor were too quaint for me to derive any pleasure from them. The answer to the book's primary riddle--who shall Emma marry?--becomes obvious early on, and everything else is just a tedious pairing off until that riddle is expressly answered. There's a bit of local and historical color, but rarely does the narrative rise above the description of, say, a summer outing. Not one of Jane Austen's best.
0	Just OK: The first 2 Jane Austen books I read were Pride and Prejudice and Sense and Sensibility. Both I considered excellent books, Pride and Prejudice being my favorite. I had high hopes of Emma, considering it had been made into the modern movie "Clueless". However, I have found this book very tiresome and it took me a long time to trudge my way through it. It may be the fact that I didn't like the main character as I had in the other books, but this book really went by slowly. It wasn't that bad of a story and really deserves 21/2 stars instead of the given 2 stars, but thats not an option. I would still recommend people to read the book for the good plot behind slow movement and seeing this prideful heroine transformed into a more likeable person.
1	What's the fuss about Jane Austen?: I'm so sorry, but I simply fail to see what's so wonderful about Jane Austen. Her writing is adroit, and paints an intriguing picture of her times. She illustrates the psychology of a historic culture, but....I just don't find her all that wonderful. I realize I'll be stoned by all the Jane Austen fans out there, but THERE IT IS.
0	Help us all: I am quite confused on how people could like this book. For one it takes forever to get to the point. Plus how could we possibly like Emma. She is so self centered and ignorant. The only two times in which she can somewhat appeal to us is when she crys and in comparison to Mrs. Elton. This is a mockery of upper class life of the19th century and Jane Austen, to my knowledge, lived a somewhat isolated life. How could she write a book on a topic which she doesn't know about. This further mocks the upper class leaving the point of this book as being entertainment. Why put us through 500 pages of pain. I think Jane Austen was right when she said " no one but myself will much like [Emma]."
1	Great Book!: This may very well be my second favorite Jane Austen book. The plot is ingenious, and the characters are hilarious. Dover does a good job of publishing, and this book is no exception. I highly recommend Emma!
0	I Hate Emma: I do like19th Century fiction. I do like Pride and Predjudice. I know lots of people don't like saying Classics are uninteresting. Apparantly Jane Austen said after writing this book that she had wanted to create a character that no-one would like but herself. I am the only person I know who hates Emma. I agree that the book is well written but I just don't like Emma. Sorry if you do.
0	Doesn't survive the test of time: I endured through the entire audiobook because I finish what I start but this book had very little interest for me. First I think it's a chick book, one that women would find more interesting, second it's about a spoiled brat that thinks herself the world, with which most readers will not sympathize. Maybe the book was great in the time when it was published, but the style does not suit me for these reasons. The setting was not interesting for me:18th century England in the countryside where nothing happens, where propriety is more important that authenticity and passion. The climax of the novel, like the contemporary English culture, is all too subtle for my taste and like the rest of the book lacks the drama that I expected from this supposed classic. In short I think other great books have lasted the test of time but this is certainly not one of them. It too easily loses your attention.
1	Austen sparkles as always, but this is no Pride and Prej!: Personally, I love everything Jane Austen ever wrote to BITS. But none of her works (except maybe the humorously offbeat "Northanger Abbey") can match the high standards set by "Pride and Prejudice". There's the usual cast of comic characters, and some scenes really are a scream, but the heroine, Emma Woodhouse, and her 'consort' Frank Churchill are a bit too brattish for my liking. Their 'humour' (acidly bitchy spoilt brat gossip about the most kind-hearted and guileless members of the village) is just a little too vicious for me, and their appalling treatment of Jane Fairfax, and Harriet Smith, and the hilarious Miss Bates left me feeling a bit sick. Thank God Mr. Knightley's there to keep Emma in line. This is still a great novel, as witty and funny as "Pride and Prejudice"--but it's comedy with a bit of a nasty undertaste.
0	Rubbish: What rubbish.Way too much violence. Why do kids movies have to be so violent these days? (or when it was made).Had a few laughs (I'm an ex-pat Australian) but not worth the plastic it was made from.Certainly not recommended for general viewing as the cover shows.
1	Bernard and Miss Bianca Do It Again!: In Disney's "The Rescuers Down Under," Rescue Aid Society mice Bernard and Miss Bianca travel to Australia to help Mara Houte, the golden eagle. With the assistance of Wilbur, an albatross, and numerous other friends encountered along the way (such as a wise-cracking kangaroo rat), they hurry to help the endangered bird. Voice talents of Bob Newhart (Bernard), Eva Gabor (Miss Bianca) and John Candy (Wilbur) move the story along at a good pace. George C. Scott provides voice for the villain, a bounty hunter of endangered animals. Scott's sidekick is a goanna lizard called Joana - and there is some fascinating interplay between the lizard and the man. A sidebar plot is Bernard's plan to propose marriage to Miss Bianca ... and all of the things that conspire to get in the way. This is a nice movie for the entire family, and one with a good message. I highly recommend it.
1	cave twins review from grandkids.: Or rather my Granddaughters love it. Recommended to them by Grandma who has fond memories of reading it when she was their age. The feedback from Heidi ( to whom it was sent ) was " Wow Wicked Brilliant !"
0	Incorrect information in this book: I don't recommend this book due to many incorrect observations and information noted in the chapters. I was very surprised that this book was recommended by other readers because there were many mistakes and errors in the book. Some important topics were discussed incorrectly and others were too brief. To find out and confirm this I gave this book to several local real estate contractors and they pointed out many other errors in this book that even I was unaware of. They explained to me how many things discussed in the book were outdated or not relevant.
0	Negative review - too basic and not too helpful: The only time I would write a negative review if I think a book has been over rated. This book is definitely over rated. My husband and I are real estate investors and continually read books to improve our profits. We both felt this book was too basic and we did not get helpful information. We go to monthly meetings for investors in our county and this is one of the books on the "don't buy" list on our bulletin board!
1	A "MUST READ" for all Home Inspectors!: This book is the premiere reference book for new Home Inspectors. The authors' knowledge is based on thousands of inspections. The layout and style of the book make it very easy to read and reference. There is a lifetime worth of valuable home inspection information at a very reasonable cost. MUST READ
0	This book did not teach me anything I didn't already know: If you are looking for a book that will teach you a lot about real estate and home inspections then this is not the book for you. The chapter information and text content of this book was very basic and did not teach me anything I didn't already learn from other books that were much better. Inspecting homes is something I have done for many years and I would not recommend this book to any customers or contractors. If you know absolutely nothing about real estate then you might learn a few things but not too much.
0	Garbage - Avoid: The dimensions indicate1/4 inch which would be fine except it is apparently the FOLDED dimension. Give me a break!
0	freely available: Since those responsible for this animated version of "Animal Farm" failed to renew their copyright (this came out in1954), this film is now freely available, for example on YouTube, where it can be legally uploaded in its entirety.It follows the book much more than the recent version did, although still very loosely. The biggest difference is its completely different, more hopeful ending.
1	The Best Bible Story Book We Own!: We own many Bible story books, but this one is my favorite. We read from this book every day, and the kids love it. It includes stories that are left out of many children's Bible story books. It is wonderful to read in order, and it really keeps the attention of the children. When it's time to shut the book, my kids say, "What's the story for tomorrow called, Mommy?", because they so look forward to reading this book.
0	Skip this author!: I purchased this relatively unknown book due, in part, to the positive reviews. I was misled. As an avid reader, this book was underdeveloped and poorly written. The numerous typos are distracting and the characters lack depth. I forced myself to read the book, hoping it would improve but it did not. Save your money do not buy this book or anything by this author.
1	I Love It!!: I love this book. I am almost done the series. It is an amazing book! There is a huge series coming after this book, three other series! I hope you like it! Rachael at age11and1/2 :}
1	The gateway to another world!: I started the book when I was seven or so, and I almost couldn't put it down at night! Each chapter has gripping detail, enough violence to satesfy a kid my age, and the charecter's actions and feelings were so real-like that I felt like I was right there, at a Gathering, right there, at the fight between ThunderClan and ShadowClan, right there, in the ThunderClan camp. I'm ten now, have read the whole first series twice and have started the second series, and I'd recomend this book to any kid who likes cats, excitment, adventure, and a litle pinch of violence now and then in their books. The begining of the story of Rusty, the so-called kittypet, who joins a clan of feral cats and saves the day in the end, who came from Firepaw to Fireheart, the ThunderClan warrior!
1	i love this book: this is an amazing book with great action and is a pageturner with a great plot and lots of supense.
1	Great book: Very enjoyable you can never stop because this book is filled with suspends and cold hangers this was a great book
1	A great book!: I'm sorry to give you this late response because I read this book today. This was an excellent book! I would recommend everyone to read this book. This book inspired me about not giving up on your goal.
1	ONE OF THE GREATEST BOOKS ON EARTH!!!!!: I recommend this book to any person on the face of the earth! This book is great for cat lovers,dog lovers,horse lovers,any kind of lover! After reading this I bought the rest of the series,and I know you'll love it too!! I SAY IT SHOULD BE AWARDED THE NEWBERY HONOR AWARD!!! Read this book to find how Rusty, a kittypet (a house cat) finds his destiny to become a great warrior!A #1 Fan,Kierstyn (Forestfur)
1	Great!: Oh, this series is so good! I am waiting impatiently for the 6th one to come out, and so i am reading all the other ones over and over again. And I've just learned that there is to be a new series of Warriors. All new characters and clans! Stone clan, sky clan, and some other ones I forgot. it's called Midnight and is coming out next year on March. I'm going to pre-order mine's now!
1	LOVE IT!!: Okay, first off I'll tell you that all the books in the series (there are four main series, then a couple "in-between" books) are GREAT! However, it gets to be too much. Remembering all the names, what Clan they come from, who their mate is, who there kits are, who their friends/enemies are, who their brothers and sisters are, it's too much!But, I'm not here to bag on the books, I read the first one because a bunch of my friends were going on and on about them, it's a couple weeks later, and I'm just finishing The Last Omen, sooo... I don't know if that says anything other than I LOVE WARRIORS!!!!
1	AMAZING: As soon as I started reading this book I was hooked. Erin Hunter did a fabulous job capturing the readers intrest and keeping them interested. Even my brother (who hates cats) was compelled to read this novel.
0	plotless: It is an undramatic visage of what should be a dramatic era of Margaret Thatcher. An example paragraph of the endless descriptions that mar the book (if i'm breaking copyrights laws, let me know):Nick wasn't sure how it started. Sam Zeman was laughing so much he lay back on the floor, but then choked and had to sit up. One of the girls pointed at him mockingly, but it wasn't mockery, she was laughing uncontrollably herself. Nat was red in the face, pinching the tears out of his eyes and pulling down the corners of his mouth to try to stop it. Nick could only stop giggling by glaring at the floor, and as soon as he looked up he was giggling again convulsively, it was like hiccups, it was hiccups, all mixed up together with the whooping, inexplicable funniness of the brandy bottle, the Renoir lady, the gilded plaster crown above the bed, all of them with their ideas and bow ties and plans and objections.
0	Not worth it: After finally finishing this book, I am very surprised that it won a prize. The first several hundred pages have the main character (Nick Guest) doing little more than having sex, fantasizing about having sex with every other male character (major or minor), or wondering if anyone else can guess that he's fantasizing about sex.Perhaps it would be a better read for someone British, because I found it hard to appreciate the depiction of life in the British aristocracy. The character development felt very heavy-handed and repetitive, as one scene after another depicted Nick feeling embarrassed or trying to figure out how to handle a social situation.The end of the book was much more rewarding, as the web of characters unravelled and their pretensions were stripped away. I also enjoyed some clever Henry James references. Still, I don't think the investment it takes to slog through the beginning is worth it overall.
1	My Comfort Book: This book helped me raise three little boys born in two and a half years. From Diapers to trucks and fighting, I found what I needed to know in these pages. I am now sending copies to my three neices who have just had boys of their own. Truly trans-generational!
0	Confusing even if you are not an idiot: This book is poorly organized and confusing. The authors used way too many quotations from other sources, i.e. books, websites. In the end, I have to wonder what the authors' own take is on the subject. It doesn't have a backbone of its own, period.
0	Awful movie.: Amazing, but the name is the most redeeming quality of this movie. The "chain gang" is comprised of MEN, and only men. Men escape from a chain gang with a little help from two women. Acting is okay to bad, quality is okay to bad, story is okay to bad.
1	social scientists, take your medecine!: Sowell is a true intellectual. He is not afraid to go where his mind takes him. In this work he takes on his common peeve: social engineering. For Sowell nothing is worse than utopian minded do-gooders armed with inadequate knowledge of the subjects they pontificate on. To be frank, I think Sowell's arguments are sometimes thin (much social engineering is done well and is necessary), but it is always good to read someone who will challenge convention, especially when that person is as bright as Sowell is.
1	Sowell is the soul of our time: This book has only gained by the passage of time since it was written. It is clear that his analysis of the huge separation between those who view man as "constrained" vs the modern Liberal viewpoint has only grown deeper. He actually makes the best case I have read for the Liberal position, and it is still sorely lacking. I am so grateful that he lives and writes.
1	Very stable: Excellent quality. Very stable . I ride indoors twice a week for a hour. This device is perfect for keeping my bike steady.
1	a must have: This climbing block is excellent stablizer for frontwheel and gives it a balance. It also maintains height of front wheel. I never " stacked " more than one because I never ordered more because of expence. I did not use it for climbing, nor I had any difficulty climbing my bike. I suggest buying it with your cycleops unit.
0	they are posers: i bet you10$ that they stole destination unkown from the lyrics of ruby soho by rancid kicks there gay poopy areses there stupid punk wannabes like blink182 listen to us bombs or rancid or operation ivy or the vandals or the dropkick murphys or the clash or sublime or the casaulties
1	This is a great CD: This one of my favorite albums. If you like Green Day or Blink, or just wnat to listen to some awsome pop/punk music, I suggest that you go out and by this album. I also suggest that you go out and see MEST aoon. I've seen them twice and they put on a kick-butt... show.
1	Mest above all: Mest is the greatest band of all time, I highly recommend that you go out and buy the Waisting Time CD, you will not be disappointed...
1	Destination Unknown: Destination Unknown by Mest, is such a great CD, their songs are songs that people can relate to, and the catchyness of the songs will stick in your head. This Cd is by far the best cd i've heard yet.
1	Mest is WICKED: Mest takes every genre and mixes it together. They have the pop punk edge, of course, over thuggish R&B;/Rap beats, and they have some raggae and ballads mixed in there as well. This is teenage angst, with the humor of the Beastie Boys, and the angst of Good Charlotte.They're really eclectic, and not too hard on the eyes either. :)
1	I love this CD: I love Mest....I've seen them in concert, and they're awesome. Tony is great. This is the 3rd CD and I think it's pretty kickass. Sure, some of the songs aren't so lyrically great, but it's fun to listen to. The songs that stand out are "Drawing Board" (who doesn't like this song?) "Cadillac" (for you people with some ghetto in you) and "Yesterday" (vocals by Jeremiah, sounds awesome).Some of the weirder songs are "Reason" and the hidden track. They're both cool, just...too jamacian. Oh well, I still listen to them.If you want a nice variety in music and fun music to listen to whenever, get this CD.Whether they're punk, pop-punk, or pop-rock, they're good.
1	Kick Ass Pop Punk...: Catchy lyrics, sick riffs, and a band with a totally cool attitude, this, in my opinion, is their best to date, with their self titled in second and mo money mo 40'z in third. The only album from Mest that i didnt really like was wasting time, but it still wasn't that bad...
1	Kick [behind] BAND!!!!: Mest is the Best!!!! I just got there cd and i fell in love with it the first time i listened to it. This is a cd every music fan must get. the songs r kick [behind] and so r the guys. if u don't go out and buy this cd i'm going to MEST you up!!!!
1	Third and other streams: Well, since other jazz-fans (mr. Dennis, mr. Chell, mr. Lampereta...) have already given quite elaborate and diverse arguments in favor of this intriguing album (plus some sophisticated counterarguments as well), I will only add a small voice in their favor and another five stars to match it...Cool and third-streamish jazz is not really my thing, but this is such a great collection of diverse, beautifully performed and arranged music that I'm left really impressed. Naturally, Lovano shines through like a real jazz-giant he obviously is.
0	Junk -- will flood your kitchen: Expensive and works for less than 3 years, at which time it will flood your kitchen. I've had two dispensers and both flooded the kitchen. How this product stays on the market is beyond me.
1	This is my second time purchasing this item: I had an earlier model of this hot water dispenser for eleven years. That one had a metal container which rusted out. This newer version has a molded plastic type of water container which is definitely an improvement. I love the addition of the temperature control which the old one did not have.
1	*THE* XML book for .NET: Dino Esposito has total, absolute command of the subject matter that he expertly teaches in this book. This is a template for how all technical training books should be written. I wanted in-depth coverage of the XML object library in .NET and that is exactly what this book delivers. This is THE book on XML in .NET. Don't waste your money on anything else.It is also terrific supplemental material for the Developing XML Web Services and Server Components certification exam. I recommend Mike Gunderloy's book as an all-encompassing source (look up my review for that book); however, I recommend reading the first four chapters of this book before you start Gunderloy's book if you don't have much experience reading and writing XML in .NET. Chapters12 and13 on remoting and web services, respectively, are also great sources of exam prep material. In fact, Chapter12 on .NET Remoting is the best chapter on the subject you will find anywhere.Terry, MCAD and MCSD for Microsoft .NET
0	Hoping, But NO: Was hoping other reviews were off, but unfortunately they were right. Not even close to a recommended movie. Or as would be said by submariners, a true "Five finger gagger".
0	90 minutes gone from my life: As we used to say in the submarine service . . . you get a double punch on your Hurter Card for sitting through this. How did they get Dennis Hopper to sign on for this one? It looks like it was filmed with a camcorder. During the semi-nude scenes I found myself looking for holes in their underwear. I'll give it 2 stars since it was in color and had sound.
1	Accurate: I bought this to help me when I started school to get my degree in political science and it proved to behelpful along with another book I bought for the same reason. I use them to decipher anything I am not clear on. Drink water when using this book because it's good for you,
1	Mountain of contemplation: great book for those interested in orthodox spirituality. for more look for "the way of the pilgrim"
1	Excellent for everybody: My 8 months baby loves it!!!, he may not fully understand what's all about but you can run it a couple of times a day and he sits there still to watch, recomended for everyone
1	sesame street: Kids get to give an opinion of their favorite song and why. Encourages all children to have a voice. The songs and movement gets kids up and moving. My three month old granddaughter wiggles and kicks with the tunes, when she gets toddling she'll being dancing to it. The music, flashy colors and movement will keep any child entertained no matter what their age.
1	Great historical novel: This is a highly recommended book for anyone who is interested in the history of the Jewish Lower East Side in the late19th century and early 20th century. It is written by an author with intimate knowledge of the time and place. Written in1917, it is a very captivating and compelling story of an Eastern European Jewish immigrant's plight on The Lower East Side. I highly recommend it.
0	Singular work of genius arrives in fish wrap: The greatest achievement in western literature is now available in a bound version heretofore reserved for second rate "How to" books from the remainder bin. This publisher offers no preface, foreword, notes, or so much as an illustrator's credit for the apt cover; the sole redeeming feature of this tawdry effort. Usually clocking in at 740 pages plus, this version manages to squeeze every word of the masterwork into a nimble 554 pages, thanks to a total lack of margin space or chapter breaks. Laughably, the book's spine does not allow even for this squeezed assembly, so that it arrives splayed and bow-legged, in unintentional tribute to the willowy author perhaps. Under-inked to the point of appearing mimeographed, with serifs giving way on almost every page, this is hardly the version one needs of a book to be cherished and re-visited often.
0	Duplicates others: Typical straight-from-Project-Gutenberg textfile conversion: no ToC, no italics, no chapter breaks. See comparative review here:Ulysses
1	A Masterpiece of English Literature: After finally summoning the courage to attempt a reading of Ulysses, I am profoundly greatful that I did. While the novel is intricately layered and multi-referenced, reading it is really not as challenging as its reputation would have one believe. Moreover, it is a page-turner in the truest sense; never before have I been so absorbed by a piece of literature. Joyce's relentless and masterful descriptions of characters' thoughts, both important inner monologues and equally flippant patter, offer an insight into the human condition which is unparalled in English literature. I am utterly convinced that Ulysses is the most important novel of the twentieth century; it is a true masterpiece of literary art, one that simply makes the reader proud to be human.
1	i love it: I am very satisfied and I like it, i think....the shipping cost is a little expensive for me...( because i do not live in USA^^)anyway ..thank you & Mary Christmas!!!
0	Habent sua fata libelli: That book has a luck. It's the worst book which has ever been written. Strangely, there are some people who think it is the best one. that's what the latin phrase (above) means
0	Ulysses: This book is a struggle. I don't know where it's going and can't decide if I want to be there at the finnish.
0	Not for me.: This being my first time reading Joyce, I didn't really know what to expect. After reading for a day or two, I found that it was too scattered and hard to follow. I don't think it would be right for me to say that I wouldn't recommend it to anyone, because I think it is worth a try. I might come back to it in a few years, but right now it just isn't exactly my cup of tea.
0	Italics are capitalized: Substituting capitalization for italics is unacceptable. Also, multiline verses are collapsed into one unbroken line.
0	Dirty and cheap: Can you make a cheaper case that these chips come in? The case weighs about1 oz and is ready to fall apart. The fake felt they use disintegrates at touch leaving the chips dirty--covered in some sort of micro-fiber recycled paper dirt. The chips themselves are OK, without a reliable way to transport them this poker set isn't worth much. Of course its made in China and you get what you pay for.
0	not what it describe. when i actually had found out the chip is different when i had open the chip n making sure..: i'm not happy what i have order from here. Literally chip are color out ...seem like they been used. Dice are yellow even they are said to be ''new''. i had open the chips and feel there weight and they don't feel like11.5 feel like they put a metal in between and let it be. Terrible...cards cheap plastic card. I will never by product from them again. Description is different then what i receive that all i got to say i got the picture to show it. false advertisement given out cheap piece of crap...look GROSSS
1	High quality, casino-grade poker chip set: Casino-quality chip set. Heavy-duty case. Set is very heavy -- accounts for the high shipping charge.
0	Poor Quality: The quality of the case is poor. It does not close well. And there seems to be poor structural integrity of the case. Some of the chips are dirty or damaged somehow?
0	These Shows Have All Been Edited: All shows on this set are the edited versions. Each show is missing more than 3 minutes of footage. The other set from this company is the same. If you want the original un-cut versions then skip these. If you don't mind having missing footage, then go for it. Personally, I would rather" NOT " have something than have shows the way these are.
1	Sherman Foundations and Interval Spin: I rode the Foundations course and found that I was within my target heart rate for 24 minutes total. Instructor gives encouragement and tips for staying focused on the ride. If you turn off the lights and spin, its almost the same as being in a live class.
0	There are better flash cartooning books out there!: In my opinion the only chapters worth reading are chapters12,13,14 and15. My biggest complaint about this book is that most of the chapters were boring. Chapter 2 shows an ostrich walk cycle, chapter 6 shows fighting skunks and chapter 8 shows a talking grave. I prefer "Flash 5 Cartooning" and "Flash Cartoon Animation: Learn From The Pros" over this book.
0	Is book true?: In the very first chapter the motion picture frame of war coverage on the Roer river in Germany, it shows the dates1942-1943, but the invasion of Europe never happend until June1944. Please explain.
1	Not Just Brokaw: I was terrifically moved by this recording, and Tom Brokaw was the least of it. The supporting cast really throws themselves into the letters from The Greatest Generation. Nothing is hokey or excessive, but the honest human sentiment is tough to resist.By contrast, Tom Brokaw sounds like he's phoning in his part of the script. But he has comparatively little to do here. The heavy lifting is done by the professional narrator and actors. A stunner. It's impossible to recommend this edition too highly.
0	Don't be fooled by the preview: I saw the preview for this movie and thought it'd bepretty funny. The Napolean Dynamite scene is one of thehighlights,and that occurs in the first scene. Unfortunately,it's all downhill from there. A big chunk of the movie isparodies of Meet the Parents and Meet the Fockers. Tryingto parody a classic comedy is like going to karaoke night andtrying to sing a Celine Dion song. At best, it's tolerable.Worst case scenerio, well.... you get the idea. Nowhere nearas funny as the Scary Movie movies.
0	Unrated?: I'm tired of all these movies claiming to be the Unrated Version and not offering a single thing that wouldn't be included without exception in a PG-13 movie. Add to that only seven or eight decent laughs in the whole movie and I'm pretty ticked-off. Explaining the spoofs would actually be funnier than the movie, so I won't do it.Tried and true spoof formula is not properly hashed out in cheap attempt to cash-in on quarter-of-a-century craze(Airplane1980). Top Secret, Hot Shot, Hot Shot Part Deux and Not Another Teen Movie are much examples of this (art) form.Might have given it two stars if they left the Unrated off the box.A lot more of Josh Meyers might have helped.
0	A very, very bad movie: I recently witnessed this car crash of a movie. I usually like parodys but this movie was boring and unfunny.
0	One of the worst out there.: Date Movie is from two of the six writers of Scary Movie, apparently they chose the two worst because the movie fails to generate laughter. A few chuckles here and there but that's all.Date Movie is a spoof of romantic comedies. Simply that idea sounds good right? The writers had alot to work with, but they failed miserably. Alyson Hannigan plays the main character, Julia Jones. Personally, not a big fan of her comedy. Now, Eddie Griffin, Jennifer Coolidge and Fred Willard can be quite hilarious but none of that is portrayed in this flop.This might be enjoyed by some, but only a few. For me, a big comedy fan, it was pretty bad in general.I actually watched it at the theaters and, my friends, it was the biggest waste of ten dollars in my life! It is now out on dvd and someone will have to pay me to watch it again...Ok maybe not pay me but at least pay for the movie.One measly star *
0	Torture to watch: I went to see this but it was not by choice. I went on a "field trip" with my co-workers and this was the movie that won the vote.I am all for parodies (like "Saturday Night Live") but this movie went overboard. So does all the Scary Movies (I don't like these either). Do yourself a favor and skip this movie. Get yourself a real "Date Movie".
0	always laugh at these parody movies...but not this one...: The movie was funny the first, oh lets say about maybe the first 20-40 minutes. After that the movie is garbage. The humor and mocking was so dis-tasteful and a little offensive. The cat in the bathroom, "dead mrs.jones", the little jokes by the bachellor's parents, the bizarre family relationships, and the mock-sexual references to sex.I was very surprised at myself when i viewed the film. I hardly laughed and didnt laugh when I needed. Like I said I totally love these not another teen movie, scary movie type films...but Date Movie is pure garage. The humor is so awful and the mockery sucks tooBottom line: Horrible movie...never watching it again.
0	Dated and Dull: This is waaay before the age of personal trainers. Not only is their a small amount of bare skin, but the bare skin they show ain't worth seein'. This stuff got better in the 80s, when there was ample supply of attractive, and less inhibited women.
0	Worst movie in history: Where to start? This thing is so bad that it is a disgrace to bad melodrama. The plot is so predictable it is sickening. This movie wasn't even released until after Harry Potter was released.
1	great: These are authentic Ray-Ban aviator glasses and they look amazing on an average person's face even though they say they are large. the only thing i don't like it that the lens aren't a non-see through green, depending on the lighting, people can see your eyes, this happens about % of the time. outside of that they are amazing glasses and look great.
1	Tony B -- New Chairman of the Board: If Sinatra was considered the Chairman of the Board, Tony Babino will be considered President and CEO of the company. From the opening chord of this CD, you'll be very, very impressed with Tony B's powerhouse vocals. He belts out the standard, "I've Got The World On A String" with a livelier arrangement, to a heartfelt rendition of "And I Love Her". If you think he might be another cover artist, you'll be wrong. Tony B writes his own songs as well. He wrote 4 of the14 tracks on this CD. Some of his own compositions like "50 Years" and "Sentimental Heartstrings" are better than some standards. This is a superb CD. You'll definitely, without a doubt, enjoy this CD. As the title suggests...you'll be "Swingin' Around with Tony B." for a long time to come.
1	Fun Family Film!: I love Cary Grant and Sophia Loren in this fun movie. The kids have an adventure living in a houseboat as opposed to living in an apartment in D.C.
1	Houseboat: This movie is a real delight. It is better than I remembered it as a child (my priorities were different). This plays out as a predictable romantic comedy but great fun anyway. No heavy plot here. As Grants housekeeper, Loren helps Grant to change his priorities, be less of a jerk, and bond with his children. This takes place on a leaky houseboat that sometimes breaks loose and floats down river. Grants dry humor and wit is great fun to watch. Loren is the Italian beauty (thought she was ugly when I was a child)that falls in love with Grant and brings the family together.
1	a very meaningful and entertaining movie: Saw the bachelor in the cinema,It did not fail to keep me smiling and laughing through the whole show.it show that money really can't get you true love.It is a guy sincerelyty that had touch the girl's heart.And at the last part of the movie when one whole bunch of brides chasing after the guy in the movie ,boy it was a real fancinating moment I ever seen,never had I seen such phenomenon ever.After all this is really a good movie to keep you entertain for two hours.worth watching.
0	Not much redeeming value: I don't mind implausible stories, but only if the film makers can pull it off. I was sad to discover that Chris O'Donnell can't act. I hadn't noticed before because he was well cast in a few other roles, but fortunately never had to carry a story. Part of the problem might go to the director. In fact the director is highly suspect. The timing was off and there is no evidence that the man in charge had any clear view of what he wanted to bring out in the characters or storyline. I was sorry I spent the money on the rental. Don't bother.
0	Difficult Viewing: This film is difficult to watch for many reasons. It is below average both artistically and technically. The film is a classic of its genre but for me HUSBANDS and WOMAN UNDER THE INFLUENCE are much better as films. [Note how the excessive laughter in FACES is annoying and unrealistic whilst in HUSBANDS it is natural and enjoyable.]
1	Old protest music by an old hippy. Definitely not country music.: This is a compilation of songs published on other records. It is still good. Writing a protest song was and is just Country Joe McDonald’s way of saying hello. If you are interested in the 60s or the Vietnam War this is worth considering. The most known song on this album, The Fixing to Die Rag, is less raucous than the Woodstock version of that song and still a good version, with the advantage that I can play this one for the grand kiddies without their grandmother going ballistic. For a long time this album was only available at great cost but now it has been republished at a reasonable price and is worth considering.
0	Sorry I bought it.: Less than three months after purchase, it's in the shop; an authorized repair center. Picture started "snapping" 'till no more picture. They replaced the picture tube and something else. I took it home. Then, it started displaying flickering white lights across the top of the screen and a vertical rectangular discoloration on the left side of the screen. They've been working on it for a week ...
0	Refund: This has to be one of the worst movies I have seen. What a waste of talent & money. One has to wonder what someone was thinking when this was made. I could only stand to watch half of it.. Don't waste your time & money.
0	Hard to follow: My husband and I watched this over the weekend. We were both very lost for about the first 25 minutes. Finally we watched the trailer to see if it was worth watching the rest of it. Watching the trailer helped - but not completely.This is by far - NOT our favorite movie of all time.
1	Coconutheads: I've followed The Coconutheads since the early nineties as they've performed throughout south Florida. Their live performance would make a great album too! Val and Greg have a have an almost telepathic connection on stage... their saxophonist (Nicky, I think) is outrageous, mixing in jazzy, moody tones with great skill. The band has had some personnel changes, but the core members have stayed intact, although I miss the live drummer.
1	great product: it's the best lube i've used so far, just a bit expensive and that's the only thing wrong with it
1	Good Product - Stains can be dealt with: I also found this to be a good product and also originally found it to stain any fabric it came in contact with. However, when I contacted Pjur Customer Service, they suggested I try OxiClean or a similar formulation. That did in fact get out the stains.
0	It is greasy: I bought this because of the men's health endorsement. My wife and I used it a few times and then desisted. It's ok for intercourse but not other activities.
0	There are better lubes by FAR!: We did not like this lube. It was not slick enough for our purposes and was very watery. There are much better lubes out there for the money. It also stung per my wife, so we will not try this again.
1	Love it!: i LOVED this movie! i watched it in my English class and LOVED it! it was soo beautiful and i had to buy it because it was so awesome. you never get bored, it has stuff for everyone in it. whether you like Romance, Action, Humor...it is all in there! i really enjoyed it =]
1	The definitive Romeo & Juliet!: Italian director Franco Zeffirelli did an outstanding job of bringing Shakespeare's romantic tale to life. It is THE definitive version of Romeo & Juliet, in my opinion. The fact that the actors were so close to the age of the star crossed lovers adds realism and freshness to the story.Shakespeare's words flow so naturally that you forget that it is a classic play and just get lost in the story. The cinematography is beautifully done and the wonderful customes are a treat for the eyes!You will enjoy this movie ... again, and again ... I highly recommend it!
1	Romeo & Juliet: Love at First Sight: Sure I only watched this because it was assigned for English, but I ended up liking it. Most other15 year-olds don't like Shakespeare, but this is really good! I liked that they had the orignal Shakespearian language. I haven't seen the newer version of Romeo & Juliet, so I can't compare the two. I really recommend this movie to anyone. I sure would watch it again, even if it wasn't mandatory! It's an instant classic, and a must have for anyone. You wil love this movie. My parents love it too, it brings back a lot of memories for them (yes, good ones). All age groups would like this, except maybe ones younger than my age group (mid-teens). You won't regret getting (or at least renting it) so come on people, give this a try! Enjoy!!!!!
0	Romeo & Juliet: The only reason I watched this movie is because it was a required see from a class in college I was enrolled in.
1	the fight over music: Holloway's book is a wonderful introduction to what the history of western political philosophy says about the role of music in shaping people's character. The belief that music has a role in forming the character has always been a controversal stance, starting with Plato, and remains one still today. One only has to be reminded of Allan Bloom's chapter on Rock music and the reaction that section provoked shows how powerful this theme remains today. Liberals (ancient and modern, capitalist or not) don't like the idea that music plays a role in character formation.. and what Holloway's book does shows the reader what the big stars of western philosophy has to say on this subject. Holloways argues by ignoring the power of music in the formation of character of the young especially, contemporary society and the music it has bread.. has lead to extremes both in music and people's character.. and both for the worse.
0	But They're Not On an Airplane!: I was extremely disappointed with Airplane II: The Sequel. The first one was great, and I'd watch it over and over again. But since I've seen the sequel, it hasn't been as funny. The sequel's pretty unoriginal and the replayed humor detracts from its predessor it's the same love story, and a smattering of redone scenes. (Rember the old woman who hung herself?) I wouldn't buy this one. In fact, I wouldn't even spend the money to rent it on DVD; save yourself a few bucks, rent it on VHS.
0	More Groans Than Laughs: Weak, derivative, and thoroughly unfunny - classic example of a studio cashing in with the old Good Movie Rehash. (...). Although what's funny and what isn't is often a matter of opinion, the element of surprise is what defines humor. We laugh when the unexpected happens. But having seen it all before in the original, nothing - and I mean NOTHING - is funny in Airplane 2. Even the new jokes are variations on a theme. Save your money and watch Airplane! twice.
0	Strictly for Seattle radicals (all others need not apply).: This movie is in black and white (better still, in black and red!) and I don't mean colorwise. It's your standard politically-correct hagiography where good guys ooze beatitude, bad guys reek evil, and if you don't root for the former, you belong with the latter. Like history told this way? If so, then you're gonna love it; if not, at least you'll get some laughs.Mind you, it's not that I object the fake look, dubbed dialogue, hammy overacting or holier-than-thou attitude of everyone concerned in this dated political flick from the sixties; I mean, we were all pretty much ridiculous ourselves back then. But Joan Baez's awful lyrics and worst wailing tear apart the movie's only redeeming asset: Ennio Morricone's beautiful music score. Now that's a true crime!So you've been warned!
1	A Spark for Social Reform: The purpose of this book is to heighten awareness about consumerism and ultimately bring about dramatic change in our society. The audience is primarily Americans, though the book has been well received in several foreign countries. De Graaf and his associates present powerful evidence from a wide collection of sources. Their argument is persuasive and well documented. They address environmental, social, financial, spiritual, physical and mental indicators of health in our society. Affluenza has made me more aware of how I spend my money, time and intellectual effort by highlighting some of our societies weaknesses. I enjoyed reading the book because it made me question some of my practices. The authors throw down the gauntlet by challenging many "American principles." Overall, the argument is sound and effective, if a bit dramatic at times. A copy of should come free with every new BMW, satellite TV dish and MBA degree. America needs it.
1	Love this movie!: I love that I can find the older movies here at Amazon. I have bought several from different sellers and all have been great! I just love Spenser Tracy and this old b&w is one of my FAV's
0	Not Just "Borderline" Terrible--It Is Terrible!: Thank your "Lucky Star" if you miss this one. This movie is so bad I don't know where to start. I don't like Madonna to begin with. It's bad enough that I have to hear her belt out her crappy pop ditties on the radio and see her face plastered on magazine covers, but this so-called "movie" is quite possibly the worst thing she's unleashed on the public. It's even worse than "Body of Evidence" and that's saying something. Maybe I'm prejudiced against Madonna, but I was willing to give this movie a chance...boy, do I regret it. I want my two hours back.
0	Madonna is an embarrassment...: This movie is So very bad on so many different levels, that it is almost beneath any serious movie lover or critic to waste time viewing it. Madonna is at her all time low, and it is a low that few stars ever reach. She is a terribly bad actress and this time out, she made even her die-hard fans cringe in embarassment for her. Simply put, there is no guesswork here...there is not a redeaming quality in this movie. The acting, script, direction, tone, pace, etc., are all at an extremely shoddy level, and DAMN is she getting painful to look at. The only comfort comes in the knowledge of the FACT that this movie was completely shunned by not only critics but by the public as well. Even Madonna's legion of fans couldn't get her out of this one. It bombed on every level.
1	Great Movie, But...: The storyline was superb. Rupert was great. But Madonna...what were you thinking??? Her accent annoyed me throughout the whole movie. Is she American??? Is she English??? The cross between sounds Australian which is irritating. Apart from Madonna's terrible acting, this movie is held together pretty well.
0	Bad: The video kept timing out. The screen would go black or multi color. I had to wait for the movie to restart every10 minutes
1	An amazing fun MOM book: This book was wonderful. I am a SAHM. I thought that Meredith did an excellent job on the book. I loved all the relationships and the e-mails going back and forth. What a refreshing format. This wasn't just a fun book though, it was deep and caused me to think deeper about my life and my relationships with my husband, kids, and other moms. I read this book in about a day. It was too good to put down.shannon
0	Not the Planet of the Apes: This has everything to do with the recent movie and nothing to do with the real book. The real book had messages that were really lost in the recent film, it was close to a modern day Gulliver's Travels, raising questions about how we treat animals, our science and our society.This will no doubt be fairly close to the recent film, which is okay hokum. Excepting the massive holes in the plot of the recent movie... How did horses arrive on the planet? Where were the non-chimps on the station etc?
1	Wonderful perspective shift!: After reading the Ophelia books and the studies on the many and varied problems teenage girls face, this was a wonderful and refreshing perspective. Teenage girls who are self-confidant, not worried about pleasing others with who they are, eloquent, etc. How encouraging! I'm looking forward to reaping some of these benefits of homeschooling...
0	???: Don't even remember watching it, could not have been very good! Whoever created this should find another career. Best of luck!
0	HORRIBLE, WASTE OF TIME!: This book is one of the worst books I've ever read. None of the research from the Bible is even remotely close to the context it was written in. Can Katz even do a reasonable job at researching information? It doesn't even deserve one star.
0	Women leave for all the same reasons: I wasn't looking for a book on why men leave... but on the fear of commitment. I have enjoyed this author's other book about Zen and falling in love... and browsing the first pages intrigued me.I will never understand why anyone thinks this is just a masculine problem. I think that certain people, for whatever reason, value their own personal freedom above anything else, yet everyone, of course, would like to have a loving partner to go through life with. I wish this book had more insight into how TWO people like this, male, female... whatever... can find freedom within the confines of relationship.
0	Dont Bother.............Wait for it to play on local cable: i loved the first mummy movie and had very high expectations for the second, even though i missed it in the theaters. The day it was released on dvd, i ran out to get it to find my local store sold out. My roomate however manged to snag it for his collection and upon watching it that nite, was glad that fate stopped me from buying a truly overrated , summer popcorn flick.special effects were a plenty but def. less striking than the first one, the computerized scorpion king at the end was almost as bad as the computerized satan at the end of SPAWN. the story was kinda weak. But its a sequel i guess.Dont waste your time. rental only or wait for it on TNT.
0	pretty bad: If you loved the first one, this one might be worth a rent from the video store, but i thought that they were both pretty bad.
0	This should have been a good movie...: but it really wasn't. The returning characters display none of the character traits that made them entertaining in the first movie. The movie simply careens, in a nearly plot free fashion, from one set-piece of computer enhanced combat to another. Now, I like a good, violent action movie as much as the next guy, but this one wasn't good. Watching it reminded me of watching somebody play the "Mortal Kombat" type video games of the 90's. If the producers had spent half of what went toward special effects on a better script, this movie could have lived up to its predecessor.
1	The Mummy Returns: I enjoyed the movie very much although some of the computer bad guys were a bit over the top. The fact that Oded Fehr (Ardeth Bay)has more scenes helped alot. This film is entertaining and also answers many questions left over from the1st film.
0	Forgot to mention this...: But Universal did at the very least included DTS! to this Blu-ray! as well as the first movie.By the way, this movie on the whole. Was not very good and was a bit way too campy.
0	the mummy returns: I find it very hard to believe that some people enjoyed this movie so much that they gave it a five star rating. If this gets five stars, what do good films get?!. This makes no sense. The film is poor. Hre are a few thoughts...Acting: I've seen better acting in fifth grade musicals.Plot: Plot, what plot?Dialog: Laughable.Character Development: The characters are so static that I felt like I was watching a soap opera set in1930s Egypt in which many things arbitrarily exploded.I will praise this film in one way: it is better than Hollow Man (but then again, sitting in an empty parking lot watching a dumpster for 90 minutes is more satisfying than watching Hollow Man). In closing, my solemn hope is that the mummy won't return again.
0	ryan hickneys mummy review: this moview could of been much better. it was as dumb as dumb can get. the only good thing about it is that the actors played good. i am sure the director was feeling low when he found the rating in the theaters. BYE
0	Don't buy this DVD: Unless you want to line Universal's pocket, I'd advise you to stay away from this video.Don't get me wrong though, I like the movie. It's pretty good escapist entertainment. I don't try to read to much into such movies. It was fun. But Universal is most likely going to release this title in an Ultimate Edition package just like the last one. They also created Ultimate Editions for American Pie, Meet Joe Black and a few others. So if you like this movie wait for the Ultimate Edition.
1	Great Special Effects: Great photography and outstanding special effects. A move to see over and over just to enjoy the visual presentation.
0	It stunk: This movie isnt even worth rental.Everthing was boring and the mummy was fully regenerated in the first 30 minutes.It wasnt evenworth the one star it got.
0	What a waste of time: This refers to the Australian Region 4 Collector's Edition. The picture quality is excellent. The DTS soundtrack (yes, this is standard on the R4 DVD unlike the R1)is of reference quality and quite outstanding in dynamic range (especially in the water-wall sequence). Unfortunately, the film was a total waste of time and I think studios should be paying audiences to watch films like this. No where near as good as the original -very formulaic and it felt almost like a cartoon with its over reliance on CGI. I scanned through most of the movie and I feel sorry for everyone who thinks this is worth buying. Even if a free copy was offered I would not accept -because I would never watch it again! And the bonus materials! Who cares about this when the film is so pathetic. I hope I'm not a minority who thinks film substance is still more important than its technical merits. I have invested in home theatre to enjoy films not gunfire, car chases and explosions.
1	Good short history: Publisher: Wilson's Creek National Battlefield Foundation; 4th Edition (1992)Language: EnglishASIN:1-881366-01-4170 pages, maps, pictures, indexI found this book in the bookstore at Wilson's Creek and bought it immeadlty. Ed Bearss' narration captures the immediacy of the situation, placing you on the line. This small book will not disappoint the reader there and will convey solid information about the battle. The balance between detail and narration is maintained throughout the book. Neither takes over and we end with a short but very solid history.
0	OK as a monocular, not a binocular: I could not get these to form a single image of a star or planet because the two tubes are not exactly parallel. I do not know whether that was a quality control issue of the pair I had, or the overall quality specification is so poor that misalignment is typical. Mine went back. A properly aligned pair would be a considerable bargain. If you buy these, buy them from a place with a good return policy. Keep the packaging and invoice.
0	RE: Mission Impossible: By and large, the movie fails because it strays too far from the premise of the TV show and ventures into007 and Bourne territory.No IMF team, no suspense, poor story.The TV series is far superior.
0	Impossible: Your impossible misson? Trying to watch this movie, and finding anything comprehensible about the plot. Tom Cruise said in an interview that it IS possible to follow the plot (but, obviously there is a problem if he has to point that out!). But does that mean one has to rewind certain sections five times, to get all the dialogue details? Movies are not like books. In theaters, you can't flip back five pages, to refresh in your mind who a certain character is. So things should be spelled out with CLARITY. Something this film is woefully lacking. Having said that, DePalma is a great stylist-director, and as a music video, this isn't a total loser. But as a movie, it is.
0	Such shit: This movie is the worst of modern movie making: big budget, small art. I couldn't wait for it to be over.
0	I was dissappointed: Fans of the TV series should be dissappointed and angry that a good show has gotten into the wrong hands. There is none of the intrigue or ingenuity that was so integral to the series. The movie could have and should have been made under a different title. Why was it necessary to spoil the memory of a great TV series with this nonsense?Without revealing any of the plot, let me just say that the denouement is particularly awful, in that it puts one of the main characters from the TV show in a very negative light. This particular plot element was completely unnecessary and un-called for. No reason to see this at all.
1	Nice Family Drama: This is a nice family drama that explores a son's conflicted relationship with his father. It shows the sad consequences that result when father's spend much time trying to become rich and famous and calously neglect to care for and love their sons.
1	Get this book and go!: The People's Guide is a pure delight, a labor of love about Mexico. It's a travel book that is actually fun to read. It's also full of useful information about just about everything; how to travel, where to stay, how to stay healthy, how to deal with the law, some basics on the language, and much more. And every bit of it feels like advice from someone who has learned it all through years of experience, some of it painful, most of it joyful.What it is not is a book listing all the hotels, restaurants, stores, museums, and so forth. (There is a short section - The Best of Mexico - with specific suggestions, but it's just a starting point.) If your approach to travel is as footloose and unplanned as the authors, this may be the only book you need. If you like a little more structure, you will want to supplement it with traditional guidebooks for the areas you plan to visit.
1	Book was a marvel of technical details and fiction: Guy Durham masterfully tells a spy tale with grity details of the processes along the way. He includes a myriad of interesting characters and plot twists in a live-action way, Bravo!
0	Brittle Fail: These cases are super brittle, I bought one recently from this seller, and in the past on ebay. In both instances the cases have been tough fits. The cases are SUPER brittle and will more than likely crack on you while screwing them on (like mine did). I am pretty upset at the cost of them for how cheap they are. I now have a nice transparent case with a huge crack down the middle and a DVD drive that wont open. .... not worth it
1	Just what I was looking for!: This book is full of many wonderful ideas on how to achieve your own 'white' space. The effect is fresh and romantic, and somehow soothing. The images within are simply elegant. Lovely, and highly recommended!
1	Alarm works when power is out!: A lot of the battery backup alarm clocks only provide for backup of the settings. If the power is out when the alarm is suppose to go off, you're out of luck. This one is different. It has a backup "mini-buzzer" alarm that will go off at the set alarm time even if you have the alarm set to radio. I'm in a situation where I cannot afford to wake up late. It's comforting knowing I don't have to worry about the power being out and the alarm not sounding.
1	WING FLY HIGH !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!: Love this cd to bad it was the last Wings recored, all were gems the lp did not far good on release but it was still great.
1	Yes, It Is Better: Of all McCartney's lost albums, this is the one that most richly deserves to be found. Old Siam Sir sits with other forgotten Mccartney classic rockers such as Girls' School, Soily and The Mess all of which fit neatly with the best Rock and Roll he wrote for that other group (in many ways they are rawer than most of what he wrote for them). Arrow Through Me is one of those delicate pieces that McCartney writes that somehow manage to rock in a subtle way. The Rockestra highlights work well on this album, but are perhaps better on Concert for Kampuchea. The generally stripped down sound of this album allows the listener to appreciate the musicianship of Wings Mark 3. Give it a listen, you want be disappointed, particularly if you like the better moments on the Mccartney album
1	Excellent: All the Nancy Drew books are excellent - perfect to develop a 8 or 9 year olds love for reading. The stories are all so interesting. We cherish our mother daughter routine of reading these books together every night. Also the characters are wholesome. There is a line drawn between good and evil. Some of the more contemporary books like Junie B. Jones have main characters that I would never want my daughter to emulate with bad attitudes, etc. Nancy Drew is not afraid of ANYTHING or ANYONE and is always finding adventure while solving mysteries.
1	Story of Saab as told by a European.: The author has several automotive books to his credit and it shows. In his history of this classic car, told from a British perspective, the text is easy to read, and the author displays a thorough understanding of how cars work. There are plenty of excellent photos, some in color but mostly not. I learned *why* the ignition key is on the floor (safety feature), and got further insights into this small company's heritage as an innovator, e.g. how, with the 96, they had an extremely aerodynamic car rivalled only by the Citroen DS, or how they insisted, for safety reasons, on using heavier sheet metal than other makers, explaining its enduring status among automotive brands.
0	disturbing: We received this book as a gift. I like the photo illustration concept but the book content itself is disturbing. There are so many better books out there to spend your money on.
0	BEWARE: This is not an appropriate book for children! As a child, I myself found it highly disturbing. Although the pictures are cute, I would never allow my child to read it.
0	Magic Thumb Tip: The thumb is very small (more for a child than an adult) and you could not fit any cloth inside to do any type of trick. Would absolutely not recommend this product at all.
1	Meooooooooww: When I read this title I thought it was going to be a funny story but WOWWW was it so much more. This is the sexiest story I have every read. Dammmmmm
1	A classic which keeps you guessing.: The only thing really wrong with Morse is that he smokes too much. If you want a really good read in your mysteries, here it is.
1	Cute - I used them to decorate a cake.: I used these to decorate my boyfriend's birthday cake. I have to admit, they were a bigger hit than my cake! lol!
1	Yes, good movies are still being made!!!!!: With today's current crop of movies, it is easy to think that quality films that make you think might have gone the way of the dodo. However, The Insider is a BIG exception to the rule. Don't let the long running time or the fact that it may seem like any other A & E documentary discourage you. This movie is potboiler that keeps you glued to the screen and howling at every the injustice of it all.One of the greatest compliments for this movie would have to be the fact that I watched it with five of my friends who could care less about current events or journalistic integrity, yet all of them sat through every single minute of it absolutely riveted to the screen.It is kind of discouraging seeing the self-censorship and the "chilling effect" on the media that's taken place since the events of the film. However, the film ends on a high note and is well worth watching if you enjoy great cinema!
1	Great Suspensful Drama: This is a great movie starring russell crowe and al pacino. It was well worthy of it's oscar nomination for best picture. The movie builds with tension as the it moves along. The DVD has some great features and great picture quality. The movie is over 2 hours but as with any great film time is not an issue. This is well worth the money to buy.
1	the best: i sometimes think of that final list of the finest movies i've ever seen. after much soul searching and viewing films for over 50 years, i narrowed it down to amadeus, private ryan, manchurian candidate (frank sinatra), high noon and no country. after everything shakes out, THE INSIDER would have to top the list. acting, directing, music, script and subject matter. i just wish it was on blu ray.
1	Riveting: Man was I upset when this thing ended after just three hours. For anyone who's ever worked in a big glass skyscraper this film is truly cathartic. I think it is too narrow to focus on the journalistic or the tobacco-industry elements of The Insider. Like HEAT before it, Mann's film is a highly dramatized portrayal of ethics in the modern world. Truly a remarkable film that earns everything it asks for from the audience. On a lesser note, I also think it is something really unique when big-budget Hollywood productions such as this one eschew explosions and spaceships to focus on telling a human story. Cheesy as it may sound, I believe a film like this is much closer to gargantuan filmaking than... well let's justs say GLADIATOR.
0	Pretty much a waste of time: The story itself, which is based on real events, is interesting but the filmmakers made it into a weak feature film. There is too much unnecessary information and the "60 minutes" peoples' portrayal is too harsh. Some scenes are repeated during the film and the overall dialogue can [at times] put you to sleep.I give this film two stars instead of one because of Russel Crowe's superb acting.
0	Not What I Expected: This books has loads of information, but it is in black and white and the fonts make it difficult to hold one's attention. I would not purchase this again.
1	to dream of love: This movie is unique and beautiful. Especially the character Tom (played by Jeremy Davies).Still reeling from its beauty, which really, was in all the little details. It was made like a dream, some characters over the top, some more real than real.See it if you can.
0	The Emperor Has No Clothes: Too bad there is not a rating of MINUS-stars. This film is garbage; boring, pretentious, and meaningless. Perhaps other reviews can attach their own fantasies and for them this DOA film may say something. But I found it an irritating waste of time. When a script and the characters within it have no definition, no relevance, and no entertainment value - watching it becomes either self-torture or an exercise in pretending that it serves some arty vision. This is the only time that Mel Gibson let me down. I understand he donated his services to this production and, in that case, he was very much overpaid.
1	great buy, great hair and skin!: I bought this for myself, and upon using it just once the difference in my skin and hair was obvious. No itching or dryness! I promptly bought another for my mother- she is in her 80s and has said this has helped her skin and hair so much. We gave them as gifts to many people in08, and every one of them has gone on to buy one to give as a gift to someone they love too. Honestly; easy to install, easy to use, instant results- great value for money!
1	My Philips Norelco Epilator: I was really pleased after using my new epilator, it definitely exceeded my expectations and I don't need to epilate again for at least a month easily. I had a Braun epilator earlier I had used for years which was much more expensive but I must say the Philips epilator is as good, if not better.
1	Awsome: I love this product it's awsome. I have to admit it is painful a little the first time, but after that the pain goes away. you'll love the feeling of your skin after you use it, very smooth and clean. I totally recommend it.
1	First epilator I've used: I'm not sure how this compares to other epilators, but I think it does a pretty good job for the price. It doesn't get all my hair out, but it gets 95% of it after a few passes. I think with any epilator, it's gonna hurt, but since the hair doesn't grow back as fast, and comes back finer it is sooo worth it. The more you use it, the less it hurts, so don't give up, it gets better! Also, I've noticed that even with occasional use (about 6 times a year), about 25% of my hair has stopped growing back, and what has come back is much finer. Unfortunately, I have such fair skin that I need to remove the hair either by epilating or waxing since you can still see the folicle after shaving! The epilator is much more financially and environmentally better than having to wax for me.
1	Looking for the perfect gift for the man who has everything?: Here it is. I purchased this for my Dad, 79 years young. Finding anything for him, that he hasn't seen, heard or done is very difficult. Imagine my surprise when he sent me a note stating this was the BEST gift he'd received in a long time! I also bought him "the Evolution of Useful Things"... same message! Both are super-duper gifts!
0	To engineer is human - I engineered a new beverage coaster!: I purchased this book at the Duke University bookstore, after the recommendation from a professor at another institution.Petroski's prose is extremely dense and verbose. His style consists of run-on sentences which require several readings. Even if it is technically (grammatically) correct, it is extremely difficult to read. The subject matter is dry to begin with, however, Petroski does nothing to liven it. I am an engineer also, and am not threatened by the technical information (admittedly lifted from his students' term papers). I have chemical engineering textbooks that read like a novel. Hopefully the courses he teaches are clearer than this muddled prose.Petroski is certainly an engineer. He has engineered an elegant method of making money from saps like us. I successfully engineered Petroski's book into a beverage coaster to help drown the sorrows of wasting $14 on this book.
0	Save yourself the time...: The book itself was in good condition and promptly shipped.... however, the content of the book leaves a lot to be desired. What could have been accomplished in one chapter is drawn out repeatedly to cover 200 pages. Very boring. Overall message is one of merit, but too much repetition.
0	Had SO much potential....: I tried really hard to like this book. The first couple of chapters were really promising, but then the author suddenly lost track of where she was going. Stilted broken part-way descriptive sentences. No serious romance going on. I really didn't care if they ended up together. I suggest Karen Marie Moning for really great time travel romance, or for the serious time travel enthusiast - Diana Gabaldon's Outlander. Both authors have never written a dud. This was definitely a dud, no offense intended to the author of course. It just didn't happen.
0	I liked the backcover blurb, but...: This book was romantic drivel. It made me think it was pulled directly from the pages of an early1970s Harlequin. While wonderful at the time, this book will leave today's modern romance reader cold. Latter Day Saints, this is a book you can sink your teeth into.
0	Don't waste your money: Although they appeared to be working (they glowed, and we'd hear the occasional ZAP) it didn't take 6 months before one of them completely stopped glowing, and they made no dent at all in the mosquito population - the reason we bought them. Not worth it at all.
0	Bug Zapper: I was hoping for something with more power to actually zap the bugs but this one does not. I even purchased two sets. The light does cause the bugs to swarm around it but it does not have enough power to actually kill the bugs.When it is on the light setting it isn't enough light to even guide you along a path. I am very disappointed in it.We will be purchasing an electric bug zapper soon to replace these.
0	Poor stitching, doesn't hold up: I recently purchased 8 of these bras and although I loved the fit, I'm afraid that 4 out of 8 have had an identical problem in stitching at the center top part of the bra. All of them have unraveled stitching during the first wash causing the underwire to poke out. All were hand washed and were hung to dry so I'm afraid it can't be blamed on machines. I'm greatly disappointed
1	Works with AVIC-D3: The new ipods do not charge with the pioneer cable, and this was the solution to the problem. Now my 4th gen nano charges no problem!
1	(3.8)stars still good: This is not like their first two albums but it's still heavy.They don't have the deathcore they had in their first album and some of it in caitiff choir but it's still has the metalcore with brutal breakdowns and more melodic singing i guess.This is kind of like the band a day to remember just not to big with the pop thing.If you own their first two albums just know this,there's more clean singing,nick doesn't have the deathcore growls anymore,and not as brutal but yeah still brutal.So i can't say you might not like this but there's is some good heavy songs is okay.
1	So far - très bon: AS described, but I think you need to know some French before you can use this product effectively.
0	Is it over yet?: After 4 months of trying to plow through this book, I finally gave up on page121 and read the last page. I kept hoping things would get better; The pace would pick up and I might care about these people. To no avail. A thourough disappointment. start to abbreviated finish.
0	Crap: with all the add on to this game a simple versus DLC that allows you to play up to four or even two players in your house (split screen) would be good, but no they made it online only or one player so no internet no fun. it's not worth it, buy any other burnout except this one. and if you want to have fun wreaking cars and people get (Saints Row The Third) or (Grand Theft Auto) you can drive around getting into all sorts of trouble. Not a bad idea the open land driving but we see that in the GTA's this is Burnout the open land should be the addition
1	You're Gonna This Book: This book is a must read!!!! but not unless you've read City Of Masks and City of Stars. Hoffman creates and incredible world in (unfortunately) the last installment of this AMAZING series. You'll want to stay in Talia forever. This book had the perfect combination of love, adventure, suspense, and wit. For those of you who read the first 2 books to me City of Flowers was very shocking but in a good way. *****
0	We Are The World meets Journey: When the cast of We Are The World and the band members of Journey had illegitimate children they named them Doug and the Mystics. Doug and the Mysics successfully create Prozaic induced songs about what seem to be important issues. Later these songs proove to have no real central concept or meaning.
0	TV goes out after 90 days: We spent $90 on this tv. It worked fine for 95 days or so. Then the tv goes out. You push the power button and nothing happens. We have tried different outlets and everything. And guess what, it only has a 90 day warranty on labor. And the labor is $60!!! Don't buy it.
1	Faith in this Movie: Nortan (Fight Club; American History X), Elfman (Sitcom "Dharma and Greg"), and Stiller (Meet the Parents) light it up in this warm-hearted comedy about 3 friends from grade school who haven't seen each other in year, now thrown back together when Elfman comes running back into their lives. Nortan and Stiller, now clergymen, (Nortan a Catholic Priest, Stiller a Jewish Rabbi) both find the old friendship they once knew in their beloved tom-boyish beauty of a friend Elfman. But throughout it all, there is denial, lying, antitrust, and a passionate love triangle forms. Now who will end up following their faith and who will end up following their hearts? Nortan, Elfman, and Stiller deliver a spectacular and heart gripping performance in this romantic comedy that shouldn't be missed by men nor women alike.
1	Sweet romantic comedy...: Ben Stiller and Edward Norton play best friends Jake and Brian, a rabbi and a priest who are both strong leaders in their congregations. When their friend Anna visits them, both friends fall for her and find themselves questioning their faiths.This is a sweet and often funny movie that is well written and acted by the cast. Religion can be a tough subject to base a comedy around, but Keeping the Faith does pretty well. The plot itself seems to unwind a bit near the end, but Ben Stiller and Edward Norton keep it afloat pretty well.This is a pretty good movie, so I recommend it for a Saturday afternoon.
1	Love it!: This has always been one of my favorite movies. It is one of my favorite roles for all of the actors, especially Edward Norton, but they all did beautifully. It was refreshing to see Ben Stiller in a more serious, yet still comedic movie.
1	A good collection but......: This collection features some of their hit singles plus one new track "Desperado", it includes the #1 single in Italy "Movin' On" which was originally released in1984, the beautiful ballads "Dreamland Paradise", "Leaving Now" and "Smile", and the amazing "Excessive Love". All the other tracks are pop-dance songs. They did many other songs that are not included here as the pop-jazz "Broadway", the beautiful semi new age ballad "Shine" and many others.
1	After 21 Years....: ...I finally saw this film again and it wasn't too bad, though typical of the time it came out, as far as sound, photography, SPFX and acting, though the four leads were great: Randy Quaid, the beautiful Kate Capshaw (this was only her second film), Max Von Sydow and of course Christopher Plummer. It arrived from Amazon just days before Eddie Albert died but I didn't get around to watching it till a few days after that, so it was kinda bittersweet to watch. I could barely recall anything of it since I'd seen it only once at its initial theatrical release so this was a nice reminder. I recommend this to anyone looking for 99 minutes to kill if they've nothing else to do.Unintentional funny moment: When the paramedics try reviving a dead Mrs. Matusik the actress moves a split second before the paddles touch her.
1	Suprisingly enjoyable: "Blow" is a well done film depicting an era. Though the point of "blow" is kind of hard to figure out, it is an interesting movie to watch, and you find yourself mysteriously rooting for Jung as he rises and falls.The best part of this film is the first part detailing Jung's rise to fame, and his doomed relationship with his first girlfriend. The shots of California and the beach are the quintessential way that we all wish it truly were.Somewhat depressing, somewhat amusing, and always entertaining, you won't go wrong adding "Blow" to your collection. Depp is always good in all his roles.
0	DEPP COULDN'T SAVE THIS ONE: This film portrays large scale drug dealers as guerilla marketing experts. It's long on make-up and period costume and short on cool dialogue or good acting. Hispanic actors portray Columbians using exaggerated accents and they appear more middle eastern than latin american. Good cameos by Ray Liotta and Pee-Wee Herman. The film is based on one convict's memoir, and it presents an interesting point or two, but everything in this film has been covered before, in better films.
0	Great movie!: I really liked this movie! They picked the perfect character for Pee Wee Herman to play. I thought the movie was really good except for the constant whinning of his mother! What about me???? What about me??? I't get's really old after awhile listening to her complain! Otherwise I thought it was a great movie! Johnny Depp was real convincing as a drug dealer. My suggestion by this movie!
1	Crime does not pay. No honor among thieves. A very good life lesson based on a true story: The story is interesting and engaging from the beginning till the end.It's a very good life lesson based on a true story. It showed a "big" drug dealer can make tons of money. However it also shows crime does not pay and there is no honor among thieves. They set up each other. They stole from each other, etc.It's absolutely worth viewing.
0	Heavy handed: While the acting, directing, and general storytelling was solid, I thought the movie was little more than a heavy-handed morality play disguised as a self-indulgant biographical exposÉ. Truth is, I just didn't find the characters interesting or sympathetic and the ending made me groan. They probably got funding from the US government to present the anti-drug moral lesson.
0	Hogan's halo hailed on by this half-witted horror...: The first two films were wonderful fun, and worth repeat viewing. I only managed to sit in the theater until the end of this one by mustering great fortitude. Compared to the first two episodes, "Los Angeles" is lamentably lame. Skip it.
0	Please no more!: The third installment of Crocodile Dundee starring a subdued Paul Hogan takes place this time in Los Angeles,where he somehow finds an plot do steal some paintings. The ever lovable guy from 'downunder', is less lovable and more pathetic looking this go around. I know he's getting older, but did this second sequal really need to be made? The script and plot are something not even a t.v. movie of the week would show. Like the old saying, " Don't fix it if it aint broken". Well it's broken, but please Hollywood, don't try and fix it!
0	Not the Buddy Holly I know and love: My husband bought this CD for me during a recent visit to the UK, and I don't like it. I'm a Buddy Holly fan, but sound quality is poor, and it doesn't compare to his later recordings in terms of arrangements and singing style. Not my cup of tea.
0	Pathetic movie feels like a made for TV movie! Rent it first: This movie literally borrows scenes from many action movie. It is full of plot holes...The story is OK. The DVD has OK amount of features. Rent this pathetic movie first(unless you like Treat Williams or B grade action movies!). I would go into details about the many plot holes but that would ruin it for other readers/viewers. Just be sure you rent this movie first before you buy it!
1	Amazing: Camus's novel truley symbolizes the coldness of modern life. He creates one of the great literary characters of all time and paints a powerful image of mankind's true state. The novel makes the reader question their own lapse into the existentialist circle and why it happens. In short, it is one of the classics.
1	read it for your own reaction.: This novel is absurd. This is not arguable. The point of this novel is that you react to it -- you see Meursault and his absurd way of going about life, and you feel the need to change your own.
1	Profound, Poetic, and Disturbing: A terrific read. Very dry, engaging, and clips along at a good pace. I finished it in less than three hours, and felt that I had witnessed part of myself on Camus' stage. M. Meursault is, for the most part, an ordinary person who has been benumbed by a daily existence of "getting by." Finding himself so dulled, that finally, he is a mere spectator in his own life. "Effect" instead of "Cause." The story begins with a death, and ends with a death. In the folds of each is found new life, whether it is his Maman's "fiancee" or Meursault's own rebirth of consciousness in his final minutes. Perhaps through this story, we can all find something of ourselves in M. Meursault, and heed the warning that seems to glare in mile-high neon. Be "Cause." Not "Effect." Get out and LIVE. Live heroically instead of being a spectator or simply "getting by.&quot
1	L'Etranger, The Stranger: I picked up The Stranger expecting the worst. With a sigh I sat down to read it, and about an hour later, I put it down. I sighed again, shrugged and then ate lunch. At dinner, I told my father that I had finished reading it, and my reaction to the text. He grinned and waved his fork. "That's exactly what Camus was writing about." Confused, I read the book again. And this time, I liked it. The more I read it, the easier it was to understand. I felt connected to the characters, and sympathized with the events in thier lives. The Stranger nows has a special space in my bookcase.
1	A Good Classic: I think everybody should read this who likes existentialism. it is a very quick read though. i think it would make a very great movie.
1	goth background research: "and the stranger - the killing of an arab"It was those lyrics in Killing An Arab by The Cure that made me want to read this book. Plus, in high school, I thought I was an existentialist.This story is really interesting and a great book to read if you're at all into the Cure - it's like adding some street cred or something - not really, but I feel somehow more orderly by having read it.It's short, easy to read and gives an interesting view of life - it is written by quite a well known (ie. accessible) philosopher after all. One could call it a nice intro to existentialism or an addition to your goth music research, cuz you know you love to research music.
0	SO overrated: This is a top contender for the worst book ever written. I thought about giving it a tied position with Pamela Anderson's _Star_, but upon reflection I have decided that I would rather read _Star_ again than read _The Stranger_ again, although I would rather be eaten alive by rabid wolverines than do either. This book is so bad that it is painful for me to read it. If I had a time machine, I would pay to have Camus beaten to death on a deserted beach, ultimately preventing this disaster from ever coming into existence.
1	Not existentialist - depressed!: I read The Stranger when I was young but didn't really get much out of it. I recently reread it and was struck by the lack of emotion on the part of the protagonist, Muersault. Forget existentialist - this man was depressed. He has all the hallmarks of it - doesn't care about anything, has no joy in his existence. It doesn't so much bother me that he didn't care about his mother's death; she was older, apparently not in good health and they weren't close. But what does bother me is the casual way he deals with the murder he committed. It seems almost beside the point- the man he killed had done nothing to Muersault justifying the murder. More than anything else, his flat attitude reminded me of the murderers in In Cold Blood. There were some serious mental health issues that this man had.
1	Existentialism at its finest!: The Stranger was a summer reading assignment for my senior year of high school, and I devoured every word of it. Albert Camus should be read by every student of literature,history, and philosophy. His prose is fluid, his style uncompromising. He reflects the lack of definite meaning that life sometimes has. Camus earned his place in the French literary canon. It is time that the American literary canon adds him among their elite as well. I hope to read this novel again, but in French.
1	Great Book, I couldn't put it down: After you get a few chapters into the book, it grabs you. You get so into it that every time you put it down, all you can think about is the book. This was also one of those books that your sad when it ends because you want to read more of it. Good thing there is 2 more! This is a must read for all fantasy and science fiction readers!
1	Good CD dictionary that can be better: This review is for CD version. I agree with most of previous reviewers that this is top notch American English dictionary.Some previous reviewers complained that the new words are not inserted into the main body of the dictionary. This could be a problem for the printed version. For CD version, this is not a problem. When looking up a word, I cannot tell if it is from the original or from the new word list.I do not understnad why the multimedia function is not on the CD. If it uses too much hard disk space, it can be made available from CD, as Random House did. No pronouncing symbols can compare with the real sound.
0	No support for low screen res: The interface may be horrific or it may be brilliant; either way, I wouldn't know as that I am running on a laptop with a vertical resolution of 480 dpi. When running at this resolution, the bottom of the dialogue boxes are chopped off - scroll bars, lists of words, et al - instead of resizing as would be expected of even a sub-par user interface.And tech-support's response to my dilemma? Increase your resolution. Sorry, it's a laptop with a fixed resolution; not an option. Guess I'm stuck with Encarta's less-than-inspiring definitions of words.
1	Excellent Dictionary: I found this dictionary outstanding quality. As a person who's english is not a first language, I love the unlimited variety words and the detailed descriptions of each words. I hoped if the book isn't so big and heavy but I guess it's impossible for this dictonary. I like to recommend to evrybody and I have so. For new buyers, you won't regret. People might think this dictionary is not much different from the oxford but THIS is quiet an extraordinary...
0	not the worse film or acting...: but definately not the best or even above average. why does kidman have to inhale rapidly like that after she finishes a sentence (referring her private video segments)? isn't she a trained actress that has learned breath control? i understand she wanted to protray a psycho-ditz, but... anyway, i watched it to the end, i guess mostly because it was based on a true story.
1	Fame is so important: It is not really my sort of movie, but it turned out to be a real winner. It is a story of a woman who wants to be famous at all costs. She ends out having her husband murdered and then... Overall it made me think.I thought it was well acted particularly by Kidman. The film was well filmed.Worth seeing.
0	A Train Wreck: This film really misses its mark. Billed as a black comedy, it fails to deliver any satirical bite whatsoever. Suzanne Stone's frequent video segments where she speaks directly to the camera and the flashforwards to some sort of Jerry Springer-like show are painful to watch. Yeah, Nicole Kidman is extremely sexy (duh), but it's not nearly enough to overcome her marginal acting, the clumsy dialog and the amateurish direction.See this movie for all the humor of "Dying Young" coupled with the social commentary of a SpongeBob episode.
0	0 Star Presentation of a 5 Star Movie; Sony/Image Lied: This is apropos of the DVD version. This movie is pan and scan, despite what the description says and what it says on the back of the box. It is1.33:1 format and even says at the beginning of the film: "This film has been modified from its original format-It has been formatted to fit this screen." If you got stung, demand a refund. What nitwit would release a film in an obsolete format?
0	What a pity: Thankfully I only paid [money] for this cd single. The original edit is the only decent version on the cd and that only goes for 4 minutes. Why do they pay dj's to remix these songs when the remixes are awful and the original in infinitely better. I think dj's have stopped trying and just put out any rubbish for cd fillers. My advice would be don't buy this until you have listened to it first.
1	Can we escape our past ?: This is the central question explored by Conrad in Lord Jim. Jim is ultimately a character who inspires our sympathy due to his inability to find reconcilliation for his one tragic moment of weakness. In him we find a person of tremendous potential that remains unrealized as the tragic circumstances of his abandoning his post aboard the Patna continually haunt him and the associated guilt drives him to isolation.Conrad successfully explores the concepts of bravery, cowardice,guilt and the alternative destinies that an individual may be driven to by these qualities.The narrative can be a bit confusing at times as Marlowe relates the tale by recalling his encounters with Jim. The book reminded very much of Somerset Maugham's THE RAZOR"S EDGE" in style. However I believe that Maugham did a much better job of incorporating the narrator into the flow of the story. Overall LORD JIM is a wonderful classic novel that I highly recommend.
0	A Little Hard to Follow for a Timeless Classic: Perhaps it is the nineteenth century writing style or the nautical terminology, but the pronoun-laced conversational passages have left me wondering who was on first, or who was the first mate.Conrad was a pathbreaker in the subjects he treated and no doubt had interesting experiences, but I prefer his other works.
0	Couldn't finish it: Ugh. This might have been a good book if it were half the size, but Conrad strains to keep the plot going amid the endless descriptions of sea, sky, and the characters' states of mind. Move along, move along! This ancient icon may be a monument to Conrad's mastery of his second language, and it may be a tragic psychological exploration of the universal heroic destiny (or something equally dense), but listening to it doesn't exactly keep you on the edge of your seat.
1	A great work of art: This book works on so many levels, it's mind boggling...it's an adventure story, it's a philosophical novel of ideas, it's got brilliant use of language. Like a painter, Conrad creates effects by deciding what to put in and what to leave out; he shifts narrators and fractures the time sequence to get maximum impact from his story. If you don't get it the first time, try again (I've read it many, many times). It's pure poetry and a genuinely profound book. The review below from VA that describes Conrad's theme (facing your fears) is totally right on the money -- so face your fears about reading a difficult book, buy a copy of Lord Jim and read it, and you'll be a better person for the experience.
1	exquisite: how many of us read NIGHT FLIGHT in high school as quickly as possible? my grown experience of Saint-Exupery is the opposite. i linger over every page. Saint-Exupery provides a literary meal to be savored page by page. call me an escapist but the skies over Buenos Aires never looked so good.
0	Long Winded, Sand and Stars: There's one good chapter, a good story, about survival. Otherwise, the pretentious Frenchman force feeds the reader his personal philosophy through a superfluous writing style. His name matches his style, long-winded and pretentious.
0	WHY???: I was definitely turned on by all of the hype before the movie. The commercial previews left me with much anticipation....LL, Jada, Vivica Fox, Whoopi!!! I couldn't wait! Then I saw the movie..........What happened? How could they have all of those folks in there and have that movie turn out that way? All I can really say is that I was truly disappointed and I don't know who was at fault. I've seen all of these people in other productions, so I know they can act....was it the director? the producer? Now here's a good question, Toni Braxton WAS in the movie, right? So why in the world would they have Jada up there acting like she was singing?????? I can't go on.............
0	Looks and feels too cheap to give as a gift: I bought this for my brother for his birthday but I had to return it because I was to embarrassed to give it to him. The dice have rounded edges so you can't use them for gambling. The cards are very cheap so you would also swap those out for your own. Basically you buy this just for the travel case and the chips. Well, the case I received was rusted. yes, a brand new case, out of the box, had rust on the handle and the closure buckles. I returned it.
0	Must be made in China: I purchased this for my step-daughter who is a poker novice. I thought she would like to have her own poker set to play and practice. One week after receiving it, she informed me that the set already began falling apart. The hinge came off and it's literally falling apart on her.This was embarrassing because it was a gift from me. Now I must redeem myself and purchase a better set. Do not buy this piece of junk.
0	Cute But Poor Quality: These are charming little espresso cups but they do not hold heat for more than 2 or 3 minutes. Granted, we live in a cold climate, so our house is usually cool, but one ought not have to drink a cup of espresso in 3 minutes before it cools off. Also the cup itself gets quite hot if one happens to touch it while using the handle. Best to give to your daughter for a toy.
1	This book is thorough but poorly written.: It is ironic that an account of the Steely Dan phenomenon is documented by someone whose writing skills are negligable. Becker and Fagen, two contemporary literary masters by most standards, would find it strangely fitting, I suppose. Sweet's saving grace is his penchant for detail. His tome has the stories for which every avid Dan fan hungers. Recording sessions, writing sessions, band reformulations, personal melodramas, etc. These elements make it enjoyable reading, especially when accompanied by revisitations to the legendary recordings. Listening to the CD's while making one's chronological journey through this book, is distictly thrilling, as well as eye(ear)-opening. The lack of an index and of footnotes limits this volume's usefulness as a reference source however. It would be nice to see a similar effort made by a writer who posesses a similar creative energy, quirkiness and skill to that of Becker and Fagen themselves.
0	Re-Releasing "An Evening With John Denver" under a different title!: If you already own "An Evening with John Denver" (five star album) then you don't need this one! The same program (exactly) has been repackaged with a new title and cover...less the two best songs! "Boy From The Country" and "Today"...the original is fabulous but why do it again?!?!?
1	Bang Bang Kiss Kiss: This album is great to listen to if you want to hear the begining of glassjaw. But this is just the tip of the ice berg. Demos go way back to Impossible Shot, Don Fury and Monster Zero. If you want to hear an even earlier inception of GlassJAw be sure to check out Sons of Abraham's album "Termites in His Smile" which is Jewish Hardcore. KKBB was ORIGINALLY released before EYEWTKAS so it has a different sound. But like every release glassjaw has put out, each one sounds different from the previous. Everyone into glassjaw should get this album, although the price listed on here is redic!! one should check out merchdirect.
0	No idea about this album: I ordered this album, but it never came. Beware of third party sellers, because they can be shifty. I certainly wish I could give you a review of this album, but unfortunately I NEVER GOT IT!!
1	prattgirl: I normally don't go for mushy romance type books...I am more of a fan of Patterson's other material, but this book was great. It was a quick read, which once I started, I couldn't put it down. Everytime I got my eyes dried and cheered up, bam- he hit me with something new and I was crying again. Patterson has outdone himself yet again.
1	Letters of the Past: I thoroughly enjoyed Sam's letters to Jennifer! I am an avid James Patterson Fan (especially of the Alex Cross Series) and to read something different like this from Mr. Patterson, I wasn't sure I was going to enjoy as much. However I have come to realize that to be a GREAT Author, you need to show some diversity. Well Mr. Patterson certainly shows that in this book. Its well written, a quick read and very emotional! I loved it!The book is about Sam (the grandmother), Jennifer (the grand-daughter) and Brendan (the lost love). Sam had left letters for Jennifer to read that showed that Sam's life wasn't at all as picture perfect as people may have believe it to be. It showed Sam's unhappiness with her husband and her new found love in another man. Upon coping with her own life in the big city, and now coping with Sam and then Brendan, we see how strong Jennifer is and how much her love for her grandmother, will get her through.
1	Great Story, Patterson Does It Again: Sam's Letters to Jennifer is one of those stories where you laugh, you cry, you make a fool of yourself. Jennifer is probably one of Patterson's most likable characters. Even though, there were times when the book kind of reminded me of Suzanne's Diary for Nicholas (very few), I was pleasantly suprised. It has a very happy and at the same time very heartbreaking ending. Their is a great mystery and it keeps you guessing until the very end. All in all it is very vintage Patterson. Fast paced and great story.
0	YUCK!: Has James Patterson sunk so low that he's now penning drivel just for the money? Every1-star reviewer of this book is right on, so I won't repeat their critiques. Every 4- and 5-star reviewer must have read a different book! I am angry that Mr. Patterson holds his loyal fans in such low esteem that he'd allow so shallow and boring a book to come to market. I am angry that his publisher was so greedy to do it! Like so many other bestselling authors, Patterson seems to have lost his touch, even in his mystery series. A smart author should know when to say when, and if he doesn't, then I do - WHEN! If he continues to write this kind of garbage, I will no longer read it.
0	Pathetic Dialogue: I don't understand why people adore Patterson. His lame dialogue is beyond tedious. This one could have been written by a teenager.
0	This is Og Mandino at his worst: This is a fast read, which continues to remind us that we should appreciate each day and those around us. Yes we should but I don't understand why Mr. Patterson wants to venture out of the genre that he excels in...mystery novels.
0	absolute treacle: It's amazing that a book this bad could have been published. It consists of one maudlin cliche after another. The widowed Jennifer, who miscarried her dead husband's child, has to deal with her beloved grandmother having a stroke. She meets someone who could be "the one" for her, but -- oops! -- he has a brain tumor and is likely to die. The writing is amateurish, full of telling instead of showing. The only reason I finished it was because I was trapped on vacation in a cabin with nothing else to read.
0	Majorly sucked: This book was jam-packed with cliches and wooden characters and dialogue. At 236 very small pages with a bigger font than necessary, this novel was probably more like150 real pages long. It also seemed to be written for, oh, I don't know - a ten year old maybe. The writing seemed to be geared to a fourth grade level. All I can hope for now is that it doesn't get made into a load-of-crap TV movie.
0	Just like Suzanne's Diary...: I really liked Suzanne's Diary for Nicholas, so I thought I'd check this out. I didn't think it was worth my time. The books seemed exactly alike - especially the tone of the character's writing style (Suzanne vs. Sam). It seemed clear that since Suzanne's Diary did so well, the author decided to write a book exactly like it. It was an incredibly predictable love story.
0	Tear Up the Formula: I am a fan of Mr Patterson's books, but this one was very disapointing. It was like he sat down and wrote up a list of "what will make women cry" and then put every single thing in the book. It is overdone to the point of you can not connect to the characters because the tragedy's that happen to them are too much and in a manner that is not realistic to everyday life. Mr Patterson needed to think instead of what will make a woman cry but what will make a good story not a formulated story. This book tried to force the reader to be emotional and instead makes you feel annoyed at the characters and the story.
0	Some of the worst writing I have ever read!: This author needs to stick to his normal genre. This was a good idea for a story line, but I felt like a14 year old wrote it! I have read most of his other books and have enjoyed them, but I had to force myself to finish this one.
0	NOT the originals: While the sound quality on these disks is excellent, be aware that app. 50% of the tunes are not the originals. Shout Factory should be ashamed, duping customers like this. Rhino Records would never pull such a stunt. Go for the 4-disk Rhino box set (Vol. One) instead. You can find many high quality used versions for sale all over the web, too.
1	The Only Doo-Wop collection you'll ever need: This is a fantastic overall collection of Doo-Wop groups/songs i have heard.This covers most of the variations of songs let alone the big hits of the day many years back
0	disappointing: I was hoping the songs were the original recordings by the original artists. Little Darlin is not the hit recording by the Diamonds. I don't know which group is singing but it's the wrong one. Disappointing.
0	Complete waste of time: I think this is the worst remake of any movie of all time. What a piece of garbage. Can't come close to original.
1	show the entire movie: Currently, the movie start with Barbara and her brother enroute to the graveyard. However years ago, the movie started with the introduction of the first, the one zombie walking through the graveyard. He was introduced as the murderer of a little girl and it showed his trial, execution and then him rising from his coffin killing the burial detail before he heads in Barbara's direction. I don't know why they edited this part out. It gave the movie a little more substance., ,
0	really BAD Sony transfer.: Saw a friend's copy of this and the difference between the DVD and this bluray is like night and day - pun intended - someone over at Sony when transferring this disc made the entire movie so utterly dark - it renders the disc nearly unwatchable. Granted the film is supposed to take place at night, the new transfer is quite frankly awful.
0	Lol...Filth: My absolute FAVORITE horror movie of ALL time is "Night of the Living Dead"...The1968, black/white, low budget version. I started watching the1990 version 'Sci-Fi' one afternoon, and I didn't stop watching it until it was over...Why? It was hilarious...Plus they had a better zombie movie on afterwards, and I didn't have anything else to do until then... This movie is despicable compared to the original. From terrible dialogue to terrible themes, this movie is just TERRIBLE... If you haven't seen the1968 version, with all enthusiasm from myself, please watch it a.s.a.p., but never subject yourself to the remake unless you're either punishing yourself, or you need a good laugh...
0	Garbage: Never buy this; it worked about1 week. I will never buy that again. I can't find another similar pump yet.
0	Not for everyone: If your main objective, is the study of human relationships,social rapports between humans, and conquering and seducing otherpeople, this movie is for you.Not an embarrassing movie, at all, for any of the actors. Just,a nutty story, and enfatuation of the author of the script withpeople, relationships, seduction, etc.This is not to say that the above aspects are unimportant. Not true.Just that, perhaps a movie about such a theme might be more funfor some people than others.
1	Sweet and funny, though completely predictable: This movie is not going to shock you with it's ending or offer you a new twist on the same old romcoms of the past. It is a quintessential romcom, but it's so very worth your time. It's very funny; I like all the actors in it, and it's just a fun, light-hearted movie.
1	Adorable Fun Movie, Great Cast!: Love this film. It's a classic. Ashley Judd & Hugh Jackman are fantastic! Greg Kinnear is also great in this film., love it, love it!
1	Sweet Little Movie: I know that this movie got "mixed reviews," whatever that means, but I found it charming and sweet and rather touching at some parts. I enjoyed the DVD for all the extras, too. I loved listening to Hugh Jackman with a different accent than his native Australian, and the oh so proper English accent he used in that other romantic movie he was recently in."Someone. . ." touches on so many emotions, and Ashley Judd is funny and manic, and her comic timing is great. I am very happy that I bought this movie. Don't miss the cheerleader scene. Hugh Jackman was gorgeous.
1	Hugh Jackman is scrumptous!!! ;): I actually bought this movie having never seen it. I saw Greg Kinnear on the box and read the blurb on the back and decided it was cheaper to buy it than to rent it. I absolutely fell in love with Hugh Jackman. Ashley Judd is always adorable in romantic comedies. Greg Kinnear is never bad in his roles,(but he sometimes picks horrid roles). The premise is cute and as romantic comedies go it wasn't horrible but it was rather predictable. What made me give it 4 stars is the fact that Hugh Jackman was absolutely delightful as the bad boy casanova. What took Hollywood so long to find him?
0	Not the best....: The print is great but can not find more than half of the answers for my puzzles... Tried over and over and the book is one big failure...
1	For light comic romantic entertainment, it's a winner...: Michael J. Fox, David Ogden Stiers, Woody Harrelson and all the supporting cast members are wonderful in this small, quiet story of a stranded doctor in a seemingly stagnant southern town. It's not a masterpiece, not an award winner, not an enduring example of its genre, but it is fun, and it is sweet, and it offers a nice escape from the troubles of the day. For decent folks, it's a very decent 90-minutes of movie magic.
0	Scanned from VHS?: This DVD has a very poor transcription of the original. It's either been poorly scanned from a very dirty print of the16mm film version, or scanned from the VHS. I suspect the latter as the colors are washed out, and the film shows the 'Do not pirate this video tape' warning after the film. I might even be tempted to think this has not been produced by the studio as the DVD menu looks like it was made in iDVD on a Mac.The only plus side is that the film is the full content, including the scenes that are omitted from the TV broadcast version.
0	duped: I thought I was purchasing the special edition of Pinocchio--at least, that was the picture of the dvd that was on the website. What I got was a Korean version. I got my money back.
1	Pinocchio (Disney Gold Classic Collection): Via Amazon - Excellent service, prompt delivery, excellent conditionas described, packaged well.Would use again.
0	no extra features!: I would review the movie just the DVD! First of all there are no making of, storyboard,production notes or any extra features ! The only extra feature you get with this DVD is the trailer! Oh, did I mention that the DVD has beautiful picture on it! Rent it first ,then buy at Disney outragous price that they want for this DVD! Just watch later on Disney will reissue it (and the others in their collection with all the extras this DVD lack! If you want those extra features stick with the studios Disney owns! They are Miramax,Dimension,Hollywood Pictures,Touchstones Pictures,ABC network,Anchor Bay and Walt Disney Pictures! I hope this info helps others looking for disney movies other than the animated movies!
0	Very Dissapointed: I purchased this movie for my son(6yrs) and the add stated that the DVD was in excellant shape. We played it once and noticed some sound problems but when went to play this again the sound was horrible. I sent an email to Amazon and received no response. I would like to get a replacement but I do not know how to go about this as I no longer have any information on the person who actually sent it to me.For the most part I have had good luck buying from Amazon but this was a terrible purchase and we are very dissapointed.
0	Pinocchio not the only one who lies!: This version of Pinocchio was in Italian! No where in the discription does this item indicate that it is the Italian version! Now I have to send it back to Italy for a refund...
1	It's a classic !!: How can you not love the classic version of Disney's Pinocchio. The platinum edition has a bunch of extras and enhanced quality. It felt like I was 8years old again, and watching it in the movie theater. A must buy for any Disney animation fan.
0	This movie was such a bad movie!: I've always hated this movie, not due to it's "violent and disturbing content" but because of it's bad acting and pure stupidity. This movie is a children's movie, anyone who complains that it's too scary and violent for kids is out of thier minds and are being way too uptight ( people like this are the reason why anime is so butchered when it comes to the States!). But that's not what I'm here to talk about, I'm here to talk about how bad this movie is. It's voice actors aren't that good, the wooden boy has equally wooden acting, and the ending of the movie made no sense whatsoever! Come on Disney! Explain to me why Pinoccio suddenly drowns at the end of the movie when earlier on the was walking at the botton of the ocean talking to the fish without any indication that he needs air to live in the first place?! It was just plain stupid, a move to make the viewers feel bad for the little hero, when his death makes no sense!
1	Pinocchio 2 Disc Anniversary Edition: This movie is a classic and one that I enjoyed as a child growing up. The xtras on this set make it even more endearing for young and old alike.
1	love it: Bought this for my mother. Fast shipping, the DVD was not in the original shrink wrap but the DVD was sealed. No problems with the DVD itself it played well.
1	BD-live features mostly worthless: I explored the BD-live feature for the first time last night, and most of the functions require registration on Disney's site. On Disney's site an FAQ asserts that those features are being discontinued, and account creation is no longer possible. WTH? This disc was only released 8 months ago, and the much-heralded BD-Live features that personalize your disc and experience are already outdated.For what it's worth, I just bought UP (released last week), and the BD-Live features from Disney appear to be nothing but downloading trailers for other films ... four of them. My verdict on Disney BD-Live => total waste of time.
0	Not very good: I actually ordered two dirtbags and within a week, they were both leaking dirt. So I went and ordered beed hacky sacks and now I'm happy. Did not like the dirtbags at all.
1	The Fundamentals of Math AND Philosophy: For anyone looking for an introduction to math, geometry more specifically, or philosophy at large, this is THE book, and in my estimation, THE edition to get. Heath is no fly-by-night pop-philosopher. His notes are almost as worthwhile as the text itself... a truly monumental feat.The rigors of geometry, the method of logic learned in these proofs, are one of the best ways to prepare the mind for real philosophy. Anyone can talk about the true and the good in a manner that inspires awe through vagueness and transcendent language, but that is a very different matter than the sort of philosophy that is built upon the real work of logic and hard-earned definitions.If you have any interest in the latter, I heartily commend this book to you.
1	Love it!!: I Love this Toque! I work in a milk refrigerator and wear it in there all the time. Supper thick and comfy.
1	Vote For Stillson!...: What a movie! What a cast! David Cronenberg took King's classic tale of precognition and predestination and gave it his own personal bleak touch! Christopher Walken (Sleepy Hollow) is the perfect Johnny Smith, taken out of normality and plunged into a psychic nightmare world. His gift / curse enables him to see both past and future events, leading him ever closer to his final destiny. Martin Sheen (The Little Girl Who Lives Down The Lane) is excellent as the lizard-like senate candidate, Greg Stillson. Horror mistress, Brooke Adams (Invasion Of The Body Snatchers, Shock Waves, Sometimes They Come Back) is Johnny's could / should-have-been "wife", unable to shake Johnny from her mind. Tom Skerritt (Alien) is the sheriff of Castlerock who seeks out Johnny in order to catch the infamous Castlerock killer. Herbert Lom (Asylum) is Johnny's doctor. Even Anthony Zerbe (The Omega Man) and Colleen Dewhurst (When A Stranger Calls) are along for this wild ride! Highly recommended...
1	Good movie: Not much to say. Good story, Christopher Walken is awesome, great ending, not too much gore.Four more words are required...
1	Very pertinent to how we raise our sons in this society.: Very pertinent to how we raise our sons in our society. A must read by ever parent while their son is growing up. If you like this book, try Go West Old Man by Max Barnet, a true tale about a father/son trip across the country in a pickup truck, discovering each other, including their needs. A clash of generations resolving.
0	Predictable: The book may be good for people whom have little understanding of children in general. Of course boys have emotions and ofcourse they are trained not to express those. It's up to the parents to ensure that boys learn to express their emotions. I wish the book had had practical examples of how to do it, instead of stories of angry, sad boys.
1	The classic analysis on the internal life of boys: I read most every book on this subject since I am a therapist and a parent.This is a great place to start.It might not be the most readable book but, nonetheless, is worth buying.
1	A Family Comedy That Is Out Of This World.: Suburban Commando is a1991 sci-fi action/comedy family film which stars WWE Legend Hollywood Hulk Hogan, Christopher Lloyd and Shelley Duvall. In this film Hogan portrays Shep Ramsey, a gruff and cynical intergalatic bounty hunter who, after a botched rescue mission, travels to Earth for rest and relaxation. There, Ramsey begrudgingly makes friends with a couple(Lloyd and Duvall)and their two kids. While on Earth, Shep comically learning the Earth cultures and customs. Suburban Commando also has an appearance by WWE wresling star The Undertaker, as one of Ramsey's arch-villains. The special feature includes a trailer of the movie and trailers for New Line's other family films. This film is perfect for kids, parents and wrestling fans of all ages.
1	Great Flick!: Loved it in the 80's, story and humor sill holds up! Kevin Bacon young and energetic. Great fun!Spawned sequels which don't hold a candle to this original.
1	funny and a little scary: We watched this again after many years. It is still just as funny! Kevin Bacon is great. I love Reba in it too.
1	Good Entetainment: Just a fun movie. Never made it big in the movies but an enjoyaable experience overall. Some swearing but it fits -- not just for the sake of using the F word which, incidentally, is never used.
1	Awesome Picture!!!: Now this is what High Definition is all about.I was very Pleased with the "Picture Quality" on the "Tremors" HD DVD.The image makes you think you are watching a 2007 movie release.The picture is awesome.
1	Don't walk across the football pitch in the dark...: This movie is in my personal top10 - which just shows how much I enjoyed it. It may not be art, but by gum, it's cracking good fun. The comedy is suitably black and nasty, the tension is very palpable, and the concept - well, the concept may not be absolutely original (what is, these days?) but it is very good. I think very highly of it as an example of how good a horror movie should be, ironic, intelligent, sassy, smart and well-acted. The monsters are JUST this side of credible, which makes it all the more riveting. Last night, I was walking across three deserted football pitches on campus and suddenly remembered this movie - and had to keep reminding myself that it was JUST a movie. That is the sign of a successful "beast" horror movie. It relies upon common sense, a humourous screenplay, actors who do not ham any more than is necessary, and a general atmosphere of cracking good fun. Brilliant stuff.
0	Quite possible the worst movie of all times.0 stars: This movie [stinks]. The story is nothing like the original, the acting is horrific, the swordfighting utterly ridiculous.The scene that sums it all up is when the guards won't chase after a carriage going about1 mph and everyone escapes.I have no idea how on earth anyone could make a movie so terrible. Extremely torturous to watch. Do not buy it, do not rent it. In fact, just read the book, which is awesome.
0	Laurel & Hardy Perils: The Further Perils of Laurel and HardyI received this item this week(March 7 2008) & it was one I did not know was avalable & saw thru a link. I have the other items in this Youngson series from other publishers late last year. This one is poor to, say the least, with faded & washed-out images although the sound is OK. The grain is very high and contrary to another review, PAL TV in Australia in the1950s & 60s did not look anything as bad as the images in this DVD. The other Youngsons that came out last year were better although the highest priced one did leave a lot to be desired in picture quality also but not like the Further Perils. If only Warner bros would buy more of these things for extras on their great DVD releases then we would have restoration similar to what they have provided on at least one L&H; DVD set. But to have this title in the collection gets us to more completion of the Youngson compilations on DVD.
0	Received a used set: Nothing fundamentally wrong with it, but the manufacturer's original box had been opened before and rather clumsily taped back together, and the "aluminum" case is covered in small scratches and dents. I don't have the time to return the set for replacement since it was bought as a gift for an upcoming occasion. Disappointing.
0	A disappointment!: Having made the change to Veganism recently, and discovering Seitan, I was expecting this cookbook to open the door to non-meat Paradise! The description of the book, and the reviews of others made it sound like the Holy Grail.Bah.I'd say 40-50% of the recipes using the prepared Seitan call for the "wheat-meat" to be battered and deep fried. So WHERE is the healthy cooking in THAT? I was looking for recipes for the actual Seitan preparation, using different seasonings and flavors, and then hoping to find a fake meatloaf recipe, or a fake turkey and stuffing for Thanksgiving.I'm still looking.
1	Seitan Quickly: Cookbook on Cooking with Seitan was in excellent condition and arrived very promptly. The book itself wasn't all I had hoped--too many weird ingredients that I can't begin to find--but that is NOT the fault of Amazon or the bookseller who sent the order.
0	Damaged goods: While my sister was extremely excited about the glasses I got her has a gift, one arrived broken. When I called customer service to replace the broken glass I was notified that Amazon would not replace the damaged item. I could get a full refund, but they would not send a replacement. I was appalled. What business refuses to replace damaged items? You can guarantee I won't be buying anything being shipped through Amazon anymore. I will buy directly from the seller.
0	Screens wore out quickly: The screens on this product wore out very quickly and are $20 to replace which is almost the cost of the entire product at $35. Everything else seems fine.
0	Very disappointed: This is a set book for the University course I'm following. To be honest, I've not read it all. I've read the introductory chapter and picked at the rest of the book.I'm disappointed that other reviewers suggest that this book is well written and academic. It's a rambling incoherent mess of ideas that proposes large-scale state censorship/'perception control' and as such has no place in universities which should protect the ideals of academic freedom and free speech. The net is not considered as a political forum, rather there is a heavy authoritarianism.I'm very disappointed with it.
0	Not her best: I love Virginia Henley but these characters are so disconnected and unromantic. There is simply nothing endearing about any of the players in this book, in fact most of all the characters are so flawed and dark I hate to consider it a romance. Definately put this on your "if there is nothing else to read" list.
0	insipid: this book and others like it so insult the intelligence of anyone with half a brain. Read something substantial for a change!
1	A CD you can listen to over and over...: I'd never heard of James Tipper until I heard about this CD on a newsgroup. I rarely buy CD's based on one song but I did this time and was very suprised. It has lots of different styles and moods so you don't get tired of one vibe like you do with alot of CD's. There's something for everyone. I like the techno sounding stuff like Bioluminescence and Evolve and the title track and my wife likes the ballads that are done mostly with piano. Lyrics are great and there are clever production touches. Overall, money well spent.
0	Neighbor's Dog Liked it More than I thought...: I got this product to keep my neighbor's pesky dog out of my goddamned garden!I coated some of my seeds with this stuff before I planted a recent carrot patch. As expected, the dog came and ate all of the carrots. I expected him to get sick or at least no longer enjoy the carrots due to their Uranium nature, but he loved it! He continued to eat the carrots, visibly growing as he ate them. He left my garden at least 6 inches taller and with a spryness I have never seen out of the damn old mutt. I watched this scene from my window with horror and I still am not sure what to do about this. At night I can see a faint green glow coming from the neighbor's doghouse which I assume is a result of my carrot shenanigans.I only gave this product 2 starts because it grew, overnight, the largest carrots I have ever seen. They were 2' long and a vibrant orange that I have never seen before.
0	Do not buy...: Bought this for a weather experiment. Could only produce1.19 gigawatts, had to seek out another source that was very unpleasant to work with.
1	Excellent Fuel for Robot Army: As a busy mad scientist with many voices distracting me on a nearly constant basis, it is helpful to find such a wonderful product that I can use on on a daily basis. Whether as fuel for my robot army (coming soon to a neighborhood near you) or as a catalyst for mutation or just as a healthy snack, this product continues to amaze. My wife/captive swears by it and uses a pinch in her morning coffee. She is literally glowing from the inside out because this product. Highly recommended!
0	Need a lawyer or an act of Congress !!!!: After the 200 jars of your uranium ore arrived at my home. A heavily armed S.W.A.T team tossed in a few tear gas canisters and broke down my front door. Thankfully, they have WIFI here at Guantanamo. I hear my wife will be getting out of the hospital soon and my kitty kat will be fetching tear gas canisters in heaven now. All of my new friends don't speak a word of english but the weather is nice here. Thanks Amazon.com and thank you Department of Homeland Security!
1	Thank you Jewish Physics: My son is only 6'2 and if he wishes to be an NFL QB, well then, mutation is the best possible avenue now that human growth hormone is banned. I put this stuff on his cereal in the AM and now after a month he stands at 8'1. Can you say signing bonus?
0	Can of cancer: I got some of this stuff to cover myself with during Halloween. I thought it would be cool to walk around glow in the dark.Instead the day before Christmas I got diagnosed for cancer of everything and I've got [...] less for chemotherapy treatments (great, more radiation) since I can't return this can of death.On a happy note, my wife just found out she was pregnant. I hope our kid doesn't have two heads and ten arms. Well, if the baby does maybe we can send it to India where it will be worshiped as a god.
0	NOT ENOUGH!: It did little more than power a death star, so I returned it to the Earth forces... DO NOT BUY!
0	WARNING: DO NOT EAT: Oratory ingestion is not recommended. I decided to eat some of my Uranium last week and experienced some unwanted side-effects. I now go by the name General Zorg AND YOU SHALL BOW DOWN TO ME AND MY MUTANT POWERS!!!
1	Do Not own yet, but will in near future...: I am waiting for my full body hazmat protection suit to come in the mail. Afterwards I will order this unit. Great price!
1	I like it. I love it! I want some more of it!!: Yeah, give it to me, baby. Give me some more! What a tasty little movie!Now, let me be serious. This movie is delicious! Gibson and Hunt are both terrific. Have you seen Braveheart? Well, that movie is only good because of Mel Gibson. What Women Want is good and funny for the same reason. Maybe Helen Hunt had a little to do with that, but Gibson alone is sufficient for a movie's goodness and funniness. Basically, Gibson and hunt made this movie work; the screenwriter and director and everyone other than Gibson and Hunt had nothing to do with it.
0	Distaff.: Rather pretentious comedy featuring Mel Gibson, who, despite all the emasculation, is in bumpy, toothy, silly-little-boy mode. What women want, indeed! He's a Don Juan in the advertising world, who gets zapped by his blow-dryer while drinking some interesting-looking Cabernet. The result? He's given the ability to read women's thoughts. This is distressing, at first. Regressive, too: according to the writers (all women), these Turn-Of-The-Millennium-I'm-Every-Woman women primarily want to feast their eyes on Mel's tooshy. Hear me ROAR! Well, our hero soon learns to use his newfound Superpowers for his own profit, but then . . . ah, but then, the movie suddenly gets very serious. Most of the second act is dull. The movie finally wears out its welcome starting with about the last15 minutes. Rent only if you want to annoy your boyfriend . . . which is REALLY What Women Want! (Kidding, kidding -- sheesh)
0	*GAG* - Not another sugar-coated chick flick!!: This movie proves that Hell is full and the dead are walking the Earth, making these movies and sitting in theatres watching them. The old "all men are scum until they get in touch with their feelings" plot is dredged up again in this lamebrain film. I guess I was supposed to get all doe-eyed and say "Is'nt Mel dreamy?" and laugh at the supposed "Comedy" while watching this flick, but it made me wretch! Boring, silly and a waste of time.What do men want? Our money back!
0	predictable: predictable hollywood flick. not horrible if you've just eaten too much, it's1 in the morning, and you need something to zone out with. aside from that scenario, not worth the time.

1	EXCELLENT: This Cd of Daft Punk is unbelievable. If you wanna hear rythmic sounds without profanity, threats or abuse of women, excellent tunes, great dance or work out music.
1	good overall toy: this is a very fun boat overall. it isn't very fast, but it has great range and it's batteries last a long time. the only problem with the battery system is that it takes 6 AA batteries and u keep having to get new ones. I also recommend bringing it to a place with no waves so the boat doesn't tip. Overall, this is a very good boat for its price and especially good for younger children.
0	There are none so blind then those who refuse to see!: Yes Mrs Pulling has done her best to caution others about "breaking with reality", and her book serves as an adequate example of what can happen when someone does become reality impared; it contains no real facts to support her claims that Dungeons and Drangons had any thing to do with any deaths what so ever, and what "facts" she does offer are either falsely described or out right lies. I agree that if you are a bad parent you should probably error on the side of caution and limit the activities of your little monster, but I think "not keeping guns in the house" and "not letting your child butcher pets" (both things Mrs Pulling admits she or her son did) should come well before stopping them from playing D&D. Besides if you get rid of D&D who will you blame when they finally do kill someone?
1	Wow!: We had heard about this item (and the many similar items) and decideded that we'd give it a try. Wow! We had no idea how fantastic it would be...or would continue to be...and continue to be...The design is great. The controls work. It's a fantastic piece of equipment. The only complaint is that it's not silent, but we don't think that would matter under the circumstances - we weren't either.
1	Elvis review: If you bought this you proably already like Elvis music. This cd is worth the money. Many of my favorite Elvis songs were in his movies and never released as singles or for that matter hits. This is a great way for me to hear them again.
1	Excellent edition of the book: This is an excellent edition of the book, it even includes a small timeline biography of Alexandre Dumas which was very insightful. Overall no complaints with this product at all.
1	The Count of Monte Cristo by Alexandre Dumas (kindle): All I can say is AMAZING. This novel is incredible. The subtle and deliciously wicked scenarios that Edmund Dantes orchestrates to exact his revenge on his enemies are awe-inspiring and SOOOO entertaining. Although the 2002 Jim Caviezel movie is a great stand-alone film, it reveals so little of the subplots and supporting characters that you can dive into the book as if it's a brand new story and it really doesn't ruin either one. Please keep in mind that it IS a19th century novel, so you'll have to wade through some serious romantic protestations, but they do not take away from the action. Definately worth reading...and FREE on Kindle. Thank you Kindle!
1	This is the Muhammad Ali of books, The Greatest of all time.: Dumas is the greatest story teller ever, and this is his finest work. If you love adventure, great yarns or being captivated by excellence, read this book.
1	Worth a second read.: I read and enjoyed this book as a youth. Later I read some of the Three Musketeers, was bored, and thought maybe Dumas had been a taste of adolescence. But the second time around, I found this story still a great read. Monte Cristo is not a study in psychology or culture: it is an amusement park ride before Disney, an Indiana Jones film in ink: a heck of a way to spend a rainy afternoon. (And make sure your plans for the evening are flexible.)The version I bought, Bantom, was too skinny, however. (Thus the missing star, also for typos.) Life is too short to read half of a masterpiece. Subvert the culture of instant gratification, and buy the unabridged version. Same goes for Hugo's Les Miserables, a similar bit of19th Century French romanticism, even more rambling and magnificent in its un-cut version.
1	Kinda wish I had read the longer one!: This is BY FAR, the best book I have EVER read! I HATE reading, and I read this 450 page book in three days! It was for summer reading for school, and I thought that I would read it before i saw the movie coming out soon! I AM SO GLAD I DID!! Thanks!
0	Poor Quality: Let me be clear that I am a big fan of The Count of Monte Cristo, but don't spend your money on this copy. Visually, it's unappealing to the eyes (looks like a phone book). What is far worse, though, is that the editing in this book is horrendous. I will be half way through a sentence and the other half of it is starting a completely knew paragraph. There are spelling errors throughout the text. And what is really annoying is that the table of contents' page numbers don't match up with the text's page numbers. There's about a 50 page difference between the two. How that happened, I don't know. But, let me tell you that there are better unabridged copies of this excellent book out there.
1	The Count of Monte Cristo: I first read this wonderful novel in high school. Interestingly, I read this book by personal selection and not by a Literature assignment. I remember it as the first book I loved. I am a voracious reader of reviews on Amazon and other sources. A recent review of this book reminded me that I should read it again. I'm enjoying it as much now as I did then.
1	The Count of Monte Cristo: Although Count of Monte Cristo kept me on my toes wondering what would happen next, it seemed to drone on by without a certain explanation. I loved the book, it just had parts that i thought Dumas could have easily done without. Besides that, Count of Monte Cristo was a wonderfully written book that deserves full credit on itself. It had such passion and devotion inside it; it's as though Dumas himself was feeling the same imprisonment as Dantes.
1	The Count of Monte Cristo (Oxford world Classics): Thoroughly entertaining and timeless read. Makes one reflect strongly on the emotions and ups and down of life. I wish I had realized the cross references were present at the end of the book as it may have clarified a few things. All in all I found it to be a book that I did not want to put down. I read reviews that recommended the unabridged versions and I am glad that I read it.
1	Superb, but definitely a product of its time: Judging by the reviews here, criticizing this book is like criticizing Shakespeare -- anything less than full throated praise is dismissed. Let me be clear: I loved this book and it was well worth the time it took to read. It is deservedly considered a timeless classic.Nevertheless, it definitely has a pace that is not seen in modern books. If this had been created by a contemporary writer it would probably be about 25% shorter. I'm not saying that would make it better, it would simply make it a book created for modern sensibilities.If you like fast-paced modern writing, you will definitely need to recalibrate your expectations. Once you accept this book on its own terms, it is a very rewarding read.
0	Terrible, terrible edition: A wonderful classic story butchered by a senseless editor who removed major portions of the story without letting the reader know. The description on the back cover misleads the consumer into thinking that one is getting so much more than the full text (the edition includes a brief introduction of the author, critical analysis and explanatory notes). I'd rather do without the side commentary and get the full original manuscript. The problem isn't that the editor decided to abridge the book, but that they chose to conceal this fact from the reader.The removed portions are integral to the storyline and I was left baffled by how disjointed the novel seemed, so uncharacteristic of Alexandre Dumas. Then I found out it's not the author's fault.Book is highly recommended, but I would also recommend that readers invest in more trustworthy versions out there.
1	Excellent: Old world type thriller. Definitely better than the movie. Talk about revenge being best served cold. This is the epitomy of that.
0	Abridged version, buyer beware.: This is the abridged version of the Dumas classic.Having not read the original yet, I can only compare itto The Three Musketeers. Dumas' writing style losesenergy in the abridging process. The reader ought tobe aware that the story has been simplified and summarized.If you want the true flavor of Dumas, order the unabridgedversion.
0	Horrible: Don't waste your time reading this edition. There are many grammatical errors in this edition. Terrible formatting will not let you get pleasure from reading this book.
1	Great story of redemption: Sweet revenge at it's finest.Love, romance, long friendship gone wrong.It's all in here. Not like the movie, so don't beterribly disappointed.
0	Thumbs down: The first time I watched these years agoI liked them. Today they seem a little outdated??Just did not enjoy them really. Thumbs down.
1	breath of fresh air: For the Love of Children, is filled with wonderful stories and quotes that will let any parent at any phase of parenting know that they are not alone.It is delightful to hear other people give voice to my parenting challenges, such as Robert Frost's statement about a father and mother toward son and daughter. One of the best quotes, "If you don't want your children to hear what you're saying, . . . . pg 27
1	This book would make a great Mother's day gift!: This book was given to me. I read it and placed it on my book shelf. As a writer, I have used the quotes in articles and letters. A perfect addition to your library if you write to or about children.
1	Highly recommended baby doll!: This laughing calin doll is perfect for young toddlers. She is small and light enough to be carried around easily. Her expression is very pleasant. She is the perfect "play Mommy" doll. She appears very well made and durable.
1	This is one of the best movies from the late '80s: It's been close to twenty years since I watched this film. At first, it looks like an 80's attempt at a date movie, but this one goes much further than that. It has a captivating plot, likable characters, and one of the greatest soundtracks of all time. Even though I'm not a fan of musicals or dancing, I still found myself enjoying this story. If you are a fan of Saturday Night Fever, you will most likely appreciate Dirty Dancing as well.
1	IT WAS THE BEST!!!: IT WAS THE BEST MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN. IT WAS ROMANTIC AS WELL AS EXCITING. NOTHING COULD EVER TOP IT. PATRICK SWAYZE IS THE BEST ACTOR IN THE WORLD AND JENNIFER GREY WAS PRETTY GOOD TOO.
0	Ordered for Christmas but...: Ordered for delivery for Christmas but after order was told it would not be delivered by Christmas. It was confirmed at purchase time to be delivered before Christmas. Now I have to go back out and find it in a store and then try and return this one to Amazon. Not much fun...
1	One of the best movies ever made!!: This movie is the best one I have ever seen. I have the soundtrack and it's great too. The story, dancing and music is unbelievable!! I think everyone should see this at least once in their life!!
1	I LOVE THIS MOVIE!!!: I always thought this was a lame movie, but I really love it now that I've seen it. Yes, it IS a chick-flick, so if you don't like those types of movies, don't buy it.
1	I love this movie!: Jennifer Gray and Patrick Swayze are the terrific duo in this dancing romance on the road! I love the song Baby, when she is teaching him the cha-cha! I definatly recommend this movie to everybody. A time-less classic!
1	sexy/thoughtful: this album especialy the tittle cut remedy makes me think that he really knows how woman want to be treated. keep up the good work we really need "brothas" out there that still think like you.
1	8701-Usher!: This cd is HOT ... I love it. One of my favorite Usher cds ever! Has several hits... One of his best ever! Must have for the fan of Usher! I am happy to have it for my own collection! Its great from start to finish!
1	LOVE THIS ALBUM!!!: Usher's "8701" is one of the best R&B albums I have EVER purchased. EVERY SONG on this album is beautiful. I always like Usher but with this album.....I'ma die-hard fan! He does a great job balancing the up tempo songs and the ballads. The fast tracks make you wanna get up and dance and the slow ones make you wanna cry and just call that special someone in your life and just tell them "I love you". His voice is excellent on every track and most importantly.....the man lets you know what love is about. The jewels on this album are "U remind me", "U got it bad", "Twork it out", "Can u help me", "If I want to", "Good ol' Ghetto" and "TTP" (lol, basically every track on the album!). On a last note....those of you who know what good R&B music is, this album is a must, TRUST ME!!!
0	who would have thought..: that this cute little guy by the name of Usher who came out with the awesome "My Way" would grow up to be an arrogant womanizer with about as much originality as Britney Spears. Grow up Usher. Be a man. You either have the talent/personality/ and originality or you don't. Leave r & b and go be one of Brit's back up dancers.
1	2nd BEST CD I'VE EVER HEARD!!: Second to NSYNC'S, "Celebrity", this CD is my favorite of all time! When you want to listen to13 of15 songs on a CD, you know it's good! This CD has an amazing balance of ballads and fast trax and rap. And the ballads are INCREDIBLE! "U Got It Bad" is one of the best songs I've ever heard in my life. I would DEFINITELY recommend that anyone a fan of Pop, R&B or Rap to get this CD, YOU WILL LOVE IT!
1	usher was creative then: now THIS is the usher I liked who actually released good music instead of that stale let it burn and yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah. He was on fiyah in summer 2001 till 2002 with his blazing hot videos and being himself with a little bit of michael jackson influence instead of trying to be his minime like he does all the time today and not even be close to dancing as great.
0	Don't Bother: A horrible movie which makes Dull & ordinary (with the exception of sex) one of the most complex writers/individuals that Ireland has produced. If cinematography alone is your sole requisite in a film by all means buy the DVD. One good aspect of the movie; Ewan & Susan Lynch's rendition of 'The Lass of Aughrim'...but you can download that.
0	ewan mcgregor's hot: although ewan mcgregor is my ultimate favorite actor in the entire world..i have to say that this was a terrible movie. and yes..sadly, ewan co-produced it! <i don't why he would ever sign to be co-producer of THAT film..it should have been moulin rouge!> So back to the movie..I hated Susan Lynch in this film. has she ever heard of shaving? I know this is back in the day so I'll give her that much. But she was a little TOO hairy for me. This movie is really graphic and it shows a lot of uh..stuff. Ewan was so cute in it! But I think there could have been a better Nora picked. This is definitlely an erotic film like the actual overview says. the reason why i gave this film only1 star is because it was so hard to follow! i figured out in the middle that time was jumping VERY fast. they should have dates as subtitles. It jumped ahead quickly, it was too graphic, and overall..it's probably one of the worst films i have ever seen. sorry ewan!!!
1	Riveting Reading!: Fast paced, I could hardly put it down. It left me wanting more. I,will recommend this book to family and friends
0	good for a b-day prsent?: my brother loves these game. )hes favorite is the one for computer but we lost the disk when i was in kindergarten) when this comes out tell me how great it is!
0	TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE.: C'mon people! How fun is it to watch a racist, lewd, borrish, and dumb person beating up people for no f-----g reason. As little as possible. All the film does is show two unorthadox sleep in car all night, hold up bars just because there are black people there, and reapeatedly getting the same food as 24 minutes ago. And a point that should go out, THERE IS NO CAR CHASE! Just someone chasing a train! I will end by saying that this trashy film deserved no oscars! BYE!
1	Fast moving police drama: This is a story about a New York City police detective (Gene Hackman) and his partner (Roy Scheider) and their relentless pursuit to discover a drug source. The high speed chase scenes take them far outside the city limits and get deadly when an attempt is made to kill Gene Hackman's character ("Popeye" Doyle).This is good police drama and quite entertaining.
1	Timeless, Greyish and Well Structured Police Story: There is a scene at the beginning of this classic movie wherein everyone seems to be having a great time in a bar when from nowhere a sort of stop-time moment occurs when dectective Popeye eyeing some locals knows for dead-center certainty something major is wrong. From there it is only a matter of piecing together (like the ubiquous and sinsiter car) the plot. This gritty, seemingly greyish and astonishingly well-edited movie offers a powerful glimpse into the mechanisms and travails of international corruption
1	THE BEST CRIME MOVIE EVER MADE!: French Connection is a exciting action/crime film starring Gene Hackman as Popeye Dole, a N.Y. Narcotics Cop who is investigating the recent flow of herion coming into N.Y. He and his partner (Roy Shrieder) get into the absorbing process of phone tapping, following suspects, and stakeouts. A real good crime movie from director William Friedkin. One of the best films ever made, also has the most exciting chase scene in history. A winner!!
1	THE FRENCH CONNECTION: DEFINITELY KEEPS YOUR INTEREST. IT CONTAINS SO MANY DIFFERENT FACETS THAT ONE WANTS TO VIEW IT SEVERAL TIMES OVER, JUST SO THAT YOU HAVEN'T MISSED ANYTHING!
0	inadequate disclosure: Received the book in a timely fashion but the CD-ROM and the Timeline were NOT included. This should have been clearly stated in the listing! The Timeline was to be a 60th birthday present for my twin sister.
0	Low quality sound: The volume is low and even with my Tv turned all the way up I can barely hear it : (
1	THE REAL PLAYAS: TWO PLAYAS PLAYING HARD TO GET WITH EACH OTHER MORRIS CHESTNUT AND VIVICA A. FOX PLAY GAMES WITH EACH OTHER . THIS IS JUST A MOVIE ABOUT THE PERSON WHO HAS THE BEST GAME I ENJOYED IT AND I LIKED IT A LOT. IF YOU LIKE COMEDY AND IF YOU ARE A FAN OF ANY OF THE CHARACTERS IN THE MOVIE THEN YOU WOULD DEFINITELY LIKE THIS MOVIE.
1	GREAT resource!: I've been in a Disciple bible study class for 5 years and have seen others with this book; finally decided to order it for myself. It's a great resource and has good information that is factual and concise. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the Bible!
1	AWESOME!: Awesome guide! The best as finally been put out for a reference price guide on the best ever movie star MARILYN MONROE! Even she would be amazed I bet! Terrific job! Thanks for all the hard effort in making it! All worth it!
1	Crystal Growing Science Kit: This was a gift to my grandson and he was mesmerized and could not wait to start growing the crystals. I told him I did something like that when I was a child, grew rock formations in a fish bowl.
0	I never thought Meryl Streep could give a "bad" performance.: I never thought that Maryl Streep could give a bad performance. It is difficult to believe this is the same actress from Sopjie's Choice and The French Lt.'s Woman. Oh, well, I guess one stinker in an otherwise glorious career is to be forgiven. Don't watch unless you are a "movie masochist."
0	Okay !!!!: This movie was okay, it wasn't a10 more like a 3..... I could have gone without buying this foolishness
0	Too drawn out!: I usually enjoy reading this author however that was not the case in this particular title. The plot was too drawn out.
1	Hilarious: This movie was even funnier than the first. I love how they brought back characters from the first movie and continued storylines. Definitely recommended, but you need to make sure you see the first movie before this one. :)I'd stop after this one though, Tremors 3 was pretty bad.
0	Not quite...: Tremors 2 doesn't live up to what I had hoped for. The movie has its funny moments, but just doesn't hook the viewer like the original. A key ingredient missing in this movie is Kevin Bacon. If you haven't seen the first Tremors, I would strongly recommend NOT viewing the sequel. However, if you enjoyed the first one, the sequel may be worth your time.
0	Worthless!: They peeled off within a week. I cleaned the tub; wiped it down with alcohol and even put a heater in it for a couple hours to warm up the surface. I did everything I could to insure they would adhere well, but to no avail.
0	I really don't recommend this product.: Purchased this a while back, and was disappointed from the moment I opened the box. The construction was flimsy and the mic didn't even work. All this thing did was waste time and money.
0	drying and sticky: I didn't care for this product at all. I found that it dried out my hair and was also very sticky. I will not purchase again...
1	This book is possibly the best I've ever read.: This book is extraodinary. I started reading it expecting it to be boreing. After the first eight pages, I was reading it every free second I got. I can guarantee that anyone will love this book.
0	A story as lush as the planet it is set on!: Come on! This book is over rated. It is an amusing story but unengaging. The characters are cold and it is difficult to empathise with them. I did read the next two books to see how the story was resolved...but it wasn't, it turned into the X-files! i.e. continuous suspense, convolutions, but no resolution. A story must have a beginning, middle, and, and, um, an end? The recent appearance of the Dune 'brand extension' books "House Atreides" and " 'Harkonen" confirm that the story continues, be it chronologically before or after the original Dune. Should have been a trilogy at most.
0	A Great Book, Horrible Price: I had this book. I've read it twice. When I moved I left it so that the next person would be able to read it and enjoy it, knowing that I would probably get a digital version the next time I wanted to read it. $14.99 for a 40 year old book that can be picked up in innumerable used book stores? That much for a book that is 40 years old? There's no reason for it to be more expensive than a print version. Now, instead of buying it, I'm going to pass. I'm also going to pass on all the sequels I might have bought after it, and all because Penguin doesn't understand the digital world yet. Readers shouldn't have to pay for a publisher's mistake. Set a reasonable price for this book, and I'd happily purchase it!
0	predictable: After10 pages everybody could guess the end.I just hate predictable book the first part of this book is worth reading but if your not an hard core sci-fi fan drop it after.
0	It;s just not very good: I read the Dune novels as a teenager and recently started re-reading them15 years later.Dune Messiah is exactly as I remembered it: a disappointment not just in comparison to Dune, but a true mediocrity in its own right, with a surprising amount of fragements of thoughts and ruminations that just don't make any sense. The point of Dune Messiah, and Children of Dune, is to enjoy the much grand God-Emperor of Dune.
1	You won't regret: Simply the best novek I have read. This not just a sci-fi novel. The world created by Herbert can only suit a envoirement in future. The story starts somehow complicated but soon you will discover the intelligence of the author. If you haven't read it yet, this must be first thing you have to read.
1	Brief, but to the point: This book is very brief, but I guess this is how its supposed to be since it seems Frank Herbert wanted it to be a link between Dune before Paul, and the Dune after Paul. The end of the book is the perfect way to take us to the next stage, the children of Muadib.
1	The Greatest Novel Ever Written: Words cannot describe the depth of this book's greatness. Not only is Dune the greatest single sci-fi novel ever written, it is the greatest novel ever written. It introduces the reader to a new and fantastic world, more realistic than any other in literature. Frank Herbert was a genius. Paul is a little stiff, but at the same time, he is more "real" than most people I know. This is the first novel that I've read that wore me out reading it, that is how powerful it is. There are scenes that simply left me physically exhausted after reading them. No book I have ever read before or since has drawn me in like Dune does. Enough good things cannot be said about Dune. It is pitiful that the Modern Library skipped this in it's listing. Dune blows Ulysses, Gatsby and anything by Faulkner completely out of the water. Whether you're a sci-fi fan or not, you MUST read Dune. You will NOT regret it.
1	The best book I ever read: Dune is the best book I ever read. I know it is not a good argument to persuade you, but it is the only thing I can say. Read it.
0	Great writing - poor publishing: ACE reprint of 'Dune' - ISBN0-441-17271-7never before have i seen a book contain so many print & editorial errors...ink application is not homogeneous, resulting in many blots & light print areas...print pressure is inconstant, resulting in wavy print & apparent font reduction...then there are the editorial errorspg.108 "the gift is the blessing of the river" <giver>...the most egregious so farif there had been physical defect allowing return to place of purchase, this paperback would surely have been exchanged for a previously published edition of better quality
0	Do yourself a favor and don't open it!: I rather liked "Dune" but this poor excuse for a sequel is just plain awful! When i closed the book I couldn't even remember what it was all about. So unless you are a great fan of Frank Herbert or intend to read the entire series, don't bother.
0	Sorry, but I really didn't like it very much: I guess it's just personal taste, but I'm sorry to say that I did not really like Dune that much. I really wanted to; I know it has a great reputation, and legions of fans who have read it multiple times. I just finished reading it last night. The overall setting and the complex story were fine. The opening scene, the visit from the Reverend Mother, was intriguing. But, somehow the writing style for the rest of the book just didn't click with me. You know how some books have wonderfully-crafted language and sentence structure that mezmerizes you? Well, this book was not like that. Time and again I found some passages awkwardly worded. As well, while there was a great assortment of characters, I felt no emotional attachment to any of them.I had previously read a couple of Herbert's sci-fi novels, and liked them, but this one, well, doesn't get 5 stars from me. Your mileage may vary...I won't be reading any of the remaining books.
1	Read the Series: I only read Dune after I had seen the movie (2 hour version) and was overwhelmed! I then proceded to read the rest of the series (6 books) and tape all three (the two, three and four-hour) versions of the movie. The book Dune is one you must read thru at least twice, including the glossary and index before all the ramifications of the 'history' start to become clear (The Butlerian Jihad, for example) and the realizations will change your first impressions, and so you will READ IT AGAIN!! I would love to read a 'prequal' of this series, but alas, for naught. For a great time on a rainy Saturday, get all six, sit down, and read them in order. You will not be disapointed.
1	DUNE ...Best Science Fiction Book I have ever read!: Of course that is just what every other review thinks but hell it's the truth! I picked this book up from my girlfriends brother for a school report... (yeah i don't read muchy for my enjoyment) but anyway i read it and now i want more. This book has got me reading for the hell of it and i am purchasing Dune Messaih and Children of Dune and can't wait to read them. Dune changed my outlook on reading with it's indept look at politics, treachery and the way these two twist together in the Dune. I love it.
1	A Lifetime Favorite: I love the original Dune books and have also enjoyed the new ones. I own the entire series and can't think of a better recommendation to give.
0	Kindle version: I have climbed out of bed to write this for you, because I can take it no longer. Whoever made the kindle version should be fired. The book itself is great. However, random missing spaces, extra spaces, italics that begin or end when they shouldn't, mis-spellings of stillsuit as "stulsuit"....Please, buy another version. This is an embarrassment to e-publishing....and you'd think with it being on the computer it'd be easier to check for errors. Guess not.Look elsewhere for your ebook copy of Dune.
0	Embarrassing Ebook: After reading the Kindle sample of this book, I have to agree with the many critical reviews of this edition. This is not a review of the writing, which is excellent, but of this electronic edition of the title.Aside from the fact that $15 for the electronic edition of a book that is over 40 years old and has already been widely published as a mass market paperback for for half the price is obscene, the quality of this Kindle edition is so horrible I would not want it if it was free. DUNE is one of the great classics of scifi literature but this ebook is an embarrassment to both the publisher and the author and I would urge anyone interested in reading this book to pass on this edition. Instead, find any one of the cheap tens of thousands of used copies that are easily available of this title.
1	DUNE is the book for our time: I was only 4 years old when I first saw the screen version of this book and then I was hooked. Granted I shouldn't have gotten interested in the book just because of the movie, but the movie went well with the book. It put a face to the all the characters that I was so fascinated with. DUNE should be a book that should be read in high school, and studied. There is a message for those who read the book and those who are die hard fans of Frank Herbert will understand and relate it to present day....
0	What was the point of this book again?: This book was a complete let-down from the first one. The ending was well done, but other than that I cannot find anything at all good about this book. The first half of the book is completely pointless, unlike the first book we don't need to know about the characters because they are basically the same. The only reason I finished this book was to read the next book.
1	No doubt about it!: One look at all these reviews will leave you with no doubt that this is one of the best science fiction stories ever told. But wait! The best is yet to come. There are five other books in the series. My advice, however, is to skip Dune Messiah and go right to Children of Dune. The second book isn't nearly as good as the first; the third is even better. Herbert's writing improved with age, and God Emperor of Dune, Heretics of Dune, and Chapterhouse: Dune will blow you away even if you just sort-of like the original Dune.
1	Dune: This is my favorite novel of all time. I have read and re-read it since I was a teenager. Frank Herbert was an absolute genius. Science fiction is not usually my favorite genre of reading but this is the exception. I have the entire collection of Dune books including the rare Dune Encyclopedia. A must read!
1	Interesting continuation.: Like dune, it is flawed, spending too much time on internal monologue and exposition better left to the reader. Also like Dune, it is brilliant in many ways--symbolism, philosophy, intrigue, etc. I think one of the reasons that people didn't like it as much as Dune was because they were expecting more of the same and got, instead, a very changed universe (with several contradictions). Sequels in far-future sci fi always lack the wonder of discovering a new world; but in a way, watching the development is just as fascinating. If you liked Dune, read Dune Messiah.
1	just a few steps to total enlightenment:1. Read the book during the summer-time2. Download the song "Final Dream" from the 80s movie "Dune"3. Immerse yourself in water and/or listen to the song.4. Break out in tears.This book will change your life forever. :)
1	Dune: Dune is one of the most inspirational sci/fi books that I hav ever read. The technology in the book seemed to be extremely none feasible to the recent human culture thst sorrounds us as a people. The story of the chosen one,Paul Mau'dib a man that was given to the fremen as there saviour. He was the chosen one, the only male that could stand to the poisonious juice that only the benajesuits have the power as women to resist the power of the jui ce in order to become one of there own. As the story went on thw character of mau'dib feel in tot he world of the fremen and wanted to help them out of there fight for freedom . He was the only one that could do it for them. If he didn't do it he would just be wasting his talent. His talent to control the world in his fingers. He do it all he had the people afraid of what he could do , and it was all over one little insignifacant thing. He now controls the spice and will for a long time never be harmed.
1	Just the Best: Honestly, this book is one of the best I have ever read.(I have read a lot of books). Its plot, characterization and flawless storytelling make for one compelling read.
1	Not the best book ever, but it is up there.: This book made me order the rest of the series, and even tempted me to buy the ones written by his son, despite the horrible reviews they've been given on here. You will lose yourself in the world Mr. Herbert spins. The 2 movies made from this book don't do it justice.
0	An over-rated piece of fiction: I had several close friends recommend Dune to me, all proclaiming how amazing it was as a novel, only to hear later that not one of them finished it for the same reason: "it was kinda boring." If you're asking yourself why someone would praise and recommend a book that they find to be boring then you're just as mystified as I am. I have yet to meet anyone who has read Dune who liked it or ever finished it.The books major problem is it has too many minor characters and very poor character development. The lead character, Paul, is a good example, as he has no personality, or any interesting qualities whatsoever. Sadly, all the characters are this way.I did finish this book, after forcing myself to keep reading for six months, and I will say that it eventually does get more interesting, but only in the last two chapters.
1	Warm and self sacrificing: Jane and Tom meet fall in love and there are many obstacles to overcome. Different ending bittersweet. Loved it. Will not tell all as it will ruin the movie.
0	Horribly Disappointing: First, I will be upfront: I didn't get very far in this movie. There are few movies that I will stop in the middle (in fact, I can't think of any), but this was one of them. I was very disappointed with this movie. It makes fun of Jane Austen. It criticizes everything about Jane Austen's time period. Everything in the movie seemed designed to mock, from the pond filled with scum in front of a great house to an unpolished mirror that could hardly be looked in to show the sisters reflections. It blatantly attacks Christianity ( or being faithful to your spouse before you ever even meet them, by keeping your wedding vows). As strange as it sounds, I felt like I was being attacked through the movie screen. It is a movie full of lies. Particularly the lie that by being faithful to your spouse you are missing out. The opposite is true. Hopefully, the movie improved by the end, but I couldn't make it that far to find out.
1	Curl up and enjoy on a Rainy Day with a Cup of Tea.: If you remotely enjoy Jane Austin's works, this story is sure to please. Anne Hathaway is stunning and believable as Jane Austin. James McAvoy portrays young Jane's love interest and their chemistry is fantastic. Romantic, witty, Sad, funny, passionate - all things that make a great "chick" flick. You'll wish it wouldn't end. One word to the wise - Don't subject your husbands / boyfriends to this movie or you'll never hear the end of it.
1	GREAT MOVIE: Anne Hathaway did a great job as Jane Austin and this movie stayed very true to her real life (what we know of it anyway).
0	Contrived and so far from what we know about Jane Austen it is impossible to make the leap: This is no "Mrs. Brown." It is a fictitious assumption about Jane Austen and her paramours made into a romantic tale that hardly holds up with plot contrivances galore and the inevitable heartbreak. Watch it once then forget that you did. It is harmless.
1	one word: unbelievable: this is truly the most compelling book on commercial office space that i have read, and i have read all of them. It is short,concsice and to the point.Tunis captures the essence of what it means to negotiate for a piece of space and delivers it in a way that the layman can understand even the more complex points. A one of a kind book that i would heartily recommend for anybody looking to get in the commercial real estate field or just searching for office space.
1	Greaat Movie: This is a great movie!Its1969. Alan Parish has troubles with his father. He finds a game named Jumanji at a construction site. He plays with his former friend Sarah Whiddle. They play, and until the game reads 5 or 8, in the jungle he must wait. The game isn't played until 26 years later by a young girl and boy that will be living in the Parish home. Peter, the young boy, rolls a 5, or 8, and he is unleashed. This wild movie is all in one day! It turns out they can not play until Sarah Whiddle joins. They find her and the whole town, including her try to believe it was the father that killed him. I hate to say it, but the ending is sad. Once they finish the game, it should all dissappear. Robin Williams isn't the only one relased from the game. Who else? Go buy it now!
1	My Son's FAvorite: I did not see this movie in the theatre, but we rented it last year on video and really enjoyed it. Surprisingly, however, my 5-year-old son was wild about it! I had heard it was too scary for young kids, but he loved it. In fact, it has become one of his all time favorite movies, and we have rented it so many times (at his request) that we're going to buy the video for him for Christmas. The special effects in this movie are great, and (unlike the professional reviewers), I think the character development is fine. I think reviewers forget that sometimes people watch movies just for entertainment and fun!
1	Jumanji is fun!: What a great movie and a clever concept! A board game that sucks you into it, and must be finished by the originals who played the game. I remember seeing Jumanji in the movie theatre when it first came out, and this past weekend had the opportunity to rewatch it (thank you resale DVDs!)Starring Robin Williams and Bonnie Hunt, the action is fast paced and easy to follow. No swearing in this movie makes it appropriate for all ages, though little ones might be frightened by the rampaging animals. There is nothing Disneylike in their qualities.Still, the story of sticking together and teamwork prevail throughout the entire film. Bebe Neuwirth and David Alan Greier are great in their supporting roles. Bonnie Hunt gets some of the best lines in the film with regards to cheating and a downtown sale. An early Kirstin Dunst is also great.If you have never seen Jumanji, I encourage you check it out. It's fun and you always wonder what the game is going to come up with next.
1	Day-Timer stand: I was tired of having to pick up my Day-Timer every time I wanted to view it, with this stand I can leave it at the corner of my desk and view it at an easy angle to see without ever having to pick it up. It is sturdy enough to write on and has storage space below for stationary & letterhead. My only complaint is the high price, I would have bought a different brand if I could have found the same thing cheaper.
0	So where's the rest of it????: I was intrigued by the now cancelled TV show and so decided to pick up the book that the show was based on so I could have some closure on the story. Unfortunately, the book is nothing more than a lead in to the show. The books ends about where the show picks up. Needless to say I am still in the dark about where the story goes and how it ends. Very frustrating. It was a decent book up to the abrupt and unsatisfying ending.
0	a sorry bit of commercialism: I should have known better after the "Rose Red" trash. This is a cheap ploy to sucker you in to watching the series. Not only that , I've noticed Stephen King's current writing is concerned more with his pet peeves, political leanings, and predjudices than with telling a good story. Maybe it is time for King to retire.
1	Great toy! Great service!: I ordered this for my daughter because she lost her other 'Scat' beanie baby. It is a very durable toy. The order came quickly in the mail and in very good shape.
0	Fuel Pump: Though I'm sure that this pump would've operated properly,,, I was Extremely Disappointed that the Carter pump that was sent to me, looked NOTHING like the pump in the picture (instead, it was the newer style, bolt-together type),, and when you're trying to restore an old Mustang and the pump is suppose to appear a certain way (like in the advertised picture), that's what you expect to receive. It's all about the details!Doug S.
0	Plays but is noisy: This is noisy CD player it makes a whiring sound when CD's are played. Terrible fast forward and backwards, goes to slow. Awkward to use. Worst CD player I have ever owned. Don't buy it, you'll be sorry.
0	This book is being revised - so the FACTS can be adjusted: I started reading it, but couldn't continue when I found out that the "Facts" were being altered by Kerry and Brinkley. In the meantime, read "Unfit for Command". It gives several excerpts from this book anyway. Then maybe when the new version of the NON fiction comes out I'll read it. Although, I thought NON fiction was truth and truth couldn't be changed... I guess it depends on whose truth it is. I gave it one star because it's pretty thick and I think it probably took a lot of imagination to come up with that much.
0	Kerry's Tour Of Duty For North Vietnam: The book has no information on Kerry's "tour of duty" with Hanoi Jane and her gang.Nothing on how North Vietnam's leader dredit Kerry & Fonda for saving North Vietnam from defeat. Nothing on how Kerry's family financial benefitted from the normalization of relations with his old comrades in the "new" Vietnam.
0	Not a hero.: Offshore for so long in his first tour. Then back for only four months, received minor wounds, got medals and "out" while others slogged through jungle in the real war.....Kerry is no hero. A biased book the purpose of which is to win an election, not to give a true account of the war.Kerry came back and accused our soldiers of hideous acts of cruelty and murder; he testitied to these facts while our men were still there. Some of them were even being held prisoners by the enemy at the time. How do you think they were treated by the enemy after hearing what our soldiers did to their people?A disgusting excuse for an objective book. SAVE YOUR MONEY.
0	Campaign for Kerry: To call this book an unbiased look at Kerry's life is extremely naive. From the very beginning it reads like a cheesy campaign commercial. If you like Kerry and his politics, you'll like the book, conversely if you don't, you won't.
0	Waste of time and money: This book is a waste of valuable paper. Kerry is a freaking traitor and only received commendations because he had friends in high places. To anyone who supports him and his too obvious lies, you're dumber than I thought Americans ever would be. Kerry didn't do any more than any of our boys are doing out there every day, and less than most. I hated the book and have no respect for the man behind it.
0	Shame on Amazon.com's Political Bias: The following disclaimer appears on the "Unfit for Command" Swift boat book:"Important note from Amazon.com: We've decided to suspend our normal customer review policies and rules for this title. For example, we usually prohibit ad hominem attacks. That policy in particular seems to be incompatible with presidential election year politics. Therefore, short of obscenities, reviews on this book are now a free-for-all. We take no responsibility for the following discussion. Aren't presidential election years great? Have fun!"Why is there no such disclaimer issued for this book? It seems that Amazon's political bias is showing! Shame! Shame! Shame!Until this same disclamer appears under "Tour of Duty" I will take my book buying business elsewhere!
1	Liberals Read This Book!: A Masterpiece!Reviewer: A reader from New York, United StatesTo say that this is an informative easy read is to grossly understate thefacts. I have been a lifelong democrat...ok a liberal democrat. I alwaysjust assume that all of these guys are just Rush Limbaugh clones, allsinging from his hymnal. A friend of mine convinced me to read this book andI must admit...I have started to re-think some of my views. This guy stateshis opinion & gives you the FACTS to back it up...it's hard to dispute whathe says. I'm still a democrat (notice I left the "d" lower case), but nolonger consider myself a liberal...I can't believe it myself...READ THISBOOK!
1	what a world: A friend of mine recommended this CD to me and I have to admit it was way beyond anything I ever imagined. I have practically worn the CD out listening to it and hanging on every surreal nuance within the deep lyrics and the haunting music. Being a sax player myself, I was especially inspired by how fat the sounds of the saxaphones are......absolutely incredible!
1	Chilling!: I've been a Morphine fan for quite a while. And when I heard the news of Mark Sandman's (the singer)death, I feared the worst...NO MORE MEZMERIZING BEAUTY from the guys of Morphine. I recieved "The Night" on its release date and listened to it three times right away. While as a whole, While The Night is not the best of "Morphine's" albums (this album is different enough to be in a category itself)...there are songs on the disc that will become legendary to Morphine fans. The album is simply "Chilling". You get the usual Morphine dose of sax, bass, drum and VOICE...but with a new twist. There are some unique sounds on this album that just adds to the sad feeling one gets when the thought reaches the brain: "Where would Morphine had gone if Mark Sandman had not traveled into THE NIGHT?" Thank you Mark...for the beauty.
0	Dangerous!: I have tried this item a few times and learned:The strainer top does not hold tight to the cooker, nor is there anything in the design of the cooker part to permit the strainer top to attach to it. This means that when you tip the cooker over to pour out the water, the top falls off! Danger of scalding and steam burns!It worked adequately for rice vermicelli, which one would normally just soak in boiling water anyway. When I tried it with penne, the pasta pieces on the bottom of the container didn't even get wet from the hot water, never mind cooked! I still had to remove the pasta at the end of the so-called cooking time, and transfer it to a pot of boiling water in order to get it cooked!This so-called pasta cooker is a waste of time. Not a waste of money if you want to have a plastic vase for long-stemmed flowers... that's what you can safely use it for!
0	Misleading information: I used to geocache and so I read this book with interest. The information is misleading ("GPSr: Slang of a GPS receiver." An initialism is hardly "slang") to slightly dangerous (the author recommends turning off the GPS for most of your trek to "save batteries." Instead of losing your breadcrumb trail back to your camp or car, why not just carry spare batteries?).It appeared to me that the author had never really spent much time geocaching. Take his advice with a grain of salt.
1	A Classic: This is a movie that my mother took me and my siblings to when it first came out. I remember loving the title and thinking it would be really scary since it was about murder and death. What I remember most about it is Maggie Smith saying, "Dickie! Where's my Dickie?!" I bought it for sentimental reasons. It's a really great movie, if only for all the stars that appear. It's also got Truman Capote, who is strange and wonderful. It's got lots of twists and turn. The introduction is a little long - the piece where everyone arrives at the mansion. It's a little gimicky, but it's Neil Simon, so that's to be expected. Would I recommend it to others? Sure. Was I a tiny bit disappointed that it was not as wonderful as I remember it? Sure. The last thirty years made it a little better in my mind than it actually is. It's got some good extras, but not as many as I generally like. But it's a good nostalgia pick and there are some great performances.
1	This is one funny movie!!: This movie is hilarious!! I found it amazing because this film was truely a pionear of its genre(parody). This was before Lethal weapon and even before the movie "Clue" it is indeed one of the first of its kind.It follows the same basic premise as most other murder mystery movies but it turns all of the stereotypes on their head.For example-The butler is blind and this is but one many things that make this movie unique. You can tell the producer and director had a lot of fun making this one.The first time you watch it you can have a dozen different guesses for how the movie turns out but you will not be right. I love this movie!!
1	personal top #10: If you haven't had the chance to see it then trust me and please buy it! Laughs are assured!!
1	Great comedy from before foul language: This movie has always been a favorite of mine. I originally saw it when it came out, and remember all the crazy stuff that went on. Later it became a thing where we would rent it every so often and watch it, waiting for certain parts. It draws on a great cast, a strange script, and sets that fit the storys mood. Its a film that would never be made today because they would never bring in so many great actors, and hire a top notch screenplay writer. Its easier now to just get one known actor, or a script that relies on foul language and gross jokes with whoever starring in it. I enjoy that type of movie too, but this is not like that. This is a fun movie, thats the best way to describe it.
0	Pathetic Attempt at Bond: This film is awful. The plot is a twisted Bond-film scenario with only difference being that Disel isn't a professional spy, but recruited by the US Government because he appears to be tough and, at the same time, a criminal. The special effects were okay, but very predictable and hardly believable. The film also had some lines from previous Bond films, and even some screen shots that looked awfully similar to some of the past Bond movies. But Diesel is no Bond. He ... as a spy, and is an awkward actor at that.
0	<*** This movie is BAD! ****>: I was able to see this movie in Europe for free and let me just say it was terrible; big explosions, and big stunts are the only dosis you'll be getting, because as far as a good story or a bit of acting is concerned not a chance!...unless showing off your muscles every second can be call acting.Vin Diesel is one of the worst actors I've ever seen, I wish Hollywood would give a chance to real actors who are just waitingfor the opportunity.Please don't allow this to continue, bad movies must be stopped once and for all.Rent this movie if it makes you happy but don't be another victim, or worst yet another supporter of this movie.
0	Top10 reasons you saw "XXX":10.You're a girl that has a crush on Vin Diesel 9.You're a kid that has no idea who James Bond is. 8.You're a serious movie goer looking for comedy relief. 7.You thought it was rated XXX. 6.You're a student from the USC film class "Bad Movies101". 5. You had nothing better to do with your time and money. 4.You're a first-time moviegoer that was tricked by your15-year-old sister. 3.You're a critic that's in hot water with his boss. 2.You believe that the WWF and WCW is a real sport.1.That Vin Diesel guy is hot even if he can't act.
1	Please! It's Entertainment Not Reality!: There's only one reason to see this movie. Entertainment. It's just that simple. If you're looking for profound, this whole movie genre isn't it. If your looking for fast paced action, witty dialogue, an edgy sound track that compliments the plot... a wild, unique approach to stunts, and a totally unconventional, irreverent "secret agent"... then this movie is for you.Vin Diesel makes a very entertaining, believable Xander Cage, but give him a break...this isn't a Shakespeare movie! It's a spy movie and does follow the genre rules, but not enough to make it like any other. Don't take it too seriously and enjoy the ride!
0	Mindless, Pointless and Insulting: Bad. Just plain awful. Please skip this mindless drivel. The only people who liked this film are girls who think that Vin Diesel is "cute" and people who liked "Fast & The Furious" (another snoozer). I am glad that I saw it on my friend's PC and not at the theaters, so that I didn't waste $7.50. Anyone who watched this film and was not insulted by its mindnumbing dialogue, horrid plot and overall crudeness should be ashamed of themselves. Not even Jean Claude himself could have saved this one. A total waste of time for the thinking movie goer. Hey kiddies, here's an idea; instead of watching this why not see a top-notch film like "Far From Heaven" or "The Hours" or even "Minority Report"? Oh, thats right, gotta use the old noggin for that one....never mind. It saddens me that movies have come to this.
0	head for the XXX-it: I've only ever walked out of one movie, and this was it. I actually stayed for an hour, hoping it'd get better...but it actually got worse. The acting: bad, the stunts: bad, the plot: VERY bad. I wouldn't wish seeing this movie on my worst enemies (even thogh I have none). Save your money, send it to Sally Struthers or something.
0	Unleaded: Probably one of the most pointless films with one of the most pointless stars of today....and the best thing is we can expect a sequel. Could someone please explain to me the appeal of Vin? I mean, he did show some promise in far superior films like Pitch Black and Saving Private Ryan but enough already.
0	Triple Bad!!!: This movie doesn't even deserve one star. Vin Diesel is the worst actor. For ANYBODY to call him the "new James Bond" is sad and laughable. Say what you want about Roger Moore's performances as James Bond, Vin Diesel could NEVER compare to him and he was the worst James bond ever!! The stunts in this movie are awesome, but the acting and plot is HORRIBLE!! I felt ashamed that I watched this movie because it insulted my intelligence. This movie was SO bad and to think it was a block buster hit!!! Vin is sexy (although he sometimes force it), but nothing and I do mean NOTHING should excuse him for making this mess. C'mon Vin, do better next time!!
0	HORRIBLE!!!!!!: Well i saw this movie on the night of its release... Just like most women in this world I am a HUGE VIN DIESEL fan... I saw him in the Fast and the Furious, Pitch Black, Boiler Room,and so on. I was SADLY DISSAPOINTED by this movie. It was long and dry. The funny parts were few and far between, and there was sooo much action in it that it was almost UNBEARABLE to watch. Between the mediocre acting and the tired fighting scenes. It leaves u drained. NOT VIN DIESELS FINEST HOUR I WILL SAY..
1	Good introductory real options book for beginner or manager: It is a good introductory book on real options targeted at the audience of managers rather than experienced financial practitioners. Its contents covered financial options, binomial pricing and Black-Scholes model where the last ten chapters or so are case studies dedicated to applications of real options where it gives readers an idea how real options can be applied in diverse industries.It makes a good and easy read for anyone who wants a quick flavor of real options without going through too much of the horrible maths that derivatives and real options seems to have !I personally enjoy reading it from cover to cover.
1	An American Classic: Although this extremely gifted author did an excellent job, a bit wordy for me. Just dont have the time to read this style of writing.
1	Captivating: Been listening to the book for the last two weeks so I feel like I'm family. Doesn't get 5 stars because it gets a little too in love with its own voice, but for the most part a really good audio book.
0	deplorable: this was the worst example of american literature ever published. warren feels the need to describe such trivial objects as doorknobs, the color of the street, or smell of the rain. is this really needed? this book could have easily been condensed into one half its size. the author's continuing mention of "The Great Twitch" has no impact on the average person's life. this book is a waste of your time, don't read it!
0	Pointless: This book was profane and pointless, as is w/ most books I'm forced to read for English. I never knew being in AP ment I had to put up with my beliefs being violated. DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!
1	Extremely unappreciated: This is definately one of the most underrated books of all time. Many will believe that this book is about politics, but it is about life. Robert Penn Warren creates Jack Burden, a character who is more like a spectator then one who actually lives life. The writing style is wonderful, and some of the lines in this novel are extremely well written and created. I highly recommend this book to anyone who can survive the first chapter, it is definately worth it. Many themes can also be drawn from this book, a book that you will be thinking about long after you have finsihed.
0	Thou Preachest Too Much!: This book has a preachy tone that current readers will find hard to take but at the core of this book there are useful truths and insights into the learning process. For the good student, this book will confirm what he or she already knows and may add a few additional touches to personal trouble spots. For the average to poor student, it may be hard to get past the school marmish tone to get to "the goods" this book has to offer. I'm afraid in today's environment, this book won't reach those who need it the most.
1	Ladies & Gentlemen...it's The Rolling Stones!: I'm not the most analytical reviewer out there for some of you who want a "well-reasoned", "logically-based", "original", "thought-provoking" review. I simply like what I hear or I don't. But I love music and certain bands I have loved for 40 years. The Rolling Stones is one of them. I picked up the CD simply because it was the Rolling Stones. I listened to it and from the first it sounded just EXCELLENT. They kept to the formula and then spiked it! I'm not going to compare it to past albums, or group line-ups or anything. I cannot tell you if it is better or worse than other albums. This one just stands on it's own! If you do love the Rolling Stones, you will be floored! Let me just tell you that in their golden years, the Stones still had the "stones" to pull it off again. You pick this CD up for the heck of it, and you walk away100% satisfied that you got your money's worth, and unlike Mick, YOU GET SATISFACTION! What a superb rocker!
1	This is a great album, a thrilling display of funky brilliance and virtuosity.: You should listen to this album many many times, like for a whole evening, sipping Martinis or Margaritas or whatever you like to drink. It's one of their greats, along with "Some Girls", "Exile on Main Street" and the others. This one is notable for the funky guitars, the jazz influence, and Keith Richards sounding like he's singing in Humphrey Bogart's bar in "Casablanca". Most importantly, this album appears to have been very carefully made, with a tremendous shot of inspiration, and it gets better every time you hear it.
1	say YES to THE STONES: THE STONES WERE A GREAT BAND AND ALMOST AS GOOS AS THE BEATLES.ALL THEIR ALBUMS INCLUDING THIS ONE ARE CLASSICS.IGNORE THE ONE STAR REVIEWS AND BUY THIS ONE.
0	the same thing.....: The rolling stones are making the same music from 20 ago....and now..as multi-millionaries, they are playing to rebels..writting songs about bush etc...Ths is the only way to call the media attention?
0	YUK..............: Are they still alive? This CD stinks!!!! They are living off Media Baby Boomers Hype!!! When was the last time they had a hit1970?
0	What a Bunch of Trash!: I have been patiently waiting for some new Stones and what do I finally get, this group of songs some south Philly garage band could have written. What a disgrace for the Stones to put out this Lousy album. I am deeply disturbed buy the fact that people are giving this rave reviews just because it's a Stones album. Be ashamed, Be very ashamed of yourselves for telling people this CD is worth their hard earned cash!
0	Oh, Pleeeze: The lyrics on Biggerbang are so bad! If you have a brain, you will cringe. "...i'm just one of your cocks": How old are you guys!? Musically it's pretty rockin and tight. I wish you could turn down Jagger, not because of his singing which is really good but because the lyrics seem like they were written by a fourteen year old with a big ego.
0	This CD reminds me of a not good CD: I was definately not ready for the disappointment I suffered when I decided to buy this instead of another Tom Waits CD. I was very sorry to see that the early music by the Cherry Poppin' Daddies was just as god-awful as all the other alternative music that I hate.I like mittens!
1	Another winner: Another winner for Jance in the Joanna Brady series. I have read all of the books in the series and am currently reading the next installment, Dead Wrong. I love the Joanna Brady series and will not miss one. Jance has got a real winner here. I like this series far more that the J.P. Beaumont series. Also, there is no need to read the other books in the series before picking up this one. Jance brings everyone up to speed without any confusion if you start a book in the middle of the series. Great characterizations and storyline.
1	TL!: Bought this cd many, many years ago. I can't truthfully name one song from it, but I will vouch for Tracy Lawrence, he's a good singer!!
0	OK, but there's better stuff out there for the money: ....I think this thing is sortof nice the way it has an integrated Tape and CD, but generally I think it is really crappy compared to the Turtle Beach Audiotron. Granted that unit is designed to be connected to a real stereo, and not imitate a real stereo like this unit, but the support for formats, and features is 400% better on that unit.The Audiotron is also able to play icecast and shoutcast...
0	Big Disappointment: Anyone who saw the stage production of JOSEPH AND THE AMAZING TECHNICOLOR RAINCOAT must be disappointed by the movie. The main problem is the staging of it as a play at a school, resulting in unrealistic and cutesy scenes of kids worshipfully smiling at singing adults. The music is good, but the narrator makes faces, and Danny Osmond with long hair and half-shaven looks like he just woke up from sleeping on the street. My advice if you have this video is to close your eyes, and just listen to the music.
0	thumbs down: All the children magically popping up, some bad makeup, and a few sad tries at being funny is what makes this movie deserve such a low rating. I think they could have come up with a better Joseph than D. O.. I have seen it 6 times in live theater, and every time the show was better than the movie.
1	Improves with age...: I thought this was a pretty good video. In response to one comment, I also wasn't wild about Maria Friedman compared to Laurie Beechman, but I warmed up to her on my second viewing. As for alternatives, a great choice would have been Liz Callaway, formerly of Cats, Anastasia, etc. Also, I don't know how much more complete this version could have been, other than the megamix, which was irrelevant anyway. If you have a choice, get the DVD because the documentary is worth watching.
1	Joseph ...: All I have to say is that I love it! The music is awesome, still love Donny Osmond and he's excellent in this production.
1	Best Musical of All Time: Nothing better than learning a Bible Lesson through so much entertainment. I wish there were more DVD's out like this. Enjoy!
1	Can't get enough!!!!!: I have seen a few broadway shows in the past, but when I saw Joesph for the first time in Salt Lake City I was blown away. I instantly went out and bought the DVD and every Sunday my family and sit down and watch it togather. The set up with the school kids watching the show in the school auditorium magical and touching. Go Go Donny and I hope to see you in Salt Lake city again.
0	Can we say "overproduced"?: I agree wholeheartedly with Donald-from-Ohio's review. I've been a fan of this Lloyd Weber/Rice musical for 20+ years and have seen it grow as songs were added and various recordings made available. Having never had the opportunity to see the stage production, I was eager to see this video. Now I realize that perhaps this musical is one to be heard and not seen, at least not beyond an unpretentious summer camp or youth group presentation, the perfect venues for this show. Yes, Osmond performs nicely in the role of Joseph. But everything else about this production is so overdone that watching it, for me, is like seeing a favorite childhood friend grow up to become a cheap circus performer. The two stars I give this video are for the music itself. But I certainly don't understand why Lloyd Weber chose to add the FINALE song "Any Dream Will Do" to the BEGINNING of the show.
0	Not for Children: Donny Osmond was wonderful as always, the female lead was not as strong as the CD. This video is not for children. The costumes in the Pharoah's scene are offensive and in poor taste.
1	Joseph and the Amazing Tecno Dreamcoat is the best!: I have wanted to see this musical for the last year, and was overjoyed when I heard that 'Great Performances' would be showing it on April 5th. After a gruling two weeks, the big day came. I watched with unblinking eyes trough the entire show. I thought it was one of the greatest shows I have ever seen on 'Great Performances', apart from 'Cats' of course. If I could give it higher then 5 stars, I would. Though the Mrs. Potiphar's scene I have to admit was a little on the personal side, it didn't really show anything. Her servents costumes were NOT see through, they were just white mesh with extremly small holes between the fabric thread. I would recomond this to anyone that wants to watch and listen to a really upbeat musical that you just have to get up and dance to. If I could find it on video around my town and if I had the money to buy it, I would.
1	The whole family enjoys it!: I saw Joseph for the first time about 4 years ago, and wondered why I waited so long to see it. I took my older children (then aged 8 & 9) to see it two years later--they loved it, too! They insisted I buy the soundtrack CD (also an awesome thing to have), and now my three year old bops around the house singing, "Go, go, go Joseph!" Good music, great lyrics, a great evening for the entire family! A must for Andrew Lloyd Weber fans of all ages.
1	Eye-opening version... Re-orchestrated?: This is a superb visualisation of the show based on the early 90's London Revival with Jason Donovan and (subsequently) Philip Schofield. The production was then moved to the US where Donny Osmond took the title role for 6 or 7 years. This version owes a lot to the original London Revival production. The Canaan sets and the Pharoah sets are practically identical to those of the stage version, just fleshed out a bit. The jail and Potiphar's offices are a new departure, with a triangular theme in black, white and silver. What impressed me the most, though, was the huge involvement of the chorus in this production. The chorus work also seems to have been augmented, with additional harmony lines and dances. All in all, a reaffirmation of the stage as a medium, even in video form! Enjoy!
1	Amazing Things About Joseph: This movie was amazing! I've seen the play and own the CD, and this was by far better. The cast has so much fun with their roles that the audience can't help but enjoy the performance. Donnie Osmond was made for this role, and Maria Friedman shines as the Narrator. I saw another review that said this was racy and distasteful for children, but I found it no more inappropriate than the live performance, and the scenes in question are over so fast, children will hardly have time to question it. I think it's great for the whole family, musical-lovers and nonmusical-lovers alike! I expected it to be the taping of a live performance, and was dreading the poor quality that is unavoidable in such cases, like extreme facial closeups, and bad lighting. What a surprise this was! It was nothing like I expected, and better than I hoped!
0	Buy the soundtrack instead.: Joseph lovers; you will be disappointed with this film. Family viewing it is not. Potiphar's wife and her servants are definitely R rated, and you may be embarrassed to watch this with your children. The narrator is breathy and sexy, which may work in some venues, but not when she is narrating a Bible story to a grade school assembly. Rent it and get it over with, but you'll probably grate at the slow musical pace.
1	I really like: the story being told. The actors are pretty good and they can definitely sing. The biggest reason I purchased this DVD is the singing.
1	A must have for aspiring colorists and lettering: This is by far the most informative book I have come across for lettering and coloring comics. it gives you step by step instructions on how to scan your art, prep it in photoshop, color it, letter it and finally the clean up process. heck, it even goes into how to submit it to the publisher. it also gives non step by step info on things such as color theory and the use of photoshop filters. WAY better than any Marvel book i've read so far.
0	Okay but short of expectations: I got this book to accelerate my knowledge, but I decided that it s not as good as other books of the same kind. Namely, Hi-Fi Guide to coloring Comics, and the lettering book by Comicraft. I got this book because its a book about DC comics, my personal favorites, and I thought I would get better direction on how to "do these things like they do" Sadly this just isnt the case. The direction is just a skimming off the top and gives great history, but actually I have yet to find anything helpful in it. The Comicraft lettering book gives you step by step in Illustrator; and once you learn it it sticks in your mind. Simple as that. The hi fi book, gives instruction and comes with hady texture maps to give your colors more appeal. I would probably recommend this book to younger artists14 and below. Maybe this was the age bracket it was intended for?
1	Some people...: This was a very funny movie. I saw it awhile back and was just curious as to what other people thought. The guys that gave it 3-5 stars definitely got it right. I was reading the1-star reviews and just got pissed off. What's wrong with people? What were you expecting from this movie? It was loaded with hilarious scenes. You got these clowns bad mouthing the movie I suppose because I guess it wasn't a groundbreaking thought provoking movie. Get out of your own asses
1	Much Respect: If you thought Bleed's debut was hot, your gonna get roasted to this. "My Own" has a different sound than his first record, but that's what makes it great. He uses lots of samples from the 70's giving it southernplayalistic style that's unmatched. The message conveyed through his lyrics is more than just a mission about money and cheese and thuggin'. Ghetto celebrities Too Short and Daz found their way onto this record, but they are an afterthought. The narcotic effect of Bleed's southern drawl and story telling ability that spawned his first record just accelerates on My Own. Get this if you want to "listen" to a message, not just "hear" words.
0	Stuff is great but don't buy here: Cha Cha Mix is definitely tasty, but don't buy it in bulk here because it turns rancid and you can't return food to Amazon. The first few bags were super but bag five, which was still in code, tasted nasty, as did bag six. I didn't open any more and contacted Harmony and they sent me a coupon for a free bag but that doesn't make up for the eight yucky ones I'm stuck with.
1	Awesome.... for the year that it was made: Texas Chainsaw Massacre is a very good movie... What really got me was the fact that it was based on a true story. TCM#1 was the best out of all of them. #4 was the Lamest of all of them...but opinions vary.
0	The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (Blu-ray): I was very excited to see that the movie arrived within a couple of days of purchase. However, I was not able to watch the movie for almost a month later due to our remodling of our living room witch houses our surround sound and tv. The blu-ray is just a copy of the dvd that came out a few years ago, but I was fine with that since I did not own the dvd. The movie was awesome and still scary just as i remembered it since i last saw it when i was a teen. To my great excitement came sadness when I wanted to see the special features and they did not work!!!!! I cliked on them over and over and nothing, it just brought me back to the main screen again and again. I don't know if this has happened to anybody else, or is my copy a dud.
1	THIS is horror!: No matter how many times I've watched this movie, I'm scared sh**less. I love movies that can scare me even after watching them a million times.Watching all the extras on the DVD didn't help, either. I watched all the Deleted Scenes, the Bloopers, even put an alternative soundtrack on the movie (with Gunnar Hanson, Tobe Hooper, and a production designer narrating) and it still scares me.Oh, I can handle my horror but The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is one of those films that stays with you and refuses to leave. Today's sick jokes of horror films have nothing on Tobe Hooper, Wes Craven, Dario Argento, or the rest of the horror masters.
1	THE SAW IS FAMILY.: I remember when i was about ten watching this movie the one thought i couldn't get out of my mind is that this [stuff] really happend. From the moment that creepy guy jumps in there van and starts talking about how he worked in a slaughter house and then starts cuttin on his self the movie has your attention. I really dont know what else to say that hasn't allready been said so i just want to say love this DVD. 5/5.
0	Widescreen yes, anamorphic, No.: This is great if you have a 27 inch 4:3 Cathode Ray TV but if you have a16:9 HDTV, beware, it will look terrible.Yes, the "supervised by Tobe Hooper" picture is great, on a small screen but the DVD is in 4:3 Letterbox not16:9 Anamorphic so you have to "zoom" it to watch on an HDTV and it will look terrible. It's like putting in an old VHS cassette, one that's really deteriorated.I am waiting, anxiously, for a real widescreen version for the modern HDTV audience.
1	so scary: im young and this movies scared me for years i never have gone or looked at any supodley abandod houses very creepy a true horror film.
1	Absolutely terrifying: I skipped this one during its drive-in days, but I caught up with it on video in the 80s. I was so primed to be scared that I watched it on a sunny Saturday afternoon with all the lights on. And it STILL scared the bejesus out of me. You'd be surprised by how little gore there actually is and by how willing Hooper is to sustain the length of a scene until you think you'll leap out of your skin with anxiety. The final shot against the rising sun is maybe my pick for the most memorable of any horror film. It seemed to sum up everything that went before plus make you (a) rethink it while you're (b) not sleeping that night.
1	Good, but sometimes disturbing: THIS is a HORROR movie. In the same vein as "Last house on the left". Well directed and not for sissy horror fans that think "Scream" is the first slasher film. Yeah thats a "good" movie. But, if ya think "that" movie contains the same if not "equal" shock value, you need to crawl out of your hole and rent or buy this movie and see what has been stolen{ from such a fine director}.The acting is so amateur that it works in both the comedic range and the serious.The makeup is incredibly real, so that if it had been done in black and white, the film would have been just as effective. And the camerawork, nothing less than brilliant. It's up there with "Psycho" the original [Hitchcock] as well as the remake [Gus Van Sandt] This is real Hideyoureyes terror.Made to be "Watched Alone" in the dark.In the daylight as well.Beware the Meathook
1	The Greatest Horror film of all time !: Tobe Hooper's1974 landmark masterpiece debut "THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE" is by far the single most influential horror film of all time. This is the holy grail of horror movies! When i was a kid this movie changed my life,i've been a horror movie addict ever since! This film is the ultimate blue-print on how to make a great horror movie. There are many films that contain much more blood & gore then T.C.M. & to the eye of the beholder there may even be films out there that are more scary then T.C.M.(maybe!?!?) but what makes this film numero uno of all horror films is simpley the amount of influence it has contributed to the horror world & its this reason & this reason alone that "TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE" is the best there was,the best there is & the best there ever will be!
0	DUMB DUMB AND DUMB: this is by far the worse horror movie ever. the acting is pATHETIC, THE KILLER IS A total idiot, the camera footage suckz and theres no story line that goes with it, itz just about a guy that kills people with a chainsaw. i rented this movie and instantly regreted it. PLEAZE do not DO NOT buy this movie and if u do yer screwed
0	Mt Great-Great Uncle: I only bought this because my Great-great uncle, Ross Santee, was featured in it for about15 seconds. The video was made in1939, when color had just come out, and the quality of the color is awful. Shadows in people's faces are green. The story line is so basic any kid could predict the ending. Still, it was well worth $10 for me to have a tiny bit of memorabilia of my long-distant family member.
0	Despite great acting by De Niro, this movie sucks.: Let me start by saying that I had high hopes for this film. Some people praise it like it's as good as Taxi Driver. After watching it though, I have no clue what people see in this movie. It drags on and on and at some points of the film (espcially the middle) you really have no idea what is going on anymore. I almost felt like shutting it off a few times, but luckily De Niro's acting kept me from hitting the stop button.I'm sure when this movie came out it was shocking and disturbing, since there wasn't much like it back then. However, by today's standards it really falls flat on it's face. I would not recommend this film to anyone, although if you're really curious about it feel free to give it a try. Obviously there are those who like really bizarre pointless movies like this. Just don't say I didn't warn you!
0	All Star Cast.....But...: I saw this movie in my local video store, and I got excited. I saw huge names (Keitel, De Niro, Scorsese, what would YOU expect?) So I got home, called a couple of friends over, and we sat and watched this movie.This was possibly the most disappointing movie of all time. I'm not kidding at all. I seriously felt dumber after watching this movie; there was absolutely no plot. I don't know how all these people are prancing around calling it "one of the greatest hits of the '70s!" No.Keep in mind, I'm a HUGE Keitel, as well as De Niro fan. I was so disappointed with this movie; but the problem was, there was absolutely no plot, and no transition. The actors played their characters well, but there was no room for characters in the movie. It was a huge upset; 'travesty' does not do this movie justice. No plot, no culmination, no action, no transition, no STORY. Period.
1	Top Notch: This film is shot well, has a great soundtrack, and is definitely a great early piece by Scorsese. There's no real obvious plot line, but it's still a fun movie.
1	Great!: When I was a little kid. I would try to watch these movies but they really freaked me out. Now that im15 I had to give this one a try. Freddy's Dead was on television and once I saw one part with Freddy and Carlos(Carlo's ear) it freaked me out, but now I watched the whole movie of this and I have to buy the 8 disc box collection. I just special ordered it. This movie was really good. I can't wait to see all the other movies even that one part in Nightmare 6 with Carlos. Maybe this time I don't think it would be as bad, but I think everyone should give this movie a try. Wes Craven is very creative. I've seen his other work like Wishmaster1-4 and he's done pretty good job. Check this one out!
0	this is not a good movie: If your a die hard fan and saw them all, you may like it, otherwise be warned. It's not good, the twisting of reality with Robert Englund appearing as himself, and Wes Craven's cameo just didn't add the renewal of life that they had hoped. It's not really scary either, which I thought was kind of a requirement in these horror movies.
0	What was the point of this????: Talk about beating a dead horse. How much further can the Freddy thing get stretched? The idea of a character from the movies 'becoming real because he was so evil' is ludicrous at best. It would be like walking into 7-11 and bumping into Darth Vadar as you were filling up your Big Gulp. Robert Englund was happy to make this I'm sure, I mean after awhile people started calling him Freddy everywhere he went. What else was he gonna do, make Cereal or Laundry Soap commercials? Stick with the original series, this was stupid.
1	"He's Back!": Three years after the apparent death of the striped sweater wearing madman, original creator Wes Craven comes back to bring more fear to Elm Street! But this time, the terror doesn't stop at the screen. This is a movie inside of a movie. Freddy's coming into reality because the movies have ended. I love the return of the original cast members,i love the Freddy character in this movie more than i have since Part 4 because he's actually kind of frigtening again,and i think that the story is well executed. I commend you Wes Craven! But on a sad note, i miss the old Freddy look and i most certainly miss the "what the hell?" reaction i got watching the originals. Reality sort of complicates things. But hey, i like the movie... alot.
1	good: this is a really great movie it might even be the best in the series even if the first one in like this classic.
1	Queen of Hell: I only saw about a third of this movie, but i thought it rocked. And i think Freddy oughtta get a girl, just not Heather, as that one guy suggested. Anyway, my question is, how can a kid sleepwalk with his eyes open if he's completely aware of what's going on around him? Maybe i'm misintrepreting, but i saw this movie when i was nine, four years ago, and i recall Dylan sleepwalking into the middle of the street on his way home from the hospital, and Kreuger grabbing him from the sky. The kid was wide awake, so how the heck did Kreuger do it? I mightta missed something, though. I loved the movie, and i'm gonna work on that whole Bride of Kreuger idea this one guy had. Buh-bye.
1	Re-Discover Your Music Collection!: This is a fantastic product! I am NOT a "technical" guy, so I was a bit apprehensive when I ordered the CD Songwriter. Was I happily surprised! I took it out of the box, read the easy-to-follow directions, plugged it in and---immediately---I was rocking the house with LP's and cassettes I literally hadn't heard in years.The CD player and radio are likewise terrific---simple to use and the sound is great. Burning CD's (use blank CD-R's, not CD-RW's) is also a snap. A Rick Springfield cassette I bought in1985 sounds brand-new burned onto CD with the Crosley Songwriter. A Dylan Thomas poetry album my mom bought in the1950s likewise sounds crystal-clear on a newly-burned CD.I am so pleased with this Songwriter, I feel like a kid on Christmas morning! Baby Boomers & Gen-X'ers, treat yourselves to this wonderful machine and rediscover your music collection!
1	National Geographic "Africa" Series: Beautifully photographed. However, if you're interested in Africa from a political and historical standpoint, as I am, this is not really the video series for you.Excellent wildlife and nature footage (just as you'd expect from National Geographic) and even an attempt to convey some sociological lessons about "urban" vs. "tribal" differences.Overall, well worth watching, but don't look to it for very deep historical or political enlightenment about the continent.
1	If this CD doesn't perk you up, you're dead: A fun CD from beginning to end. Starts out with the radio hit "Zoot Suit Riot", a very catchy tune with plenty of brasswork that doesn't sound too serious or too contrived. The lyrics reflect the swing-era roots but contain modern phrases and topics (some a little risque). Very tight execution of the genre, every song has a little hook or element that is straight from the swing era. The lyrics are clever and descriptive with a lot of detail. A good CD for either serious headphone listening or to just put on in the background.
1	Damm Good Swing Cd.: This is a damm good swing cd. Don't listen to the other reviews saying that its Ska. There are only traces of Ska in tracks such as Dr Bones, and Pink Elephant. The band is excellent but they do have a habit of adding extra horns and a piano player don't get me wrong these sound great but it makes me wonder if they would sound as good live. As for the lyrics some may find them offensive but in that case don't buy the cd. My opinion? I thought that the lyrics fitted in well with the songs and the style of music. If you like Neo Swing and bands such as Big Bad Voodoo Daddy and Royal Crown Revue then this cd is defiantly for you.
0	You call this swing?: Listen up all you people who think you know swing. This ain't nothin'! This isn't swing, this is something I don't know with a name attached to it. You want some REAL swing try the classics, the real thing, like Benny Goodman, Glenn Miller, Gene Krupa, Artie Shaw, listen to them! the real thing! This is just a modern excuse for music.
1	This cd will make you want to get up and swing dance.: The songs are full of catchy phrases and brilliantly made. The Cherry Poppin' Daddies picked all the right hits to be on the album especially my favorite, Zoot Suit Riot.
1	Zoot Suit Riot is the best song on the album.: This album is pretty good...not as good as I had hoped. Zoot Suit Riot is definitely the greatest song on the album, other ones like "Come Back to Me" are also good. But it doesn't live up to the expectations I had. Overall a good album, but not perfect.
0	Wasn't very impressed, especially after all the hype.: I bought this cd after hearing the title song for the hundreth time on the radio, thinking maybe the whole cd would be as good. Boy, was I wrong. I would return it if Amazon would take an opened cd back!
1	THE best album of1998. Period.: The CPD's are by far the best band alive in America today. "Zoot Suit" is the best CD of the year. On stage, I have never seen a band more charged and on fire than the CPD's. All other swing is boring lounge music compared to Zoot Suit. Steve Perry is one of the top three lyric writers on my personal list, making their music all the more enjoyable. The lyrics are complex, intelligent, morally pointed, and clever. The music is rich, catchy, diverse, and incorporates more instruments than other swing bands. The CPD's are definitely not smooth and syrupy like other bland bands. They have the same demented, spastic gusto they started out with years ago, and are only going to get hotter. All other bands, including the "masters" of days-gone-by swing (with all due respect, of course), are left foundering in the wake of the CPD's.
1	oh yeah: with the great beat good lyrics and skilled players they are simply the best, the worst complaint ive heard is that you got to know a little about the 30's to get the lyrics, mista-s
0	Awful stuff: I agree with the two previous reviewers. This is indeed horrendous fake swing that doesn't hold a candle to the original masters. It is also GRATE (not great) modern swing!
0	Swinging and Swearing Don't Mix: These losers have a brain-dead idea. They trot out the old Swing/Jump sound of the '30s, then figure that in order to update it for the '90s, they'd better add some downer lyrics and foul language. This is the modern '90s idea of fun, I guess.No thanks. If I want to listen to Swing, I'll stick with the original masters. Do yourself a favor and buy a Duke Ellington, Fletcher Henderson, or even a Louis Prima CD, and you'll see how lame these neo-Swing pretenders are.
0	There's much better modern swing out there...: The swingin' sounds on this may rock, but the swingin' words on Zoot Suit Riot are simply awful. Abuse and swing just don't go together... this stuff is supposed to be FUN, not miserable. Go listen to the Squirrel Nut Zippers or Brian Setzer Orchestra instead.
1	Absolutely Love Hoku!: I bought Hoku's CD years ago. I didn't even know who she was but I was young and pretty much bought any CD. I am now almost18, and I still listen to her CD repeatedly. I know every word to every song. I noticed that someone reviewed her song " Another Dumb Blonde" with bad feedback. That person does not know music. Hoku's music is about love and how a girl can overcome a guy. Then she has a song about someone being there for her always, through thick and thin. "You Frist Believed" Is my all-time favorite. Its a touching song and reminded me of someone I know. If I had one last wish before I died, it would be to meet Hoku and her father, Don Ho. She is incredibly beautiful, and very talented. I have done kareoke many times, and most of which I was singing her songs. I am, without a doubt, Hoku's number1 fan!!!! I love you Hoku!!!!!Amanda
0	Hoku is a hit... with children five and under that is!: Hoku's ridicousily stupid "Another Dumb Blonde" is possibly one of the stupidest songs ever writen. Hoku didn't even write the song and the melody and lyrics are horid. Hoku is no small package thoiugh- she's two doughnuts away from 200. The title alone states perfectly what she is- another dumb blonde.
0	Another dumb blonde: Although she might say she's not,it's painfully obvious.Hoku is "another dumb blond". The only reason she gets those 5-star reviews is cuz people are so tired of dumb blond singers that they want to believe thet she's different.She danses like a moose.
1	Great CD!: Excellent music that carries a fantasic sense of Place. To my knowledge, Kyle Thompson is the only musician ever to record Civil War-era music ON LOCATION at different battlefields. Thompson is a talented musician and the fact that he had been diagnosed with Lou Gherig's disease by the time of the recording (something I found out after hearing the CD) just made it that much more poignant. The music on the CD is a balanced mix of lighter and darker music. The joy and humor come through in the upbeat songs while the tragedy and sadness of the War comes through the solemn pieces in a way that more glib, nauseously cheery musicians would never be able to communicate.
1	still the best: This album is awesome. I love the song Dive. This song kinda reminds me one of the songs that I used to sing in my church youth group. He always sings how a true christian (or should I say disciple) should feel. Especially in the song The Change. I saw him in concert in California. I was sixteen years old. The feeling that I had while I was at that concert was the best. I own all his albums. He never disapoints me. He is the main reason I listen to Christain music.
0	Building the Custom Home Office: This has to be the worst book I have ever seen on the subject.154 pages dealing with ONE home office layout/concept. AND this is from 2002. Very difficult to get ideas as it deals with one outdated office concept and explains how to build the components from scratch. In this day and age most components can be bought it is the ideas that are needed. Useless book. Don't know how it had over 4 stars when I bought it.
1	A cornerstone in brass-band funk: I first got this album in1992. I was immediately hooked. This album is a cornerstone of music that the dirty dozen brass band have helped bring back to the spotlight. One of my all time favorites.
1	Korean movie The Great Queen Seondeok: Great movie. Well directed and true historic account of the life of the Queen. Great action and plot. Not like some of those cheap Chinese movies.
0	the great queen seondeok: the story line is perfect the cast and choreogophy are great but the dvd's suck out of the first 20 chapters only 5 have had no problems and i lost have of the story line
1	Writers, You Need This Book: Whether you are a beginning writer or an established author, this book gives solid advice. I love how you can read the book from cover to cover or just flip to a section that you want to know about right now. Keep it handy and reference it often.Karen Reddick, author of Grammar Done Right!
0	their lesbian schtick is running thin: god, this music is soooo annoying! and didn't Britney already do the schoolgirl thing? they can only kiss each other while performing so many times before everyone gets tired of it.boring.
1	THE MOST ENJOYABLE ALBUM OF ALL TIME!!!!!!!!!!: This has to be one of the most amazing cd's ever! Britney Spears only wishes she could make music like this. Great pop beats with meaningful lyrics align all the songs here.Coming from someone who loves Madonna, Stevie Nicks, Michael Jackson. This is one of my favorite cd's of all time. I absolutley love each song to pieces.The album is very dark pop/electro, and it's enhoyable from start to finishMy favorite songs are How soon is Now, Stars, 30 minutes, and of course the classic Not Gonna Get Us, and All the Things she Said.BUY THIS ALBUM!!!!You have to listen to it! it's phenomenal!!
1	Tatu - Russian Music comes to the USA: Folks,For several years, the Russian music scene has exploded with a wealth of talent. Tatu is not the best Russian group, but they are pretty good, their music is very catchy. And...if you listen to the Russian versions, they're even more hypnotic.\According to people in Russia, Tatu is a kids band, a little 2nd rate, but what the heck, the songs are great, good melodies...I sing to them! My only problem is I heard them first as Russian songs, now they have been transformed into English!Perhaps someday the USA will be graced by even better artists, like Alsou Safina, someone who is a serious singer and can sing extrememly well.
1	These girls are definetely gonna get you!: Talk about amazing. These girls are definetely worth listening to. A couple months ago my friend talked me into downloading one of their songs. I caved in and did so. I listened to just a little clip of them, and I was immediately hooked. These girls have amazing voices, and you can definetely tell their heart and souls are in their music. I also think it's awesome that they are open about their sexuality. These girls aren't ashamed, and I believe that's awesome! These girls have awesome tracks like "All the things she said" a nice cover of "How soon is now", and one of my favs "Malchik Gay". If you feel like putting yourself in a good mood, and feel like dancing, then I definetely recommend this CD! Get them now, it's well worth it!
0	Not worth it - taped @ extended/super-long play & inaudible.: Inaudible particularly for Gollum's talking and some of the songs. Glitches appear in the taping including soem sections where the sound drops off for a second in the middle of a sentence. Not re-digitized. Not worth it. Perhaps other reviews refer to a different version of the movie.
0	didn't see it yet but not buying it: It is not fair to call this a "review" because I have not watched the DVD. Due to having seen several reviews here and on other websites regarding the lack of good audio and the sadly recrafted movie, I refuse to buy it. I LOVE The Hobbit from my childhood. I have been searching for months for the movie in DVD for my kids and after reading several reviews, I know myself well enough to choose to avoid the deep disappointment that others have related about this particular DVD. I just want the same movie I watched as a kid on a DVD. Is that too much to ask?
0	Great cartoon, horrible quality: This cartoon was one of my favorites when I was a kid. So now that I've got kids of my own I bought a DVD copy to watch with them. Unfortunately, the DVD is the worst analog to digital transfer I've ever seen. It has a very flat appearance, the colors are lifeless, not vivid like the original. They should fire the guy who made this DVD version. It looks like a cheap bootleg, maybe even worse. Don't buy this DVD until they re-release it with a proper analog to digital transfer. Also, I think they edited parts out of the original cartoon. I rarely ever rate anything on Amazon, but this is so bad I felt like I had to warn other people. If you've still got a VHS player, the VHS version of the film looks great.
0	over-whelmed with a sense of its own importance: seeing this film successfully kept me from reading anything by tolkien for over ten years. after i had read "the hobbit," i was able to watch it and laugh more often than i felt appaled.the film lacks the quiet dignity of the book and feels heavy-handed. watching it i could only think of the phrase, "bilbo gump." the progress the character of bilbo makes in the book is lost in film and we are left with a hero who wanders through his various adventures, which apparently have very little effect on anything aside from his financial situation. and as an extra side-note, the music feels ridiculous.
0	Missing sounds... how annoying: For the first time in my life, I wish I had a VHS copy even with the DVD released. I first noticed a problem when the first spider dies in the movie, and there is no vortex sound effect. Then the entire scene in Lake Town is... muted. The arrows are silenced, the dragon roars as a mouse, and the fire, it crackles as a loud annoyance. I wish I had read the reviews online prior to purchasing, now I am stuck with a poor quality DVD. I will be buying the VHS shortly.
0	The DVD sound is TOTALLY unacceptable: The DVD omits _all_ ambient noise in the movie, including Smaug's fire, his whooshing noise over the village, the arrows plinking, wolves howling, etc. It is very disturbing to those who are familiar with the video version, and if I could I would ask for my money back.
0	MOIVES ON PARADE! DO NOT ORDER-ITS WORST COPY OF HOBBIT: I have seen this moive over1000 times and thats no exageration! being born in1972 I remember this film in the theatres and has been a favorite ever since and is a FAMILY FAVORITE with my kids today.This "THE HOBBIT:THE ORIGINAL UNEDITED1977 ANIMATED CLASSIC" as advertised it a complete lie, the film is edited and missing scences,not whole scences mind but enough to make it seem it was chopped to be compadible for T.V. and its commercials to fit in a time slot, not only that the colar is quite faded and not sure if it is due to a poor quality DVD that the moive was downloaded/recorded on but there is a glich, a repeator skip of1.5 second as Bilbo spaeks to Gandalf and others....I will never order on Amazon again, HOW CAN THEY CALL IT THE ORIGINAL UNEDITED CLASSIC WHEN IT IS NOT!SAVE YOUR MONEY FOR THE REAL VERSION!!!
1	Great version of J.R.R. Tolkein's The Hobbit.: Bilbo Baggins ( voiced by " Orson Bean") is a Hobbit that goes on a simple quest with Gandolf ( John Huston) and a bunch of Dwarfs that must find Gold from the evil Dragon " Smaug". A highly entertaining and all-around fun yet excellent Rankin-Bassfilm which is one of the best they did with " Return of the King", " The Last Unicorn", and " Flight of Dragons".Also recommend: Lord of the Rings (1978), Return of the King,and Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Rings.
0	TERRIBLE DVD Sound - Avoid the DVD!!: Whether you like the original movie or not, the DVD version's soundtrack is missing a very large number of key elements - the majority of the sound effects, ambient sound backgrounds, some of the music, and even the occaisional bit of dialogue. The result is like watching an unfinished movie with a "temp" audio track. A truly horrendous offense for an animated movie, which depends so much on sound. Do NOT buy the DVD - you're not really getting the movie as advertised.
0	Disappointed...: What a bummer. First off, it was late getting here even though it was sent 2-day Prime. So it barely made it for Christmas. The worst part is the poor quality of the DVD. It skipped in SEVERAL places. Brand new out of the case, first time in the player, and it skipped. The quality of the movie is awful too. You'd think if it was that bad to begin with, it wouldn't have been transferred to a DVD to begin with... :/
1	A review- post viewing of the Hobbit: Overall, it was great. I, being a hardcore Tolkien fan, judged the movie with an extremely critical eye. The songs were well done. And the animation was o.k. It really only has one plot conflict,that being that they totally left out Beorn. Oh, yeah , the elves could have been portrayed better. They look like blue ants that got tangled up in the machinery of a textile mill. Gollum was wonderful.
0	Terrible DVD Transfer: My experience has been in line with several others here. Sounds are missing from the original version, some sounds repeat. There are several points where the DVD appears to skip and replay a short sequence that it just played. The colors are extremely poor -the cave scenes are supposed to be darker but here we struggled to actually see anything that was happening. I like the film, but the quality of this transfer is just unacceptable - do not buy.
0	Unwatchable!: The animated Hobbit has for years been one of my all time favorites. Unfortunately, the quality of this DVD is similar to what you would get if you copied a worn VHS tape onto a disk. The movie is so dark in many places you can only see dim shapes moving about. The theme song even has a skip in it and there are a number of other skips in the soundtrack. There are also several places where a second or so of the movie is duplicated and repeated. I have no idea how they messed that up! If i had purchased it locally, i would return it, but i guess i will keep it until they decide to fix this dvd and reissue it, hopefully on a blu-ray. My recommendation is Do Not Purchase this version unless you really cannot live without a copy, any copy.
1	Now thats what I call a bible: Fantastic - it arrived yesterday, 4000 miles to England in under 5 days from ordering - well done Amazon! When I opened it I thought "here at last is the bible I've been looking for for years"!
0	PRINT SIZE IS 6.2 NOT 9.5: I HAD TO RETURN MINE DUE TO INACCURATE DESCRIPTION6.2 IS UNREADABLE FOR ME
1	Perfect-sized Bible: I bought this Bible as a gift, and I was completely thrilled with it. It is small enough to carry with you but large enough for at home study. The print was larger than I expected, and the pages were not too thin. The cover work was very nicely done; my friend was very pleased with this Bible!
0	Caution before downloading: The Kindle Touch version has been problematic for me. I can find no Table of Contents, and no listing for the all important abbreviation needed for "this book." I appreciate that the download was free, now I know why. Discouraged.
0	Tiny Font: I bought the ESV single column legacy imitation leather Bible based on the stated font size of 9 points. When I received the Bible I could barely read the text even with reading glasses. I could not read the even smaller footnotes.I measured the capital letters and found them to be0.090 inch high. According to Wikipedia the current font standard is1 point =1/72 inch. That should make a 9 point font0.125 inch high. Even the old font standard has the 9 point font in the0.125 inch range.Other than the font the Bible seems to have good quality. Use of the very large margins should allow the publisher to use a full 9 point font without increasing the page count.The Bible was promptly returned.
1	Good, cheap Bible for travel: No footnotes or references, just your basic Bible. It's nice and small but still readable. Fits right in my purse. The only complaint I have is that I left it in my Jeep during the summer and the cover curled up pretty bad but not bad for the price.
1	Great for Gifts!: Super handy and looks legit, even though it's TruTone! And because it's less than $10, it makes great gifts! I've bought quite a few just to give away to my fellow church-goers!
0	Too long: The book is too long and contains some unnecessary kill-crazy parts. Certainly good for historical reference but I wouldn't reccomend this as a source of spiritual or even moral inspiration.
1	Yamaha ipod dock: Easy to connect, GUI display is clear and easily readable from a distance, and the remote of my Yamaha RX-V2700 is responsive. You can select the option to charge as well. You have to enable video output to see the video on another monitor.The only thing it DOES NOT seem to do, is to go the next level up from music i.e. video, photos (via the remote). You can manually watch video/photos (if you have those features on your ipod) by physically using the click-wheel and then you can stop/start the video with the remote. That last shortcoming prevents it from attaining a "5".
0	Still have not received it: I have not yet received this camera ordered at beginning of September, my emails to mike@nextpower.com are bounced back to me, and I cannot find a way to contact Amazon regarding this item...so I guess I am just out the money sent.
0	Could have been better.: I'm sorry to say I read about half of it until I gave up and skipped to the end and partially read the last chapter.I dont know what it was about the book that just didn't keep me hooked. Thankfully I got it from the library so it didn't cost me anything.Hopefully Sigaloff's next book will entertain me more.
0	This film had a point to make, but we lose interest right..: from the beginning. Because the film is so boring, we don't really care to know what the point was.ASH WEDNESDAY is about a middle-aged woman, who is undergoing a middle-age crisis, elememts of which include her having an extensive plastic surgery and a young lover. It is a "we have to value what we've got" sort of thing.Except for the great Henry Fonda, who appears only in couple of scenes, all actors are complete ham. I did not feel any genuine emotion coming from the screen, I didn't laugh, and I was not entertained. On my list, these are the characteristics of a bad movie. I am sorry to hurt the feelings of all die-hard Elizabeth Taylor fans: she is a true star, but even her costumes could not save this film. It is dull and pretentious!
1	Great Remote Mount Radio: This radio has the same features that most $300+ radios have, yet it's less than $100. The full channel scanning and DualWatch work great and to be such a compact unit with such a small speaker the audio sounds good. If you will be driving with the windows down go ahead and plan for an external speaker but for any other time the built in speaker works great. Once setup with a tuned antenna the transmit and receive are both great. A great radio for a great value!
1	Inspired movie!: I saw this movie on TBN channel last night and it was good. To the previous reviewer and anyone who is interested, you can get this movie in DVD format from World Wide Pictures homepage (http://shop.wwp.org). I'm going to order one from there today.
1	Can I give it10 STARS? Repin' HARLEM to the Fullest: This is a remarkable book. Mr.Thomas you did your thang! This is the first real grown- up book I read back in1995. I was sooo open I wanted to know everything that happened next. Piri was Wild! And knowing that this is an autobiography it's even more exciting. I love the way he represented the areas I've lived in or even went to school in. Piri told life how it really was and how it took him to learn about it. Growing up in Spanish Harlem put me on to a lot of Hispanics denying their African culture. It's true how some parents like Piri had act the same way as they did.I had the pleasure of meeting Piri Thomas at my school in Spanish Harlem also it was remarkable to picture such a character then really see him face to face although he was much much older. But it was still amazing. This book is Raw and it an absolute page turner let me tell you from a young Black teenager in Harlem THIS IS A VERY GOOD BOOK, AN ABSOLUTE PAGE TURNER!
0	Encounter With Alien Man: I would not recommend "Space Aliens Took Me To Their Planet" to those who disbelieve that the earth is being visited by spaceships (piloted by god-like people) because this book depicts such an encounter that took place in1973 in France. ======= The book's emphasis is upon the alien's extensive message concerning mankind's origins, mankind's religions, mankind's future, etc. ======= If I were to only judge the insights that this book provides into the awesome technology and power exhibited by aliens, a well as the awesome influence that aliens can wield upon human beings, I would have to give the highest rating available (five stars). However, I will only give this book one star because another book, entitled "The Sacred And The Profane", written by Desiree Ntolo (published in 2008 and available from Amazon.com), exposes the dangerously evil intentions that form the basis of the alien's message.
0	you gotta know when to fold em Kenny: Ugh! Kenny Rogers doing a Whitney Houston ballad? He doesn't have the voice for any of these songs. Stick to what you know Kenny.
0	Short Summary: These guys look like a couple of crackheads (especially the one on the left). Sad how they are being paid for this garbage. I guess a Jr. High School diploma and knowing your drugs gets you far in the ATL. Enjoy being rich and ignorant.
0	Breathtaking cinematography, invasive music,1 hour too long: One of the most beautifully filmed movies in recent years. The beauty of the images is about all there is to recommend here. The manipulative music is far too loud and sappy. Ethan Hawke is a robot. Scott Hicks commentary is one of the most boring on any DVD. Far too long, the only thing keeping your finger from the fast forward button are the images themselves.
0	Basically "To Kill A Mockingbird" With Different Ethnicity: Would have given it a1-star, but the production values were gorgeous (cinematography, music score, sound, set decoration.) However, very hard to follow with numerous flashbacks in flashbacks (I think.) I didn't read the book so I didn't know the story, but the author seems to have channeled another famous book. All the actors seemed put out to have shown up without any intrest in fleshing out their chracters, no chemistry inter-play with any of the characters. Slowwwwwwww..........
0	Impassioned Drudgery: This movie, though it tells a compelling story, it simply filled with drudgery. I have not read the book, and still may, but I also consider the story line to be absolutely full of a race-baiting mentality. I do not recommend "Snow Falling on Cedars."
0	nibbling on kelp: Snow falling on ceders has all the warmth and cheer of the wet, dismal, cold and foggy weather of the region. Utterly depressing.The plot is plodding and stale. No surprises.None of the characters can one identify or sympathise with. That every group is bigoted is nothing new.The ending not worth waiting for.Scenery is lovely as usual but the only redeeming feature of this film is that it portrays the region as it was that began dying out as I was born. The lumber industry and fishing are no longer what they once were. The ferry boats and strawberry fields are still there but tourism is now the biggy.
1	Blu ray please!: I really enjoy this movie, I haven't read the book, but the storyline in the movie is excellent. I would buy this on blu-ray in a heartbeat if it were to become available. My only fault with the movie is that (in my opinion) the "overdubbed voice-overs" (not sure exactly what you call them) toward the end seem a little overbearing.
0	A True Stinker: Cinematography is just ONE ingredient of a good film, not thewhole recipe. This was a story with so much promise, yet it insistedon becoming eye-candy rather than a good movie...... END
0	Great Work Of Fiction: Its a shame this book fails in its promise to expose a conspiracy but it makes for some good fiction. The author seems to feel that FDR was a communist and the reason he allowed Pearl Harbor to be attacked is to spread communisim around the world.I was left confused and bewilderd by Mr. Willey's arguments as most of the evidence presented was taken out of order or mixed and matched to fit his argument.
1	Celica 2002 GTS, no body kit: This fits pretty well, and doesn't stick out off the back very much at all. It does slightly press upwards on my bumper, this could be from a previous accident so I don't want to dock more than one star. Install is a little bit of a pain because of the angle to get the original brackets off, but I did it on my own in a parking lot. I use it to be able to take bikes with me, and still have some space for people/other stuff. I used this bike rack:Allen Deluxe 3-Bike Hitch Mount Rack (1.25 or 2-Inch Receiver)
1	Siberian Chipmunks: Basic Informative book on keeping siberian chipmunks as pets. My used copy was in great condition.Chipmunks
1	attention all TY collectors!!!!!: one of the best toys. low education, but a lot of fun! a best friend for hippity, floppity, and flippity!
1	fantastic!: I love the Cherry Poppin' Daddies...they're the best! Their songs are wonderful and they're sung beautifully.
0	Unable to return miss labled Stearns Rearm Kit: We have five SoSpenders inflatable PFDs model number 38APRO and ordered five rearming kits#0944 which state on the package that they fit the SoSpenders 38APRO PFD. The water sensitive bobbin in the kits does not fit the PFD and when we attempted to return the kits in the original packages to Amazon they would not accept them saying that they can not accept shipping of items that have gas in them. It is strange that they can ship to us items that have gas in it but we can not ship the same product in the original unopened package back to them. Now we are stuck with $120.00 worth of rearm kits that are of no use to us. Our recomendation is DO NOT USE AMAZON as they are a company that does not admit it has a miss labled or improperly packaged product.
1	Algebra: Structure and Method Book1 (California Edition): No marks that I have found yet. All pages seem to be there. Cover is good. In fact, it hardly looks used.
0	I'm happy my order was canceled: After reading several reviews, I ordered these, but they never arrived and I was reimbursed the purchase price, so I went to a local sporting goods store and compared these to theNikon10x42 Monarch. After comparing the two, even though the Monarch's were more money. The Monarch10x42 is a lot better quality Binocular. And I have been very happy with them .
1	GREAT MOVIE: I'm not sure why people have been giving this movie such low ratings. I highly recommend the DVD version. The artistic effects were absolutely brilliant! Although the story tends to drag on at times and the acting could have been better, I believe it is worth watching. I'd rent it before buying it.
0	Not True to History or Joan of Arc: Save your time and money - avoid this movie.I have studied the life of Joan of Arc and was extremely disappointed by this movie. The Messenger portrays Joan as a mental case who was unsure of herself and full of doubts. The record is clear that the real Joan was confident in her faith and in "her voices."Also the movie has many scenes of graphic violence that are purely gratuitous and unnecessary. Yes war is violent but to include scenes of a head exploded by a giant wreaking ball adds nothing.I do not recommend this movie to anyone who is serious about learning about Joan of Arc.Get the1948 Ingrid Bergman movie - it is much closer to the true story.For the best version of the real story, read Mark Twain's book.This movie is an insult to a young woman who is quite possibly the most remarkable person who ever lived (aside from Jesus).
0	Miscast: This movie was100% perfect, except Faye Dunaway should have caked some make-up on and played Joan of Arc herself. She has limitless talents and would have brought the movie what is was missing--a truly spiritual heroine. I'm telling you, Faye Dunaway was born to play this part. One can only hope of a re-make, and soon!
0	well.....it was okay: i ran into blockbuster excited to watch this movie. i am a big fan of joan and i like many others had big expectations for the movie. this movie was done the wrong way in many ways possible. who made the idea to have "joan of arc" the savior of the republic of france, to make her into a total lunatic? i know she had a minor case of epilepsy but she's not no EMILY ROSE. (in case you dont know emily rose she was a girl who was a epileptic that was so intence she was supposely possessed by demons.) how can u do such a thing? they made joan so annoying i didnt want to watch it no more. the action was not good at all. u could tell some of the cast of the movie were atheists because they made it look like those signs were not real. those signs were left by GOD and they were not by coincedence. dont bother pick it up and if you do, i doubt u will watch it again. this is the miami reviewer. PEACE.
1	Very historical: This movie combines aspects from the true story of Joan of Ark into a fighting fest and I love it. The battle scenes are nice and gore with blood coming from every part of those peoples bodys. But, it does try to tie history in it. Joan of Ark is potrayed to be a nice warrior. Millia Jovovich is a great actor. This movie got me very interested in Joan of Ark. This is one of my favorite movies ever!
0	The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc: Well as a student of History, this movie is to say the least, pittiful. The acting is so bad some of the fighting sequences are laughable. The young women who plays Joan, should go back to acting school, she only seems to have two levels crazy, and crazy screaming. The only good thing about the film were the sets and costumes.
0	Great music, Bad recording: This session was recorded in Ohio in1980. I don't know what kind of recording equipment was used, but the sound is terrible!
1	Fantastic Book: A wonderfully written book. A superb plot. Great characters. Interesting setting. A classic. A must read. One of my10 favorite works of fiction. Maybe even better than Shogun!
0	Never got the book and it's been a month...: I ordered this book for a friend's son's birthday. I have tried to find out why they haven't gotten it and they say it is still in transit... I can't get a straight answer from anybody.
1	My kids love to read this over and over: I have 3 boys, all of them love learning about bugs. It's perfect for my oldest (who doesn't like to be near bugs, but loves learning about them). It's also perfect for my middle and youngest boys, who pick up every and any bugs they can get their hands on. I am so happy we purchased this book (we did a few Christmases ago), and they still love reading it. There are a few every-day bugs in the book, and a lot of exotic and poisonous bugs, which seems to interest my kiddos even more. It's full of large, very detailed photos of each bug that's described. Awesome.
0	not as good as i was hoping: when i considered buying this for my car and started looking at the reviews i knew it was going to be a toss up wether it was going to be a quality product or not, i liked that it had the front firing speaker and the soundtracker system, which the radio i have in my tractor for work(cobra25) also has the soundtracker system and it works great, but when i recieved it and set it up with a 2ft wilson antenna its performance was less then exceptional, radio is very noisy even with the soundtracker system on. this radio constantly freezes(when i turn it on it will be stuck on ch9 and you wont be able to change channels use the weatherband or anything, you have to turn it off and hope for the best next time you turn it on) and the front firing speaker is very quiet. i should have went with another cobra25 and just bought an external speaker
1	Mac cover: I bought this for my buddy. He had looked at one, and he loves it now that he has it! Stylish and functional, what else could you want?
1	Gripping account of long-lasting effects of killing spree.: Author Greg Kelly was10 years old growing up in Rockford, Ill., when Ray Lee Stewart went on a weeklong killing spree that took 6 lives and shook the community's small-town midwestern roots. Like so many others in Rockford, Greg was terrified until long after Stewart's capture and haunted by his crimes for years afterwards. Fifteen years later as a young newsman working at WGN Television in Chicago, Greg called in sick so he could attend the murderer's clemency hearing. A few weeks later he witnessed the execution. Kelly's vivid description of that eerie evening is alone worth the price of the book, as are the insights into courtroom proceedings, TV reporting, and Kelly's portraits of victims' families and their suffering.
1	The kids loved it!: Stuart Little is one of those nice films that you can drag out on a rainy winters' day, and the kids will watch it despite having seen it lots of times before. The blu-ray quality is very good, and there is nothing in this film which will disturb young children - mine are 5 and 8 and they both enjoy it. Recommended!
0	Charlotte's Web is better! OH MY SWEET TEMPLETON!: CHARLOTTE'S WEB IS BETTER BECAUSE THE MOVIE HAD TEMPLETON IN IT. (TEMPLETON IS MY BOYFRIEND)! SO.. I WANT EVERYONE TO KNOW: "RATS ARE BETTER THAN MICE!" STUART LITTLE IS FOR PEOPLE WHO DON'T FALL IN LOVE WITH THE RAT ON CHARLOTTE'S WEB! IF YOU THINK MY REVIEW IS HELPFUL, E-MAIL ME AT SweetRoxanne@hotmail.com IF YOU THINK IT'S NOT HELPFUL, E-MAIL ME AT Roxanne12@aol.com
1	Adoption message: This is a fun, wholesome movie. It also provides a starting point for discussing adoption with children. Even if children aren't adopted, they will certainly meet others who are. This movie presents adoption in a positive light, an attitude which I believe even young children can begin to emulate.
1	A Sure-Favorite At the Day Care!!: This is one of the Most Requested movies at our Day Care Center and certainly one of my personal favorites!! Everybody in the movie is wonderful....Mr. and Mrs. Little (Geena Davis is really great!!), big brother George, SnowBell, the impostor Mom & Dad Mouse Family, everybody is great, just I really can't stand Stuart that much!! GASP!! Maybe it is just that he is so naive. He jus thinks everybody loves him. Or maybe it is just that he is so stupid as to think that the Little's were so glad to get rid of him they cut his picture out and he believes SnowBell. I know, I know, that is the WHOLE POINT OF THE STORY, but it bothers me a little. So I give 'Stuart Little' 4 Stars, and well, maybe 4 and a Half.
0	suartlittle: they don't talk about funny stuffsthey don't pretend to be dead.They don't go fast with a car.Can't put them to a jail.Can't have a hot rideCan't go full blast with a car
0	not necessarily for kids: My two young children enjoyed watching this movie, but I was very disappointed when I heard the cats swearing. I don't want my children to pick up and mimic that language, thinking that it's cute and fun because it is from this movie. The mice and cats are very cute and well done, but the cursing didn't add anything to what should have been a family show. For cute animals, there are better movies to watch.
0	Too bad no one read the book: This movie called Stuart Little because its title character is a mouse, not because it has anything to do with E.B White's book of the same name. I felt like I was watching a re-telling of "Annie" rather than seeing a film version of a great story. A typical result of creating a giant marketing and merchandising machine.
1	A somewhat entertaining historical account: Given my odd sense of humor, I wasn't suprised that I liked this book. While tragic, the deaths accounted for remind us that when we're dealing with nature, we must deal with it on its own rules. The "pedestrians have the right-of-way" attitude won't cut it out there, folks! Of course some deaths were not the result of the individuals foolishness, but also by accident or bad luck.
0	George b: I see this highly rated and don't understand how that can be, unless screen visibility is of no concern to those reviewers. Look before you buy this one!I'd never recommend this 2610 because of the single issue that the display is unusable in daylight & barely marginal for inside viewing. It's a shame because the sound is good. Maybe that's why AT&T; gives them away free - hoping to get rid of them.
0	Not very good: I'm not a huge fan of Medieval literature, and perhaps this book is to blame. I think I've been spoiled by the Norton and Bevington anthologies I've used in other classes, because this was truly a let-down. If you're a prof looking for a good book to use for class, have your students spend the extra twenty-spot and get a Norton.
1	good: I am very satisfied with the product, it came in a good time and the customer service provided was great.
0	dated...: 'Cheap and cheerful' is how I'd describe this book. Which means there are better, and more up to date, ideas around on how you can manage time and life. I found the ideas dated and the author's style prescriptive.Much better value, highly practical, and with some innovative ideas, is Mark Forster's Get Everything Done (And Still Have Time To Play).
0	okay, but derivative: Lots of interesting examples but too many of them seem to come from a right-wing perspective. Also the book, which is humorless, reminds me of other better-done accounts of the same areas. The lessons of the book should be applied to the book itself. It doesn't fare well if this is done.
0	Complete Waste of time / Film: The premise seemed alluring... saving the world in secret by use of time travel to the future... But nothing makes much sense in this movie. all of The charactors can't think past their nose. What drives them on? oh yeah their unknown B actors getting paid to play in a truly pathectic Sci-Fi... Like most reviewers I tend not to write about somthing that really just sucks, but I had to this time cause this one pissed me off so. I've seen many B-movie Sci-fi's but this one takes the cake. Of all the movies waiting to be transfered to DVD what Exec. Booted this one into production? Must be another groopie friend of Peter Fonda. I thought with Fonda's name attached to it, it couldn't be half bad. But was I wrong!
1	Everything is better with Jello!: Good to hear that there is someone out there that's popular in the clubs......but maintains a message and logic. Unfortuanatly I'm sure most of the fans don't have a clue as to what half there songs are about. Not unlike Dead Prez, Skinny Puppy, Antipop Consortium, Jeru Da Damaja, KRS-ONE etc. Everybody just wants to dance and be......entertained as the world around them falls apart.Anyhow, rants aside this is a very this album, it has a very Motown kind of sound to it though I'm sure that is just synths and not actual instruments.Regardless the M.C. is good, the words hard hittting, and like I say, Jello Biafra from the Dead Kennedys is on it, you can't go wrong!
0	Bad Book!!!: This book was bad..... in organization, setup, explanation, and examples.... If you want a good java book, LEWIS and LOFTUS is great. I regretfully have to buy BIG JAVA another Horstman great for a class. I sure hope its better than this one!
1	Remember children, it's only the concepts.: Calm down, calm down. The title of this book has neither '..in a week', nor '..in 24 hours and certainly not '..while you drive to work' in its title.It teaches you the 'concepts' and 'essentials' of Java programming. It doesn't cover IO in detail nor threads, nor games programming. When you've finished this book then you will be ready to tackle those difficult topics that are well covered by Reilly's animal series. The main theme running through the book is the progressive development of an interactive bank account. I can recommed this book to absolute beginners or those not familiar with object orientated programming.Bonus points go to the first half of the book. Minus points go to coverage of IO.
0	barely useful: Flimsy construction, indoor display is hard to read at most angles, and the remote unit only has a temperature sensor--no hygrometer, which wasn't clear from the product description.
0	Could have been better: I bought this book for the unique spreads and read it thoroughly. I would have liked to see explanations for why the cards are laid out in certain order and places. I thought the questions were too specific and would be difficult to answer with numerous cards. Interesting spreads, good subject matter, not well executed or explained at all. Please rewrite the book, Ms. Abraham and I will buy it again.
1	Great product. UI could be improved: I've had this product for at least six years. I love the functionality. We receive a good number of thunderstorms in our area so the audible alert can be a hassle. But the fact I can set it to only alert visually is great. We have a vacation home so I add the county number for that location when we are there. Most of those alerts are snow related and it really saved me once because we don't receive local stations there and a big snowstorm popped up out of the bright blue sky.I originally gave it five stars but knocked it down because of the user interface. I'm a techie and I can pick up an object I have not touched in a while and operate it. However, I always forget how to add a county number and it takes me a few minutes to figure it out. Maybe they have already improved it since mine is so old.
1	Great radio! Nearly invisible instructions!: The OS WR102 is a terrific radio, especially considering the price here on Amazon. It is essential to have a reliable weather radio since mid-Mississippi is subject to killer tornadoes and fearsome thunderstorms. I will certainly feel safer with this one close by.My only complaint: the instruction sheet is printed in a typeface so small I had to enlarge it on a copy machine in order to read it. While the instructions are clear, the layout is sensible, and the programming relatively simple, trying to decipher 4-point type made the whole experience needlessly frustrating. C'mon, guys! Your radio is a really good one! Why diminish a fine product with nearly invisible -- and thereby unreadable -- instructions!?
0	Disapointed: I was never really able to get this unit working. After thinking I had installed weak batteries, I discovered that the only way to keep the unit powered was to apply pressure to the battery cover compartment. Additionally, I found installing batteries annoying due to a very thin peice of weather stripping that easily falls out of place and is not amenable to being replaced. I returned this item.
0	Sealy Best Fit 330-Thread Count Cotton Sateen Sheet Set: Purchased this set of sheets on April16, 2011, only two months ago. The fitted sheet have started piling, which indicates not a good quality set of sheets. The only thing that I loved about these sheets is the fitted sheet and how it hugs the mattress. For the price of these sheets the quality is just not there. The sheets that these replace were 5 years old and just started ripping, two months is unacceptable.Sincerely,Jody M Becnel
0	OUCH!: First of all I must agree that these are the best fitting sheets you may ever find in your life. BUT, unless you love sleeping on the beach with nothing between you and clumpy, gritty sand, don't buy them. After several washings the fabric is truly so rough that it hurts. There is a fatal flaw- the fabric- and the manufacturer must change it if it wants repeat customers. Summary: fit is fantastic, sheets are terrible. Don't buy them.
0	Like the idea behind the phone but not this one: this is my second cordless phone with a headset-this one I can not hear out of. I contacted the seller Rainbow Barter and they said all sales were final. So I tried to contact IBM sat on the phone 25 minutes the first time on hold, was disconnected and I am sitting again 25 minutes. maybe this time I will get luck :(
0	Broken Bottle: Ordered this set for my grandma, it showed up 3 days before christmas and the main perfume bottle was cracked and had leaked every where.Wouldnt recommend buying from the seller, should have just went to jcpenny in the first place.
0	Chiefs: I got a VHScopy that did not work on my video player.I was able to return to the sender.I would have liked to get the new DVD copy but found it too costly.It was a good tv series and book and Isaw it quite a long time ago.It's to bad that the cost is high.Ron
0	Vague advice: I bought this book just before marrying a man with four children from his first marriage. I expected solid examples of stepmoms overcoming obstacles and sharing their wisdom. However, I found the book very frustrating:1)the testimonials all came from women who were dissatisfied with their relationships, neglecting those who developed strong bonds with stepchildren; 2)the advice is all too vague to be applied. Chapters titled, "Simplify Expectations" and "Simplify Relationships" are filled with generalizations that are about as effective as telling an over-stressed mom to "just relax". Overall, a disappointing read.
0	A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court: I thought that A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court By Mark Twain touched a lot of important aspects that our culture and society faces today while also satirized the times of Camelot. It also contrasted and showed the differences between the medieval times and the nineteenth century.But unfortunately I found this book hard to follow and had trouble getting into it. I felt that Twain often drug on certain topics or ideas. I think that I would have found this book to be a lot more interesting if Twain would have been more forward and to the point. I guess this book just wasn't for me, but others might find it interesting.But I do have a lot of respect for Twain for writing this. I'm sure that this book caused a lot of controversy since he wrote about a lot of sensitive topics, especially earlier in his time.
1	A Great Satire in the form of a Great work of Literature: Mark Twain is no Science-Fiction author, but he makes this a good story anyway. He sends a mechanical genius back to the time of King Arthur to take a look back at America. Because of his knowledge, the narrarator becomes the King's right-hand man, the second most powerful man in England, known as The Boss. He begins to establish a more advanced society underground to gaurd against the Church. Over many years, he learns to adjust to the society and becomes respected world-wide due to his "magic." Unforetunately this results in making Merlin his great advisary. The Boss goes on many adventures and gets involved in many predicaments, each time surviving by his wit and knowledge. A wonderfully told tale that examines America's faults by looking at them from 7 centuries before. Unfortunately Twain, once again, falls short on his ending and leaves the reader mildly entertained, but not better off.
0	I didn't really like the book it was boring, the end=best.: It was grat at some parts and boring at others. The end made up for alot of the book.
0	very different book: i think that this book was very diffent. and that it was very hard to understand. most of the book i wasnt really sure what was going on just that he was magical and that he was in the past. there was definitly a twisted ending but thats ok. if i had a choice i probably wouldnt have read this book and read a different book on the list but oh well i got the pages i needed out of it.

1	A Clear Differentiation of the Three Codes: Among the many works of Tibetan masters devoted to the three codes, none has enjoyed more notoriety than A Clear Differentiation of the Three Codes by the celebrated author Saskya Pandita Kunga Gyaltshen (or Sapan,1182-1251), presented here in a Western translation for the first time. Not so much a text on the content of the codes themselves as an examination of the many particular questions that relate to the codes - questions that Sapan saw as subject to misunderstanding on the part of his Tibetan contemporaries - The Three Codes has a strongly polemical character. Thus it is easy to see why some readers found the work objectionable in places, others praised it, and all have become fascinated by it. Few indigenous Tibetan writings have inspired so abundant and diverse a body of later-commentary, commentary that rivals even that on the great Indian Buddhust treatises in its extent.
0	What a disappointment.: My son's two favorite things in the world:1. Little Einsteins, 2. Space. He went crazy when he saw the commercial for this new DVD. We, too, pre-ordered the movie and counted down the days until its release. And we, too, were bitterly disappointed by its contents. As the other reviewers have said, it is not a movie, and it is not about space. I would think that if Disney were going to release a space-themed DVD containing old episodes, they would at least include Galactic Goodnight. At least that one actually talked about the planets. I would not have purchased this if I would have been able to preview it before buying. :(
0	Need something to light a fire? Here you go...: I gave this one star, because negative stars are not allowed. The previous review has to have been written by someone closely related to the book.I was a teen-ager during the '80s Ninja Craze and even then, this book would have been seen as a complete joke. I think I was expecting a Mutant Ninja Turtles cartoon to turn up somewhere in the book, but was disappointed to not see one.Bottom-line - Stay away from this book. If you are really interested in something about ninja, look into Stephen K. Hayes.
1	A+: item came on time in excellent condition great service hope I can do business with this seller again highly recommended!
1	As expected: I got this for my child and he loves it. Order flowed as expected, easy as pie. Comics are still a great gift.
1	This guy was evil: This book shows you that Bob was a womanizer, but Bob was way worse than what this book says. Check out another book about Bob Hope called "Thanks For The Memories" by Brice Taylor. Yep, Bob and Michael Jackson had something in common, only Bob had underaged girls not boys.
1	good for the tackle box: I got this as a gift for my10 year old nephew who loves to go fishing. He needed some help getting the hooks out of the fish and this works great with his little hands. It fits nicely in his tackle box and the wood grain makes it look really nice. I am sure he will out grow it or end up dropping it in the lake but for the price i can afford to buy him another one later.
0	thank you: This one gift I could give my grown daughter. I read this book over and over to her as a child. It was in wonderful condition!
0	One Star, and it goes to JLH and the Stiller's: The characters with the smallest amount of screen time, played by Jennifer Love Hewitt, Ben Stiller and his real life dad, Jerry Stiller, are the only ones worth watching for in this sad little effort. The story is a mishmash and not at all interesting, but hey, Ms Hewitt does look great, so if you're into that I can recommend it. One thing I do want to point out, however, is that there is no commentary track on the DVD, contrary to what the specs show.
0	Somebody shoot me.................please: Jennifer Love Hewitt is the only bright spot in this mind dulling dribble. The script leaves you not caring for the characters. I can't say the words to descibe this movie. There is maybe one or two semi funny scenes in the whole 90 min of boredom. If you like daydreaming buy this DVD, because you'll be so bored your mind will be wandering in thousands of directions.
0	Worst book from Whitman ever: The black and white photo's look like photocopies of photocopies.And to add insult to everyone, the book is printed in CHINA...Whitman has sunk to a new low on this one.Buy any other book other than this one if you really want to use it.The poorest book that Whitman has ever offered, lets hope it's not theirstandard for the future.
1	My nephew loved this!: I gave it all 5 stars just because my nephew loved it so much. He is very hard to please at 9 yrs old and this was something he really enjoyed. He likes hands on things and race cars so there you go.
1	This is a Great Product!: I bought this having read some bad reviews about it but you get what you pay for! But I was actually blown away by it, the picture quality is wonderful, the sound is good unless it's noisy, though what I did was used some mini speakers you can buy for discmans they work great to add extra volume. The battery does last about three hours but it does come with an a/c adapter and car adapter which is nice. I also liked the fact that it came with a cord(don't know what it's called) but I was able to plug it into my home theater system for surround sound and also into my tv for larger picture. I also rent a lot of dvd's and all of the rentals worked fine for me, if your having trouble with a disc just clean it, I use soap and water although I hear that's a big no no but it's works great! Overall it is a awesome system for the money!
0	it stings: picture is very bad sound not that good eather lacks lots of inportent features havey and bulkey almost like a notebook feels vary clumsey in your hand whorse of all whit slith tuceh dics door will open while playing
0	Terrible Nickel Allergy triggered by strap connectors/adjusters: The strap loops and strap adjusters triggered a severe nickel allergy on my back where they touch the skin. There should be a warning on the tag but there isn't. If you have a Nickel allergy do not buy this. In most bras these connectors and adjusters are covered with or use plastic. This is bare metal and contains enough Nickel for an almost instant breakout.
0	Product is cheaply made, Customer Service was terrible from Elmosworld: I purchased 2 of these items, on one of them, the LCD display does not work perfectly (the0 as a part of12:00 pm is missing a line of the0 on the display- see my submitted pictures) but this is no big deal- the item still works OK.The other product arrived damaged since it has a battery compartment door that is made of cheap plastic at the bottom of the unit and UPS damaged it during shipping.It took me filing a complaint with Amazon just to get a response from this company, and the situation is still not resolved, they have not offered to send me a free return label to send it back to them.I will never order from Elmosworld again. Terrible customer service.
0	Genuine Chinese Crap: This radio is insanely over-priced. You can get worse, but you can't pay more for it.The Oregon Scientific WR-8000 is a true piece of crap. Do not purchase it.I bought mine brand new in the box for two dollars at a church yard sale. Boy am I glad I didn't pay more for it.The Oregon Scientific WR-8000 is cheaply constructed all the way around. Everything about this shoddy radio is cheap cheap cheap. Want poor reception? You got it! Want brittle plastic that breaks easily? You got it! Want a compass that doesn't work? You got that too!Be prepared to do quite a bit of research to find an emergency radio worth owning. If it says "Made in China" avoid it if you can. If China does make anything worth owning they certainly don't export it to the USA."Oregon Scientific" is another term for cheap piece of Chinese crap.You will regret it if you buy this radio.Caveat emptor.
1	I agree: I agree with the review from August 8, 2000 in that Mary Anne needs to move on and it wouldbe cool to have her do something else. However, I did really enjoy the book. I thought When Mary Anne helped Sunny it showed more of her personality from the old series, and I liked that Mary Anne more. I thought it was funny how active Sunny was.
0	LOUSY PHONE: Good Price with a nice package, but very poor quality sound. We purchased 2 of these phones...both had echo, and low sound quality. We could not even have a conversation with the other party. Both are being returned!!
1	Great CD: This CD contains nearly all of Peter Gabriel's through the album "So" in1986. Go through the track list, and you will likely find more than a few you've heard on the radio. A glaring ommission is Gabriels' most famous (and possibly best) song "In Your Eyes". Although you will find that at least a quarter of the sixteen tracks on this CD come from "So", that song is missing from this collection. For that reason, I knock a point off this "best of" collection.
1	Just what I wanted: I was looking for a good walking sandal that could be adjusted in case my feet were swollen (as often happens after flying). These were comfortable right away, the size was good, wore them every day and they were always comfortable, no blisters forming. Very happy with them, and would purchase other Propet products.
0	poor quality: Item is very heavy and does not hold a charge well. illumination begns to dim almost immediately and is never very bright. I would not purchase this item again.
0	Poor light - Looses charge fast: I have been purchasing a few of these self charging flashlights lately to find the best one.This one puts out a a poor amount of light. It also does not retain its charge well. You will have to shake it frequently to keep it charged.I would say it is one of the worst ones I purchased.
0	Flashlight: Don't ever buy this. It is a rip off and a gimmick. Your hands will get tired really fast for shaking the flashlight and 30 seconds of shaking will not even get you 5 minutes of light with consistent brightness. Even more the light dims almost instantly after shaking with no retention of charge whatsoever. Other flashlights that require cranking can give up to 2 hours of light for1 minute of cranking if you get the right one.
0	Reed switch doesn't work, the flashlight is inoperable.: I am helping my son with an electromagnetic induction science fair project and have studied extensively the requirements for these types of flashlights to operate. This flashlight is better than the 'fake' shake flashlight we'd previously ordered for $2.35 at amazon.com, because it actually uses a real NIB magnet and appropriate circuitry. However, the reed switch (which uses a small magnet to connect the capacitor's stored potential to the LED)doesn't work. Thus, the LED won't light. I'm very disappointed with this purchase. There are genuienly amazing shake flashlights that, both in function and design are truly brilliant devices, but they cost a lot more than this flashlight, so it seems that the old saying, "you get what you pay for", is proven true, once again.
0	Not Louie Anderson's finest hour...: I remember going to see this at the theater in1988 when I was fourteen. Besides my dad and me, there were only two other people in the theater. They stood up and left halfway through. There was a good reason for this. This movie is very poor and I believe it only stayed in theaters for about a week before tanking. Good for nostalgia value only.
0	Not Recommended: I am very disappointed with this phone. I have to press the talk button several times to get a dial tone, and then when I do get a dial tone and make a call, I have a very hard time hearing the person on the other end of the line. The caller id feature does not work, and I know it isn't my phone company because our other CID displays work fine. It always just flashes "Ringing" on the display when the phone rings. I have owned this phone for 6 months now, and I am planning to replace it very soon.
1	Better than expected: I don't really expect a lot from Voyager novels. Fact is, I rarely buy them unless they're part of a series like this one. So, I found myself pleasantly surprised by this one. Carey doesn't rely as much on the bar to jar the reader in and out of the story and it's stronger for that. She gives Janeway her own unique voice and makes reading the book a pure pleasure. My only gripe is that Carey's love of sailing shows through far too many times and is getting a bit tedious since it's been the focus of her past several Trek yarns. But otherwise, an enjoyably pleasant book.
0	Let's replace plot and acting with profuse profanity and see if they can tell the difference...: This movie is just plain bad.Don't get me wrong. I wanted to like it. Having come off watching American Zombie, which also sucked, I was hoping for some needed zombie respite. Not happening here.What dialogue and acting there is seems forced and badly delivered. Frankly most lines and acting seemed like they belonged in a bad porno rather than a good zombie movie (neither of which is this movie).It seems like whenever there was a lack of dialogue for a scene, it was simply replaced with profanity of all sorts.I ended up turning this movie off half way through it, which I very rarely do. I felt the movie bored me, offered nothing and basically wasted my time and money.If you want a "good" zombie movie, I don't think this is it. SeeDawn of the Dead,Zombieland,Fido,Shaun of the Dead,Resident Evil,Dead Snow. Pretty much anything other than this movie.
0	Original thought: This movie had an original idea, but lact so much for being a zombie movie. At times it was just stupid! Another zombie movie id pass on. Doubt I'll be re-watching this movie any time soon!
0	Low Quality Packing tape: I pack and ship items on a daily basis. I bought this tape to seal my packages. It was cheap (so yay for price), but extremely low quality. It will not adequately seal a cardboard mailer without many layers. Even then, I worry that the package will open in transit.Lesson learned. Next time I will pay more for a higher quality product.
0	Bad!!I false advertiser!: I have to give them a negative-10! the add clearly says a 6pack so I ordered 5 sixpacs and the only sent me 5 rolls! Clearly false advertising! I even orderd some for my sister! What a rip off! Don't order from them!!!!!!!!!!!!Plus the shipping of $8 that is a RIP OFF!!!!!Scotch Sealing Tape,1.88 x 54.6 Yards, Clear, 6 Pack (3690)
0	sent wrong speaker: Speaker they sent was a cheap imatation. A real letdown from amazon. They should change the picture.
1	there's nothing better than live rolling stones: i own three rolling stones albums now, but there's nothing like listening to them live on cd. there are two new studio tracks on the cd. at first, i thought they had covered "sex drive" by twisted sister and w.a.s.p., but a closer listen brung up different lyrics.
1	Stones live with a full band: Many people prefer the Stones as just the 5 playing live, but I also like when they brought on this large troupe along for the shows, more backup singes, brass section and 2 keyboards. The Stones are much more controlled and played very well and together. What you dont get is the raw energy of a rock concert as you would find on their1981 "Still Life" album, but I find this album most enjoyable. My only gripe is they left off "Gimme Shelter" which they did an incredible job at and threw in 2 lousy studio redcordings to get a hit single out of for bigger sales."High Wire" is a good song, the 2nd studio song "Sex Drive" is a joke and should have stayed in the vaults, complete waste to add that trash song to this magnificient live Stones album.You can get the accompanying DVD "Live at the Max" and se it for yourself.
1	Awsome.: I dont know what the lower guys issues with his connection are, I have0 issues with ping, mine is always in the130 range. Maybe you should stop DLing porn while playing multiplayer games.This is a great game, very fast paced and enjoyable. You can choose to enter any type of vehicle, while being more arcade than simulation, the action and craziness are well worth the low price offered by EA games...
1	G'Day! G'Day!: Great selection of songs, Mate. Disapointed that "Tie Me Kangaroo Down, Sport" was only instrumental. Other wise very happy.
1	Great: Really good ! All the classic Aussie songs, including Waltzing Matilda,Botany Bay and Tie Me Kangroo Down...you don't want to miss this one.
0	bling bling: man, this album is phat. the title track, "F the BS", and "Buttermilk Bisquick", have more sweet raps than all of p-diddy's albums put together. mix-a-lot has been dropping tricked-out heat rocks longer than anyone in the biz, and it shows on this record. he has elevated himself to the level of Abraham Lincoln, Ghandi, and Hitler with his pure genius. nothing on earth has ever touched me in such a way as this sweet album. ever since i picked up the12" lp ... i have been a better person. rap on, mixy, rap on, and let those B.G.'s eat your dust, you loc-ed out O.G.holla
1	Excellent service!!!: I received my shipment of this Blu-ray disc in excellent condition and in record delivery time. Thanks!
1	Review by a music lover: If you love rock and roll music and you appreciate it's history, you will love this movie. Great sound, great music, great performances and solid acting. This movie confirms in my mind who the ultimate father of rock and roll really is and how the Rolling Stones came up with the name for their band. Very interesting.
1	Changing from a 20th Century status and power driven environment to a 21st continuous learning and collaborative environment: After Image is much more than a marketing and branding education. Grant communicates very powerfully the change in structure and thinking that is necessary for individuals and for us as whole to succeed in the 21st Century. His explaination of moving from a work/status ethic to a continuous learning/collaborative/networking ethic provides a structure for individuals, organizations and countries to base their readiness for the real work of the 21st Century.
1	Oh, yeah! The "Coriolanus effect"!: This one isn't really "science fiction," since, with only changes, it could be set in the here-and-now, or in Ruritania -- but it's pure Heinlein, and better written than many of his earlier works. At only128 pages, it's also pretty short for a novel -- but it works. Lorenzo Smyth (a/k/a Larry Smith) is an actor convinced of his own talent (which, as it turns out, is actually considerable) who is hired to impersonate the Good Guy leader of a major political alliance, who has been kidnaped on Mars by the Evil Opposition. Against his better apolitical judgment, Lorenzo takes the job because it's a challenge, and almost immediately regrets it as the limited engagement spins itself out indefinitely. There's a minimum of strident overwriting of the sort Heinlein was often guilty of in pursuit of his moral and ethical positions, with the quietly-made exception of a plea for racial tolerance.
0	Lousy 802.11 reception & transmission.: I'm using this on a Win98SE PC to connect to an Apple AirPort Base Station. It sees the base station fine, but when the Belkin is touching the base station it transmits at 70% signal strength. My PowerBook can see the base station at100% one floor up, 80% on the second floor up.Belkin software was easy to use and configure. Maybe my HP Pavilion causes a lot of RF interference? Unknown, but I'd try a Linksys or Hawking over the Blekin. Don't be swayed by the price.
0	Does not work with XP: After spending several weekends installing & re-installing this product on my XP Pro box, to use with its sister product (Belkin F5D6130 AP), I GAVE UP. Included CD was flakey -- so, got new driver from Belkin website. Installed & worked -- until I rebooted, then XP froze up. Had to disable an XP service (SSDP Discovery). After reboot, USB device is recognized, but offline, and cannot bring online. I have extensive experience with networking (20 years). Tech support was of no help. Could be an XP problem, but note: Belkin Driver is "unsigned". Avoid this product (for XP) until Belkin releases a better XP driver. Going forward, I will be looking for a wireless Ethernet bridge, possibly LinkSys WET11.
0	How Could You Do This?!?: AAAGGGGHHHHHHH! That's the sound of millions of Anne of Green Gables fans screaming in collective disgust. Not only is this last Anne movie bad. It's HORRIFYINGLY bad! I am a strongly against capital punishment but this movie has given me pause. I can't believe the Canadian government didn't put the movies producer in front of a firing squad for the way he thoroughly trashed the wonderful stories of Anne, Gilbert and the gang (not to mention trashing the hopes of millions of Anne fans). How a movie producer could miss so badly after hitting two grand slams is totally beyond my comprehension. Why did he depart from the books and make up a totally different story? The first two Anne of Green Gables movies were beautifully done. This one gives censorship a good name.
0	The worst movie ever: My family and I love Anne of Green Gables and cried through most of it.. we do not have a problem with the first 2... but............ we have been watching the series1.30 each week and come to the last dvd the coninuing story and boy is is the worst acted and story movie we have ever seen... I do not know what happen to Anne ( megan fellows) she was dead in every which way you look at it, no sparkal, no love no joy or happeness in her eyes or face at any time, she acted like a 50 year old women, we know she grew up but a person who has sparkle and joy and laughter in their eyes never loses that, and her voice in a few years has become deep and old.. we are so disappointed and so upset with this dvd... how can ones acting and joy be gone so fast... help
0	A Stain on Lucy Maude Montgomery: This final installment of an otherwise brilliant trilogy on the Anne of Green Gables story is beyond horrific. It is a stain on the memory of Lucy Maude Montgomery.
0	unimaginably bad: I bought this despite the bad reviews because I thought it was impossible for an Anne movie to be that bad, but they managed to pull it off. Not only do they burn down Green Gables but they create chemistry between Anne and another man while things with Anne and Gil are cold. Come on people...all we want is a good chick flick with a nice ending!!
0	Disappointing: I absolutely loved the first two Anne movies. When I heard they were finally making another movie, I was very excited to see it. I was extremely disappointed that the movie thoroughly strayed from L.M. Montgomery's enchanting story line. The story line was nothing like the true story of Anne, and although some may think it is a good movie in its own way, it is not worthy to carry the name Anne of Green Gables. The plot of this movie held no interest for me, and was extremely disappointing.
0	Disappointing: This is the third installment in a series of dramatizations of Lucy Maud Montgomery's beloved Anne of Green Gables novels. Megan Follows and Jonathon Crombie return in their usual roles. Unfortunately, this third production does not meet the high standards set by the first, faithful installment. In a total of seven Anne novels, Montgomery provided fully enough amusing, sentimental, and unabashedly romantic material for three movies. It was a pity that the second production (Anne of Green Gables: The Sequel) departed somewhat from the novels; it's a crime that this third production leaves Montgomery behind entirely, transporting her characters forward in time, pitchforking them into a trite war plot, and resolving the incoherent plot elements with a tepid, candy-coated ending.
0	dissapointed to say the least: I remember watching the Anne of Green Gables and Anne of Avonlea movies as a child from start to finish and then immediately rewinding them to start again. This movie is an intirely different story. Not only was it a far cry from the book version, I found it to be incredibly insulting. The anti-American sediment found throughout the movie is something that I took to heart and I belive that Kevin Sullivan did a wonderful job at alienating much of his audience by the thoughtless comments made in this film. I have about as much respect for him now, as he has for half of the people who have supported him by buying his movies. I will never buy another one of his films and unfortunatly, this is a movie that I will never share with my own children.
0	Not the same as Anne1 & 2.: This was a major disappointment. I loved the first and second of the Anne series, but this one does not have the same feel or charm that made Anne1 and 2 so loved. Its like its not Kevin Sullivan making this. Its far to artsy and revolves around the war rather than the characters and green gables. They hardly even show green gables and it even gets burned down. (How could they do that!). I wish I'd never watched this, as its ruined the way I imagined Anne and the others to have lived, happily ever after is what I expected.
0	Soooooo disappointed: I was so happy when I borrowed this movie from our local library. Now I'm only happy that I borrowed it instead of purchasing it. The books were , basically, thrown out when this movie was made. I was so disappointed. I will not watch this sequel again. If you really liked the first two movies, I would not bother to watch the 3rd. It left me feeling sick to my stomach at such a gross departure from the books and story line.
0	Don't do it!!!!: The first two are wonderful but don't waste your time or money on the Continuing Story. It is awful, isn't even similar to the books and she does very un-Anne like things. Not worth it at all and very disappointing!
0	Has NOTHING in common with the Books!!!!: There is nothing---and I mean truly NOTHING---in common between the "Anne books" and this movie! It's quite horrible in every way. I wish I could give it negative stars! Yes, the second mini-series of this trilogy takes frequent license, but it retains enough episodes and character of the book to be quite enjoyable in it's own way. THIS little "thing" simply keeps a few character names, retains several original actors, and truly and completely makes up a story out of whole cloth. If they were in such an itch to make a WWI "Anne," they could (and should) have made 'Rilla. But they made this atrocity instead. If you have ANY respect for the book, please just forget this movie exists. Hideous!
0	Big Problems with Amazon's Quality Control: The DVD did not match the title of the cover. Literally the wrong movie was in the "Anne of Green Gables - The Continuing Story" sleeve. Pretty much of a let down. Come on Amazon get on your suppliers.Joe
1	great movie great service: my daughter and I love this movie. we have been watching it since she was a child she is now in her 20's and we still watch it together.
0	Darcy: On it's own, the movie is a very decent sort. However, it's quite disgusting the liberties Kevin Sullivan took with the storyline while pretending it was a continuation of the Anne of Green Gables story. I was very disappointed.
0	I am very disappoinsted.: This film lost simple life of characters and sense of humor of basis of Anne's series.
0	Not as Good: I didn't like the Continuing Story as much as Green Gables and Avonlea. I guess Anne and Gilbert was all grown up in the Continuing Story. Didn't really like the war atmosphere, felt so sad.
1	still a riot, more hilarious: After reading Bitter with Baggage, I didn't think there could be a more spot on, hilarious take of a chick's life, that is until I picked up Going for the Bronze.Tanen captures a women's life and relationships, and the angst and humor that goes along with both brilliantly! This is the perfect book to share with a friend having a bad day--I've turned many a friend's tears of frustration into tears of laughter with a mere flip of the page. It's also the ideal book to share with each other to make a good day even better.If these crazy little chicks could talk, they'd make great guests on Oprah. Wait, if they could talk, they'd have their own show, and Oprah would be their guest.
0	Not what I had expected: This course while extensive in activities, was not what I had expected. The course did not start out basic such as learning basic communication between two people. I think this course is better for someone who is some-what fluent in French already. In addition, this course is however good for refreshment or learning more where it comes to things such as ordering dinner or renting an apartment.
0	DRIVE-IN SECOND FEATURE: "Are you really going out with him?""UH-HUH"."By the way, where did you meet him?""I MET HIM AT THE CANDY STORE AND THEN WE WENT OUT IN HIS CONVERTABLE AND PLAYED CHICKEN WITH A COP.""Cool.

1	Very good!!!: Is it just me or does anybody else notice that the production standards on this disc aren't up to those of his other recordings? Play this album back to back with So and you will notice that the sound on So is much crisper and cleaner. Anyway, the musical content on this album is right up there with So and in some instances surpasses it. Oh sure, there are the obligatory "I'm only putting this tune on the disc in hopes that I'll get radio airplay" songs Steam and Kiss that Frog in which he tries to repeat the success of "Sledgehammer". Otherwise the songs on Us are some of the best that PG's ever done either lyrically or musically. Even the early nineties hit "Digging in the Dirt" is a pretty complex look into the psyche. If you like So, you'll be pleasantly surprised by Us. And BTW, if you like Us, check out Plus From Us which is a compilation of music from the musicians which appeared on, and inspired the music of, Us.
0	Spend a little more and get a better router: I have owned and have friends that own different routers then this one and none are as bad. Two major problems with this router:1. Wireless range is BAD (I own a cheap router and it has twice the range)2. Router loves to disconnect from the internet when multiple PC's are accessing the internet at once.I have the latest firmware which states it addresses the disconnect problem but doesn't. Hopefully they will come out with a new version soon!
0	Easy setup, poor range: I bought this unit after my Linksys wireless router died; I can therefore only compare it to the Linksys.Setup was EXTREMELY quick and easy. I got it up and running in just a few minutes. The UI of the admin app is very straight forward and I notice is strangely similar to the UI of SMC routers. I find it to be somewhat easier to work with than the Linksys UI.I am unfortunately not pleased with the transmission range of this router. I placed it in the exact same location that the Linksys had been in. A computer that was getting solid100% connection strength with the Linksys is now only getting 50% with this unit. Another machine that was getting around 70% on the Linksys would not connect at all to this unit until it was moved to a different location.This would be an excellent unit were it not for the range problem... Perhaps there's a fix?
0	DO NOT BUY THIS!!!: From the first day I bought this product it had problems.....I called my service provider and we established that my connection is fine.....its definitely the router!! I called Belkin tech support and they tried to sell me service support in order to fix my problem!!! I managed to fix the problem for a few weeks but it RETURNED!! The thing keeps losing connection and i have to unplug and replug the darn thing to get it going again!! Its a pain! i wish i had spent a few dollars more and got a decent router!!
0	Repeatedly Hangs: This router has good functionality and ease of use, but reliability is more important for me and this router hangs about once a day, so I'm giving it1 star. You need to unplug the power cord and plug it back in every time to get it to work again.The range is a bit disappointing, too. About 30ft indoors.On the plus side,128bit WEP and ability to limit access by MAC address are nice, and it's very easy to set up.Reading around some forums makes me think that the hanging problem is not universal, so if you're lucky enough to get one that works, it's not a bad router if you don't need long range wireless.For me, I'm returning it for a refund.
1	Good Solid Cordless Phone: I was very surprised to see ony two stars for this phone. I have had one for over two years and this phone has been a good solid performer. I am a self-proclaimed gadget freak and have tried many different cordless phone brands. I think that Panasonic and Sony make the best phone and I think that Panasonic, while the cheaper of the two generally makes better equipment. With two small kids ours has been dropped and moved multiple times and has never given us trouble. It has provided better clarity than my more expensive Sony phones as well. I will admit that the features that are jammed into this phone are a bit over the top but this is a very useful phone. In fact, I'm on the site to purchase one for my mom. Happy Holiday!
0	ditto to horrible battery life...: my first panasonic 2563 works great...this 2583 won't hold a charge for more than10 minutes talk time...and it's only two weeks old!!!!!!!!!!customer service offered to replace it with a refurbished model when all i'm looking for is a new battery...i paid top dollar so that i could trade it in two weeks later for a refurbished unit...........i'm very dissapointed with them...never another panasonic.
0	Lousy support after the sale: We lost the handset. Called Panasonic to get a replacement, they would not sell us a replacement handset. Overall disappointed with Panasonic and this phone.
0	Disappointed consumer: I had a Uniden phone for over10 years which I loved. Unfortunately lighting hit and blew out all my phone lines and phones. I spent a lot of time trying to find the right phone and thought I had. I bought this phone about11/2 years ago, not only does the battery go dead quickly but I have already had to replace the battery. Then my keypad started to wear out. I do not use the phone and/or keypad excessively. I was sure it was a defect so I called Panasonic. The options they gave me were completely unacceptable. I am now shopping for a new phone and it certainly will not be a Panasonic no matter what the reviews or features are.
0	Panasonic 2563W: Not very happy with the clarity of this phone. Also, very uncomfortable the way it rests on my ear and it also feels like I am talking into an echo. Taking it back to Staples tomorrow. Overpriced. Unsure of what else to buy. Just glad to dispose of it.
1	Amazing set of cookware!: Its been a very long time since I reviewed anything...but this set deserves my time to review. Though I bought this set elsewhere, I bought other pieces from amazon with the 4-for-3 offer to complete the set. I cook twice everyday and I have to say, Ive loved cooking with these pots! The 8 qt stockpot that comes with the set is what I use very sparingly, given its size...making it slightly unuseable for my small family of 4. Otherwise I got the 3.5 qt casserole, 2 qt & 3 qt. saucepans. I also got a 6 qt stockpot and pretty much those cover all my cooking needs. Very heavy and will certainly last a lifetime. I havent cooked with All-clad yet, so I cant comment if this set is comparable, but All-clad is definitely in my list :)
1	Yes another live album, but this is diferent.....: There are interesting facts about the released of stripped:- Basically it is an "unpugged album" from the Stones.- It was the very first interactive cd.When I first bought this cd, it was the very first interactive multimedia record ever done (booklet came with instructions, intercative material, etc...also appears the very first Rolling stones site, by1994 whe the internet was so new, the site shows only merchandise in just a few pages, all those years ago), it is very interesting looking and hearing "hidden tracks".Also, during the Voodoo Lounge tour, the Stones perform some "surprise gigs" in some cities.In the time of the Unplugged records, this is a testimony of great tracks recorded in a different way we used to hear the Stones.It is a great album, quite diferent, and of course "Like a Rolling Stones", a classic made a classic.
1	Is Good: Yet another live Stones album, but it's good. Like most live albums from these guys, you get a combination of spendidly done covers (by the world's most underrated cover band) and Stones standards. My favorites are: the grinding rendition of Street Fighting Man, the fresh delivery of Shine A Light, and the must-have pairing of iconic band with iconic title on Like A Rolling Stone. If you are looking at this with any consideration at all, go ahead - you can't lose. This also comes with the reassurance that even though this band really hasn't given us much new worth listening to in about 25 years, at least they haven't lost their ability to put it out on stage (at least, as of the mid-90's when this was done).
1	Unbelievable: I'll echo exactly what the previous 2 reviewers wrote, this film is amazing, unbelievable, almost beyond words. Here is a church, probably minutes away from our White House and our Congress (these who are supposed to be taking care of their neighborhood, which would be the whole, United States.) Anyway,The church is filled with people who support each other, and improve their neighborhood with knowledge, job training, peaceful demonstrations, free healthcare, and much more. The church seems to me, to be exactly what a church is meant to be.
1	Our gritty female ancestors were amazing!: I started reading this little gem while researching material for an historical fiction novel and soon discovered that I couldn't get enough of their stories. Before reading this book, I was guilty of looking back at our history never imagining the grit and humor our ancestors possessed. A great read.
1	Possibly Gabriel's best solo work: I was surprised to see some relatively-negative comments directed towards PG's second solo album. I recently re-visited this album after many years, and found that while some of the more popular albums (#3 and Security) have not aged particularly well, this one stands the test of time. I would rate this as PG's best solo album (or at least my favorite). Not as pretentious as the albums that followed it, but darkly moving.
1	Fantastic SACD: This was never advertised as a multi-channel SACD and I am glad that they didn't try to reformat it. The definitive edition of Peter Gabriel's work is all on SACD now and are must-haves for any fan with an SACD player. What many people do not realize about SACD is that the sampling rate is 2.8 MILLION samples-per-second as opposed to a normal CD which is only 44.1 THOUSAND sps. It is as close to an analog stream that you can get.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. If you don't have a good ear for audio and a good stereo system to listen to high-definition audio on then obviously you will not hear the difference. But for Audiophiles? A dream come true.
1	What a great 80's movie: I watch this movie over and over. I've watched since I was a little girl and I still love it to this day. It's a very addicting movie.
0	girls just want to have fun: I am really dissappointed with Amazon. This product was meant to be delivered to me on the19 March 2008. To date it has not been delivered, i have paid for it . I have tried to contact Amazon customer services to no avail. I will never purchase anything from the amazon website again.
0	fake product: Dear all,I received this Ultraviolet Man Liquid Metal Summer by Paco Rabanne and I was very disappointed. It is a fake product. The bar code was replaced by another one. Someone cut out the original barcode. I used it and after 30 minutes I could not smell the perfume anymore. Terrible product I want my money back.
1	A Keeper: Signature Killers was informative, educational, and kept me focussed and intrieged by the minds of criminals. By using different case studies, Robert Keppel brings into review some of the most disturbing crimes and analyzes the root and causes of these human diviances. A definate "keeper" in my books!
0	Truth or Hype, Mr. Keppel?: I found that in at least one case mentioned in this book, information given to readers was not necessarily true. Was this book written after researching past newspaper articles or was it really from experience? I now realize how John Q. Public is lead by the nose into believing whatever hype will sell. Once again, the public is lead on a lynching, without the complete truth available. Look out for the boogyman - he still makes money for some people. I am disappointed in the book, knowing that if one case was based on public hype, how can I believe anything else in the book?
0	Save your money unless you like pain: All I did was walk down a hallway twice in my house and both little toes feel as if they were cut up by razor blades. They look comfy but the front strap is stiff and just cuts right into your toes. Beware.
0	There is no such thing as out smarting wall street!!: Is there really such a thing as out smarting wall street? They could have easily titled this book how to buy stocks that go up and short stocks that go down. Remember this book is from folks who don't know how to make profit in the business they run? Do you really want to learn how to invest from these people?
1	Great Gun: Bought my nail gun about 2 yrs ago. Have driven many 21/2 in nails in oak, maple,cherry and pine and never had a misfire or jam once. Like this gun so much I bought one for my father-in-law for christmas. And yes I like him. Would recommend this finish nailer to anyone.
0	It was a great finish nailer unitl it broke.: I bought the nailer over a year ago and use it every few weeks when I get some finish work. It is light weight and it is easy to clear jams. One day it would not fire. I took it to be rebuilt and had an estimate of $100. The guy called and told me it needs a new firing mechanism and it would cost $189. So I am ordering the Hitachi today.
0	Didn't work with Windows XP: Ok, so Windows XP might be a bit advanced for such an inexpensive camera, but I wanted a very basic webcam I could talk to my significant other with for a few months while we're apart. This camera didn't come with drivers for Windows XP. I went to the website and downloaded what they said were the XP drivers, but still couldn't get it to work. I had my partner try to get it to work on my computer, he couldn't get it to work, and he's a computer guy! I finally sent it back and my brother-in-law and partner told me to go for the Logitech. I gave this one star because it didn't work for me...it might work perfectly well on all other OS's, but not on XP.
0	Product does not work with windows XP: The product is most likly good. But It when I try to install it to my computer, the class install manager denied my request to install it. This was very frustrating beacaues I have to return it. The Micro Innovations customer service was terrible, the people would lie over the phone just to get rid of you. The man said he would e-mail me the drivers I needed to install it to my computer with windows XP. But never sent them. Non of this is Amazons fault but I wish that they show weather its compatible with windows XP.
1	AWESOME: It's was an amazing start to one of the best journey's I've ever read. I feel honored to have been given it as a gift, an orignial copy, from my mother. I felt more honored to give her the other two books in the series as a gift, she had never known about. It's a series you curl up with on a winter's day that calls for a warm blanket and a serious lack of anything to do but travel back in time.
1	A good look of life at the opening of the frontier: An interesting book from both a literary and historical standpoint. A view into the lives and struggles of the first settlers of the Dakotas. A good read, particularly for those with an interest in America's Scandinavian immigrants.
1	Book club selection.: Our local book club decided to read and discuss this for December.I found the book slow-moving at times but well worth the effort!
0	Cheap made product: After getting tired of looking for batteries for our other sharpeners, I decided to look for a sharpener closer to what I used in school. Well this one is not it. After three uses, the entire collection cup just came off and would not go back on after adjusting every way imaginable. In order to sharpen a pencil, the cup must be on securely and ours was just flat out broken. Also the pad on the bottom of the unit was very loose upon opening but we were still able to make it suction to our granite. Don't waste your money on this cheap plastic.
0	Broke After a Few Months: I got this for my kids to use at home and for a few months it was a good little sharpener. Suction works well, not messy to dump out the shavings, etc. However, the teeth on the wheels grinded too much and stopped making the sharpening piece inside to turn.
0	this player [stinks]: This player is great for DVDs, unfortunately I bought the player for its 5 disc cdr/mp3 playability. The player makes 2 second jumps on every song of every cdr I own. I took it in to get fixed. When I got it back, I plugged it in and still does the same thing.
0	Very disappointed.: I had to return my bottle, because the1st thing I noticed when I opened it was the odor, and the capsules literally looked like they had been put in an oven and toasted! They had a burned smell. I had been trying to take them for my digestive problems, but these were actually making me worse! Very defective bottle. I will not be ordering them again from Vitamin Shoppe if this is what you get. I have been taking Betaine Hydrochloride for several months, and this is the first time I've ever had a problem. I had been buying them from the local health food store, but was trying to save money getting them on Amazon.
0	Terrible product: This is a terrible product. I have had the device not working error (10) and have tried every configuration. Buy something else and not Belkin networking.
0	Luke-warm outline of a great American's life.: In "Founding Father" Richard Brookhiser attempts a moral biography of George Washington which focuses on his public life, all in order to bring him closer to us 200 years later. While a noble effort, Brookhiser does not follow through. Although mildly interesting, this book is too sketchy and reads as a mere outline of a more comprehensive work. There are better works out there that bring Washington closer to our hearts than this one.
1	A Brilliant Catalog of Psychological Disorders: What do an amnesiac, an assassin, a chronic compulsive, and an institutionalized lunatic have in common? They all enjoy residence on this incredible album by Peter Gabriel.The amazing lyrical territory is matched by unprecedented sonics, which married dry guitars, erratic keyboards, with heavily gated drums (which would later become Phil Collins trademark sound).One of the greatest albums of the decade.
0	Another Cheryl cullen disappointment: This is one of the worst brochure design books I have ever seen. Outdated design and most of them from the United States.More like a marketing tool for Cheryl Dangel Cullen's designer friends.most of the designs dont even show the brochure covers.Another huge disappointment from Cheryl Dangel Cullen(same with Global graphics:colour and Global graphics: symbols, both of which are showcases of wrong information.)I wouldnt even give one star, but that is the bottom of the barrel!
1	Heed my advice!!!: I had a lot of trouble getting this to work with Windows XP, but to all those people out there who are having the same trouble, THIS CARD WILL WORK, it is just a real pain getting it to do so. After spending hours trying myself and using tech support, I figured out the problem on my own. First of all, you must download the XP drivers from the Belkin website. THEN, you need to use the utility that comes on the CD rom, *NOT* the generic one for Windows XP. Besides the setup trouble, the card works fine, the price is right and I have no complaints [now].
0	Broken Drivers for Windows XP: I've had a horrible time with this F5D6020 PCMCIA card. I'm quite adept with wireless networks - have two laptops and several desktops with wireless cards in them. Some of the biggest problems I've had have been with this Belkin card, Windows Zero Configuration for wireless networks, and WEP secured networks. I connect to wireless networks, secured and unsecured, just fine, but the drivers are mangling ARP, and so I can't run TCPIP over the connection.Despite the fact that the card is advertised to work with XP, it doesn't include signed drivers - and the drivers it does have are what's wrong with it.
1	Earth Crisis said "All Out War!": And here it is haha!As soon as I heard there was a movie about straight-edge kids coming out I freaked. First I thought it was goin to be like a Hollywood straight-edge thing where they'd confuse edge with emo or something and I didn't want to see some edgers whining about girls. But then I heard it was made in the NYHC so I was super excited when I saw it at Tower. The first half was ok it was kind of boring and there were black & white parts that I still don't know why they were black & white, but once the riot begins it goes off like nothing you've ever seen before. Props to the filmmakers for some violence that's as real looking as Boston Beatdown, which actually is real! I just wish they could have played Project X "Straight-edge Revenge!" during the riot haha O.L.D.!!!
0	Keys Unresponsive, would not respond to keystrokes...: Received this keyboard today and was very dissapointed. I can't believe IBM actually allowed Micro Innovations to put their logo on this item. When typing, the keystrokes either were not recognized or would display seconds later. Receiver "data" light blinks showing that are you pressing keys, however, the keystrokes are not sent to the computer.Returning item now as I type on a good/working LOGITECH wireless RF keyboard.
1	Has lasted years and passed on from older brother to little brother.: This item was bigger than expected which was a very nice surprise. It has lasted for several years used by one boy then passed on to his younger brother when he was interested in looking a bugs. It is easy to store on a shelf and find when suddenly a bug springs up that a boy wants to take a closer look at. the mesh cover is somewhat transparent but the best view is from the clear acrylic door not the side. No bug has ever accidentally escaped yet.
1	Elvira Madigan: This DVD of a1967 Swedish movie was just as I have remembered it when it was first released. Great photography and great background music. A most enjoyable film that can safely be viewed by all the family.
1	goo product: good product and works good on my hunting vehicle never comes off even in wooded areas when hit by limbs
1	Good quality: It's a good product for11m band CB Radio, not too long and long enough for a SWR acceptable.there is also a rubber cover on the pedestal who can prevent from the paint damage
1	Magnet mount antennas: Simple. Effective. Easy. Portable. Switchable between vehicles. Inexpensive for what you get. It doesn't get any better does it?? :-) I could make this long and add a bunch of tech notes ie ease of adjusting SWR; effective range etc etc, but I think it is unnecessary. If you need more than a good CB, time to move up to the HAM world.
1	Still Great: Still Life captures the sounds from the band's Tattoo You tour, which was their first extensive tour of the US in several years. The band sounds tight and revitalized. It is interesting to hear them play "Start Me Up" as it is was a new song at the time and they hadn't yet played it a million times. "Shattered" and "Just My Imagination" are roaring and their version of The Miracles "Going To A Go-Go" is a crowd pleaser. "Under My Thumb" is another very strong cut and it has a unusual, but perfectly fitting, intro with Duke Ellington's "Take The 'A' Train". Still Life shows the band at the peak of their concert playing, where the songs still sound fresh and haven't become old warhorses.
1	Time really is on their side.: I remember I used to hate "The Stones" for years. The local stations would just run them into the ground and completely ruin them for me. Now, as an adult, I can't get enough of them!I just recently got this CD and thought it was a great live show. Maybe not one of their best but great all the same. Good mix. Good selection of songs. Very energetic. I would recommend this to any Stones fan, young and old.
0	Spare yourself the agony and rent Chinatown instead: This sequel to Chinatown must be one of the most disappointing films I have ever seen. It is badly written, badly directed (by star Jack Nicholson), and contains bland performances by two of my favorite actors, Nicholson and Harvey Keitel.Spare yourself the agony of wasting 99 cents on renting this turkey and rent the masterpiece Chinatown instead.
0	Shapeless sack: This is a shapeless sack with pockets. Absolutely no thought has gone into design. When you are carrying 40 lbs on you, distribution of weight becomes critical, else you are likely to end up with a major case of backache. Having used the vest a few times and each time spending the following day in bed, I can vouch that the manufacturer has spent no effort in designing the product. I have an Altius (20 lbs). What a wonderful vest!
1	Great Movie: I was lucky to see this movie on TCM not long ago, and enjoyed every moment of it. I would absolutely love to own it on DVD......sooner rather than later. Fabulous move, and Cary Grant is great in it!!
0	Too small: The color is great and so is the feel. I love jersey knit. I have a pillow-top matress and the fit was pretty snug right off. I wish I would have returned them right away, because I knew that once I washed them they would shrink. I did tumble dry on low, but they shrunk considerably, and even with stretching they are just too small for my mattress. These are not meant for a pillow-top. So I gave them away to someone who has a full and they fit perfectly.

1	Computer gamer: This is a good quality game and it's played a lot in our household. We play one-person "Mahjong" very often here (maybe too often?) and everyone from the adults to the 8 year old is hooked on this particular game. There's a two person version as well, but it's not as big of hit in our household. The graphics on the tiles are detailed, so this may not be a game for laptop size screens, but works just fine on regular larger monitors. You've also got the option to choose different tile graphics and layouts, which might help. One reason we purchased it is so that it could be played both on the Mac and the MS PC and it does that well. It has some fun sounds as the tiles are matched and removed. If you have the CD in, you get the sounds. Without the CD, no cute sounds, but the game goes faster, so it depends on what you want. I like the quality, the flexibility, and the challenge of the Mahjong game offered in this CD.
0	A Negative Tren: We had the old DOS version of Hoyle Solitaire (1988 Copyright) and when I bought a new computer we wanted to update to a current version. Installed new version and found the following:1.) Autoplay disappeared. Lets one play out finished game without manually clicking each card. 2.) Replay game is missing. Sometimes it took several tries to win a game, but this is gone now; you can't try again. I re-installed the old version from1988 (One1.4MB diskette) and find it better than the current version. Any owner of the old DOS version who buys this version will be severely disappointed; you spent money to downgrade to an inferior product.
0	Henryk Sienkiewicz Trilogy box: After a month waiting not received yet !!!Ordered 22nd February 2011Copenhagen, 26th March 2011
0	Read the books...skip the movie.: I love Louis L'Amour, especially his epic series: The Sacketts. The stories are believable, tautly written and accessible for just about anyone. Unfortunately, the same cannot not be said about this movie, which is based upon two of the stories: The Daybreakers and Sackett. With great anticipation I watched this movie. I wanted to enjoy it, but no matter how hard I tried I coundn't for one simple reason: The acting is atrocious! Tom Selleck is awful. Mercedes McCambridge is awful (really awful), and sadly, worst of all is Glenn Ford. The best acting comes from the veterans Ben Johnson and Sam Elliot, barely. What frustrates me is that these are talented actors! What kind of direction were they receiving from Robert Totten?? "One take and next scene" must have been his credo. Really disappointing.Don't waste your money. Read the books instead.
0	How to Handcolor like a Hallmark Artist.: This book is great if you want to stick to only one medium, Marshall Photo Oils. The examples are sappy and saccharine.Cutesy kids, flowers, bla bla bla! This book copies the style and explanations of Handcoloring Photographs Step by Step by Laird. Thats because Dorskind has nothing to say herself and doesn't know how to explain. Now you should buy the book by Laird. I, like most reviewers recommend it strongly. I also highly recommend to you Handtinting Photographs. Buy this book too. Don't buy Dorskind's book. Its a waste of money.
1	You Must Listene to This CD: Wonderful poetry, interesting, slightly sad, personal, diverse, including some fragments (choral) in RussianInstrumental arrangments innovative, fusing pop sounds with Eastern colors and instruments (Ud?, Balalaika, Dombra?)The voice on the CD is intimate, powerful, very personal, sounds distinguish this CD from many pop recordings; some jazz elementsFavorite songs: Kabala, Sleep My Son, Queen of Night
0	Worst Dragonlance Book I Ever Read: I read my first Dragonlance more than10 years ago and I've been an ardent fan since. So when I got my hands on this one, I was full of expectations.However, this book was a real letdown. I had to force myself to go through each page and finally gave up. The narration sounded like sentences in childrens' books. The kender didn't seem to act or speak like kender and the gully drarves were either too smart or too irritating. The death knight wasn't much of a Death Knight nor was Takhisis her usual Godlike self.The author, being new to Dragonlance series should have done her homework better and found out more about the Dragonlance world we all know and love. This was really a waste of such a promising title as a book of short stories on Uncle Trapspringer's adventures would indeed be very welcome to the Dragonlance series.
1	It's Kim Carnes!!: How could you not love it? The double set saves half the storage space. A "must" for any Kim Carnes fan.
1	Open the Door: This is the beginning of an incredible series--and Ms. Duane says the fourth and final book is FINALLY coming out this year! I love Ms. Duane in all her shadings, but I believe this quartet is among her finest work. Every page is edged with light. Her characters are so real that I wish they lived down my block--so I could go talk to them and learn more about them. I can't wait for the fourth book. At last, at last!
1	My Fave Album Of All Time: My favorite song "Science of Silence". Trying to explain it could never do it justice. Just beauty personified. Music is amazingly beautiful. Thanks Sir Richard.
0	Portable red flashlight: Terrible product. Switch malfunctioned after just a few months and I could not find a replacement. Avoid purchasing this model if you expect long term use and reliability. I have had a number of flashlights in the past and this one really lowered my expectations.
1	Waechtersbach KIWI plates.: Waechetersbach (pronounced Veck ters bahk) dinner plates have got to be the most vibrant,colorful along with festive and great quality plates I have ever purchased. I bought the "Coupe" style in Kiwi. The "Rimmed" style seemed to be a brighter lime green color. The coupe style had a bit darker of a hue but I still think they are fabulos. Amazon had the plates at my door in a week. For more colors try Waechtersbach warehouse, or Waechtersbach usa.They are a bit on the expensive side... about12$ per plate, but so well worth it. :)Also: NOT microwavable (it will crack the colors on the ceramic) but dishwasher safe.
1	The Endearing Honesty of A Woman's Life: My husband happened upon a copy of the original book in a thrift store and brought it home. It has now found a place of honor on my shelves. It takes you on Diana's journey through her self-discovery as a lesbian, through her brother's rejection of it, to the pain of heartbreak, to the lover that was a recurring interference, and to finally resting comfortably and contendly in the arms of the love that would be to stay. The book takes you through her childhood, her travels, and her education. She presents the story of a lesbian who is not out to emmasculate men, nor to promote women as the supreme goddess. She simply walked the road of her soul.
1	I cant believe more people dont know this band: Since by man play some of the most passionate, energetic, and moving hardcore ive heard in a while... this album makes you want to dance in the street and flail your arms around like an idiot, and kiss some random girl getting out of her car and run like hell... what do they sound like? somewhere between converge and the swing kids with a little bit of refused... there are alot of really strong riffs and melodies on here, even though they are not always technical riffs. these guys just plain bring the rock, and you need to hear this if you like hardcore or punk... turn it up as loud as you can.
1	Fun History: I couldn't put this book down. If you are a history buff like me this is like brain candy. Nothing too in depth but a fun read.
0	Check out before you buy: The product looks ok. The buttons are nice and big and easy to read. They don't work very well though. For example when pushing on the speaker button to dial or answer the phone often I have to press it several times and just right for it to work. It does not come with the AC adapter and Northwestern Bell no longer makes or distributes them. Without the adapter the lights do not work, including the message waiting light. It is not what it was reported to be and does not function the way it is supposed to because it does not have an adapter. I have tried several stores such as Radio Shack, Best Buy, Walmart and Target to find an adapter (120VAC to 6V100mA) and cannot find one. I have not been able to find one online either. Also the product information indicates this phone takes 3 AA batteries. It does not. This one takes 4 AAA batteries. Not that the size of the batteries makes any difference to me, but the description is not accurate for the item. I am sending it back.
0	NO!NO!NO!: DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK. ... He makes incredible errors of historical fact-well known historical fact, at that. For heaven's sakes never mind his errors regarding the women's lives, he puts Warm Springs (where FDR died) in West Virgina instead of Georgia(and where were his editors?) His lack of understanding of the truth of women's lives is no worse than many otherwise credible male biographers. Read it with a spoonful of salt, and you will learn of many women who have been overlooked. Just know going in that you are reading what amounts to a shallow overview magazine type article. Not unenjoyable just disappointing. I ignored the whole rating thing which is absurd.
0	Get with the times: For those who don't want to be dragged into the new .net world. There is still asp...however, 2.0 is the old version, at least get 3.0
0	Worthless: As a beginner I found this book worthless. Many of the scripts in the book and on the CD apparently do not work. I asked a friend, who is a bright engineering student with programming experience, to try to try her hand at getting the guest book script to work and she didn't have any luck either. I submitted a question twice to the online Q&A forum over 3 weeks ago and it has yet to be posted, nor have I received any acknowledgement that the message was received. In my opinion this book fails on all counts. I advise beginners to look elsewhere.
1	The Best Wisdom Poetry Of Our Age: "The dead can tell us, being dead, what no living personcan tell us," wrote T.S. Eliot. What Masters has done for us(when he was alive) is write a collection of whispered epitaphs,voices silently crying out from the graves the ironies, sadnesses, wastes, agonies, and miscalculations of their spent lives.This is not poetry to turn a phrase, necessarily. Nor is it poetry to enchant. Instead, it is Wisdom Poetry. Poetry that carries the weight of mistakes of the twisted lives, creating their own kind of hell (Hobbes: "Hell is truth too late learned").Written in1915 and written as if for choral voices--wouldn't this be a great piece for a dramatic interpretation in which several voices perform each poem? Collected, it becomes overwhelming, just as a visit to a cemetary to mourn the losses of one of your loves can also be overwhelming.No, it is not sad, though. Somehow, hope still survives, like the shoot stabbing through the cracked granite toward the sun.
1	Could've used more guitar, but still good: The latest offering from Unit:187 is a little more geared towards total electronics than eletronics mixed with heavy guitars. But that doesn't make this a bad album. Most of the songs come off as instrumentals with Tod Law shouting one or two lines here and there. The electronics still have the trademark Unit:187 sound...very abrasive and harsh. I would've maybe liked to have seen more lyrics or guitars in these songs, but they're still good. My favorite is by far the title track, which opens the record. Both mixes of Anger Management are also good. If you have the other releases from the boys, pick this one up as well. It's worth it in my opinion.
1	LOVE this cookbook! Great old-fashioned recipes: Great cook book. A lot of great, tried and true recipes, like the standard Chocolate Chip Cookie and Peanut Butter Cookie. Love how they spell it 'Cooky' though. A few of the recipes are a bit outdated, like Prune cookies, but most of them have stood the test of time. Great fun to flip through, easy to read font, old-fashion little illustrations here and there and a lot of full colored pictures of the cookies. I have to say, some of the cookies aren't pretty, but they taste great. A true original and practical for children to use do to the ease of the ingredients and font style. Oh, and almost all of the recipes call for shortening, so substituting butter is a must. Great for collectors. Bought this to replace my Mom's original copy from the '60's.
1	Remember from my childhood: I love this book. Not just because I used to love making cookies with my mom years ago, but the variety of cookies make this book one of the best. Highly recommended.
1	Christmas all year: This is a treasure trove of wonderful cookie recipes. Pecan crispies are light and elegant. Thumbprint, Russian teacake, meringues and sugar cookies are holiday favorites. Shamrock cookies become witches' fingers for Halloween with just omission of food coloring and a different rolling technique. Almond butter, French lace, nut crunch cookies. Of course, there are hundreds more--your favorites, no doubt! I recommend buying this book if you bake, or if you hope to. But I will add, it's not the "original" Betty Crocker cookie book. My mother has that--from the 30's or 40's I think, smaller and with fewer recipes, but awesome. This version has vivid color photographs so you can drool--or occupy your kids with just visuals--while you consider what to make next!
1	Betty Crocker Cooky Book: Fast shipment, easy to find what I wanted. It was a gift for my daughter. Just what I ordered.....used but in very good condition. My daughter was very happy!
1	A FAMILY TREASURE: My girlfriend used this Cooky Book when her two daughters were growing up. They both treasure it, even though it is falling apart from so much use! When I discovered that it had been reprinted, I just had to purchase one for each of my friend's daughters. They were thrilled to each have their own copy. What a family treasure!!
1	Good stuff: When I listened to it, it made me miss Dream Street even more. I wish they had still stayed together and then the CD would have been all Dream Street songs! But regardless, it's a good CD! The new stuff is really good, but it was kind of weird putting "You're Taking Me Over" next to "With All My Heart" because their voices were still high in YTMO, but had dropped by WAMH. I also enjoyed hearing some of the redone old songs! If you like Dream Street, go out and buy this CD! Why are you still reading this? I said go out and buy it!
1	DS RULEZ!: Ok this is Dream Street...what more can i say? they are great and have amazing voices! This cd is awesome and the movie is too! The songs are catchy and u can tell there is a major voice change compared to their first cd. Also the song, With All My Heart, gets to me every time i listen to it its such a great song...one of their BEST! ok so anyways all i'm saying even though its been forever since the CD came out and since the Dream Street brake up that doesnt mean that you still can't support them...so hurry up and get the CD cuz there really isnt that many copies left, well the last time i checked there wasn't...ok thats all i gotta say.
0	They sounded better in their debut: As you grow up, your voices mature. They are suppose to get better. This did not work for Dream Street, unfortunately. Their debut is so much better, even though Jesse was what,14 and sounding as Aaron Carter did when he was11. I think it's highly unnecessary for a soundtrack, just because they are in the movie, to have 65% of the songs theirs. The only songs I really liked on this is "I Say Yeah" (which is, again, WAY better w/ the original version) and "I'm Gonna Make You Love Me", even though I dislike Play, I thought the song was pretty cute and Chris added a nice 'flair' to it.
1	DOLPH LUNDGREN ROCKS!!!!!!!!!: i love this film.dolph in his best film role.this is the movie that made me a fan of his.lee is awsome too.the best ninja type film i've ever saw.
0	Only got the NT for luke: Not the book it should be. I am very disappointed since i got the wrong item. Please do not sell books to people if you are not giving what is shown. On a positive note, I understand we all make mistakes! Please dont do this again however to anyone besides myself. Honesty really is the best policy! God bless you!!!
1	The funniest movie about the 60s ever: . . . and it comes from France! Set around a funeral, a family gathered - perhaps for the very last time - in grief, and in the midst of a near-revolution, The May Fools manages to cover the entire history of the 60s through hope, euphoria, and paranoia, back to a cynical, sad reality. Still one of the funniest movies ever made.I am fortunate to have an old video tape of it. I am writing this in the hope that someday it will be released on DVD for American audiences.
1	Excelente, como todos los libros de él.: Es una lectura muy amena, para el que sabe un poco del idioma astrológico, sin embargo es fácil de leer, y el libro a diferencia de otros de SA está escrito de una forma más informal debido a que es tipo conferencias de pregunta y respuesta.Es un excelente complemento para el otro libro del mismo autor Person to Person Astrology.
0	I'm sure it's useful if you could read the print!!: This Concordance has the SMALLEST print I've ever seen in ANY book!! Even with my reading glasses I have to squint in order to make out the print. I even tried a magnifying glass but gave up. I don't know who would able to use this book. I wasted my money since I can't even read it!!
0	Not complete does not offer the original word next to the Translation: I am very disappointed to see what this book ended up being. I was expecting a Compact version of my Strong's Concordance but they changed it to the point of worthlessness. It is worth lugging the big book around in order to see the truth.For example you will never know from this book that YHWH (Hebrew 3068) is used nearly 7,000 times in the Hebrew scriptures.
1	Struggles with Faith: There's no getting around it: regardless of his actual faith, Joseph Arthur is a Christian folk rocker. Nothing wrong with that, just a fact that grounds the sixteen stellar tracks of his third release Redemption's Son. Though his belief runs deep, the thrill in his work is that his faith doesn't come without continuous struggle. Like his idol (and label-owner) Peter Gabriel, Arthur turns experience of the day-to-day into the epic. Unlike Gabriel, his music is still in touch with the simple verities. He keeps his progressive tendencies in check, relying on solid narrative details and the ragged beauty of his countertenor. The title cut, "Dear Lord", "Evidence" - each root their moral struggle in a recognizable situation: absentee father, social estrangement, addiction. The drawback is that every song reaches the same conclusion - there's nothing that God can't put right. Still, it's a testament to Arthur's gifts that the end doesn't nullify the journey.
1	The Complete Idiot's Guide to Online Genealogy, Second Edition: Very informative for the novice Genealogist. Helpful hints of where to look for information both online and in the library.
1	Miseducation is an impressive show of Lauryn's talents: My favorite songs on this album are "Too good to be true" and "Ex-Factor". Lauryn's singing/rapping talents are amazing! (Not to mention her acting talents,too) I was impressed by her strong voice and incredible rhythm. This album definitly deserves the grammys it was nominated for. I can't wait for Lauryn's next album and would absolutly love to see her perform live!!!
0	last reviewers info: would like to know where you got that info on lauryn hill saying she'd rather her kid starve than let her cd get in hands of a white person... i am a 'white' woman and am considering buying this... cuz i like her values and morals that i heard her sing of when a friend played 'to zion' for me. i am a christian and i rarely listen to secular stuff, but consider buying this...but not if she hates 'white people'. would like to know the source of your info, lem.
1	A blend of beauty and magic!: This CD is magical, the lyrics are deep. I've been a Lauryn Hill fan from the way back days of the Fugees and she's simply AWESOME. It's no surprise she nabbed 5 Grammys from this album, her first solo. This represents what good music should be, just buy it and listen to it's magic!!! To say the truth, this album deserves10 stars!!! Lauryn, I thank God for your life and inspiration, keep up the good work!!!
1	Classic Lauren: Lyrics are very relavent to these days and times that we live in. Music is awesome, vocals are still hot!
1	Lauren you're the best and keep getting better: Lauren I love you and your music I generally don't liste to younger artists because of the violence they promote, but you're style is so different and you give all honor to God first and foremost. The CD is just "Awesome" keep up the good work.
0	Simultaneously pretentious and moronic: This is even more brain-dead than the average rap CD. She's certainly pretty enough; why can't she hire someone to write her some decent songs to sing? Or one even.
1	Lauryn Hill is an exceptional music artist.: For anyone who is knowledgeable about music artists, you can only say one thing about Lauryn Hill. She is totally blessed with an extreme talent. Her music is so profound because so many can relate to her realness. It is clearly evident that when a host of people are moved with your music, you have touched a place universal in the hearts of those who have listened. When I first heard Lauryn in "Sister Act" and found out that she was a rapper in the group "Fugees", I said WHY? No disrespect towards rappers, I simply was floured when I heard her sing, I knew right then that I would be hearing more from her in the near future and it was manifested in her debut album. I am an artist myself and I would love to get the opportunity to work with her one day. "She is what you call a music perfectionist". And how beautiful to know where all the credit comes from, GOD. She is one who truly knows why she is so successful.
0	A decent album, I've heard a lot better though...: Although I'll admit this CD has its charms, I firmly believe that it should not garner a five star rating. The detriments to this album include the following: first, the album is full of Lauryn Hill speaking inane lyrics that faintly resemble some sort of electronica instrument; second, the songs lack differentiation (as in they are mostly the same beat.); and finally, the bitter lyrics really give me a headache. (Disregard the rambling run-on sentances.)
1	This Lauryn Hill at her best.: This is one of the most sincere, heartfelt cd's I've listened to. The tunes are great. My favorite song is #16. P.S. Her hidden tracks make for a nice surprise.
1	Individuality coupled with Tradition: Words can only do a disservice to the scope and deep emotion that this album not only invokes, but also infuses in its listeners.Listening to this one remembers the strength and power personified in the great Sojourner Truth's epochal poem, "Ain't I A Woman."Listen to it yourself and you will see...you sure are a woman Lauryn Hill.
0	I would give it no stars if it was available!!: This album, is so full of phony music, "Lauren, honey you dissappointed me, I guess I'll stick to the Fugees, rather than on your solo" This album has no real freshness, it all sounds the same, all the songs are of about the same beat, there is nothing that lift my soul to even want to sing along with her lyrics, the only one is that last song, in the album, which is an oldie just revised to a new version. I really thought she could have done a lot better especially with winning all those grammy's.
0	i would have givin it less!!!!!!: i would give this less cuz shes a terrible person and artist...the only reason i bought this cd is because she said she would rather have her kids starve then a white person get her cd...well....im waiting!!!!!
0	not even1 star: utter garbage - give me $1.00 for every flat note lauren hill hits on this album and I would be a millionaire
0	I laughed hard when I heard about her Medusa snake-hairstyle: Bah! not worth much. hip-hop you say? Maybe Bull-hop is more applicable here. get a clue about real rap artists miss Medusa!
0	What is the big fuss about!!: It's funny, I can never figure out the music business and MTV any more. This is the most overrated, overhyped album I have ever heard, and yet they talk about it like it's gods gift to music fans. I admit there are a couple of tracks on this album that I like, but the rest forget about it. Being a somewhat introspective person myself, I understand that this album is a personal expression of sort, but where is the melody on most of these tracks? I love soulful, heartfelt music as much as the next guy, and I think maybe some other artists out there can learn that from Lauryn; however there isn't much else in this album. I think Brandy is much better than Lauryn, but doesn't get nearly the credit she deserves.
0	I HATE RAPP: THIS JUST GOES TO SHOW THAT THERE AREN'T ENOUGH GOOD ARTIST AROUND, THAT THEY WOULD NAME A RAPP ARTIST AS BEST OF ANYTHING.
1	Great CD: After buying this CD for its hype, I became an instant Lauryn Hill fan. All songs on the CD were fantastic. Some better than others, but all good. My favorites are "to Zion", "Ex-Factor", & "Forgive them Father". If you like hip hop you will love this CD!
1	Greatest of all times.: Of course everyone knows that this album is a masterpiece. It's Lauyrn's greatest work. Regardless what people say about Lauryn Hill she is remarkable. She's like no other human being ya know. I love the Miseducation of Lauyrn Hill, this is my 5 time buying the cd, the first 2 times someone stole it from me and the other 2, I wore the cds out listening to them so much.
1	Real Hip-Hop flava from a really tight artist...: This album shows that artist can really feel their music instead of just throwing lyrics together. If you feel this C.D., check out the Roots, Tribe called Quest, Black Eyed Peas, and Common.
1	Very Good: I thought this video was very good. I haven't seen other versions, so I can't compare them, but I think it portrays the book excellently (although the book IS of course, better). The first tape is the best. Daniel Radcliffe does a wonderful job playing young David. The plot also follows the book and even the lines in the book very well. The character are cast perfectly. Mr. Murdstone is horrible, Mr. and Mrs. Micawber are exactly how they are in the book! In the second tape, I wish they hadn't cut out the part with the old Doctor, or Tommy Traddles. They focused more on his relationship with Dora and Agnes in the movie, whereas there are many themes going on at once in the book. Also some little things, like Agnes doesn't seem to take quite so kindly to Dora in the movie as she does in the book. But Maggie Smith is excellent as Betsy Trotwood (of course). Overall, this is a fabulous movie. Even if you haven't read the book, you'll want to after you see this.
0	Drags: I enjoyed the beginning of this book, but after a while it just drags. Could have been a nice story in the New Yorker, but as a book it just doesn't cut it. Forced my way to the end.Summary: Couple of guys want to get to this obscure place cause they like the name. Jump through lots of hoops trying to get permission. One of them dies. Permission comes. That's all folks.
1	I'll NEVER buy another Creative Card: Wow! I love this card.Easy to install. Setup on XP was no problem at all.Deep, rich sound (Naked Music has never sounded so good). Played Counter-Strike, footsteps were crisp and clear.I recently purchased a Creative Audigy card; after install somewhat random system crashes plauged my heretofore fine system. I call the crashes somewhat random because they occurred randomly while playing counter-strike and always when I tried to play sound from two different programs.Driver updates didn't help at all.The first thing I did before writing this review was to check those old problems.All gone, simply with a Turtle Beach install.Problem solved and with better sound! Can't beat it. Great card, great price. I love it.
0	horrible: Bought it one and half year ago from Circuit city. Used it mainly for general computer work, not gaming. When I upgraded to a newer machine and try to install it on it, has problem with driver on XP Media Center edition, can not record MIDI from my Yamaha keyboard, and they don't provide support for it any more. What kind of business is this vendor in? Only one and half year later, they don't provide any technical support for their products.
0	What a Shame: There is a lot of background music in this film that never made this collection. Unfortunetly it was also some of the best music from the movie. Why don't they put together "real" soundtracks that include all of the artists used? Instead they always give us their own watered-down choices. Bummer.
1	How can something so simple be so complexly beautiful?: When you play this CD, you will hear no human voices. You'll hear some background sounds of nature -- birds, crickets, the sound of water, the crackling of a fire, etc -- but the main feature is an unimaginably beautiful, masterfully played flute, and some soft percussion that I don't know how to describe. I strongly recommend this CD to anyone! I just played it yesterday after a gap of many years and I'm now kicking myself for having been away from it for so long. It's so beautiful and relaxing, perfect for anyone. There are only four tracks, but they are long, and it's easy to lose yourself into them.
0	Why did I waste my $$$$$?: There is only one good song on this whole album...don't waste your money unless you are super religious-then maybe you can relate to this music.
0	Buy another laminator: I thought this would be a cool laminator to have for my club. Boy was I wrong. My documents were wrinkly. I even ran the documents through a few times. The last time, it ate the carrier. The binder part wasn't very good either. You have to use special folders. I can't believe the manufacturer intended this for the office when it can't even support my little club's laminating needs. It goes to show a good looking product doesn't necessarily delivers.
0	Everybody Bombs Now And Then: Fans either love or hate this album. I fall into the later category for this is without doubt the worst Iggy Pop album, and quite probably one of the worst rock and roll albums ever recorded, bar none. The songs are unimaginative, the musicianship lacking and most amazing of all is that the production is completely incompetent, amazing considering super producer Don Was handles these chores. It surprizing that this didn't completely kill Iggy's recording career. A prime example is the cover of "Shaking All Over". The song shows potential then never takes flight, instead stalling and crashing big time. The Who never imagined the song this way, and with good reason. And its among the better efforts on the album. Try as I might, I just can't listen to more than a few minutes at a time. It is that bad.
1	Great science videos.: My children love these videos. Although they are just 7 and 9 years old, they learn something everytime they watch any of them - and so do I! These videos have a great way of presenting the amazing wonders of nature and God's handywork all around us. We purchased the19 DVD setMoody Science Classics:19-DVD Set, and it was well worth it!!!
0	rip off - crooks: Ordered this t-shirt for my son and Old Glory, the supplier, did not send the order and just relinguished the order with no explanation. WARNING..do not buy from Old Glory..it's a waiste of time, they will get your money and then a few months later refund with no explanation. Old Glory is keeping the money in the bank and getting interest for the few months till the refund.
0	Stream of Consciousness style detracts from value: Sorry to part company with the crowd here.THe author's thesis -- that "news" and ad media severely blur the distinction between Real and Unreal -- sounded intriguing, and I wanted to see how the author developed it. Unfortunately, after a few dozen pages, it seemed like the book was a good EXAMPLE of that thesis, and not an elucidation of it. It reminded me of James Joyce, and while Joyce's style can be wonderful for a novel, it kind of stinks for an expository work. My second thought is that publishers have got to stop paying people by the word.The author's point seemed reasonable and based on common-sense -- my quarrel was he could have made it more succinctly, with better support, and with less verbosity.Oh well, enough said.
1	worth watching from start to finish: saw this about 9 times on tvloved it more and more every timeshocking powerful action moviewith small bits of humorlike when Mason Storm gets down on his knees to look like he's playing fair with the robbers in the storeand he still kicks their ass regardless even while on his kneesnow that's funny and powerful. Lebrock is lusciously pretty and very talented. if you like Seagal see Marked for Death, Exit Wounds. and other great titles. I got this on dvd 2 days ago. it's worth the thrills, laughs and excitement every watchsee this movieif you like Kelly Lebrock, then see Weird Science. good and interesting movie
0	Ouch: This movie hurts me to watch it. Steven Segal gets shot up, put in a coma, and then he goes off killing people for revenge. The action is really cheesy, the plot is awful, and the one liners make you want to shoot Segal. Steven Segal can't act.Notice how his movies all seem to have three words "Above the Law" "Hard to Kill" "Straight to Video"....oops.There is a quote in this movie after Steven Segal shoots at a guy's crotch. "I missed. I never miss. They must be smaller than I thought." This line was a mess up, the correct line is: "I missed. I always miss. I must be lamer than I thought."If you wish to suck seven years off of your life, then go ahead, otehrwise steer clear.
0	The worst subtitles awards goes to...: I can't believe the other reviewers were reviewing the same dvd. This is a great movie, don't get me wrong. It's Kurasawa, after all. My one star is for the people at Mei Ah who put out this dvd. Whoever did the subtitle translation did not speak English well enough to graduate from a level one ESL class. The subtitles are truly terrible, sometimes bizarre, and I thought at times I was dreaming I was watching a Monty Python skit. Alas, I was not; this was for real. Such a shame.
1	Soap!: This dvd set is to complete my existing collection. It is one of the most enjoyable shows that I have ever watched! I recommend it to everyone.
1	Good book, but...: It is a very good book. I learned some interesting things, but I guess the subject is more deep. I found the book a little incomplete.
0	A fine game once - but it will not run on modern Macs: This is a PowerPC game. Up through Mac OS X10.6 (Snow Leopard), Intel Macs had "Rosetta," a technology for running PowerPC binaries on Intel machines.Apple discontinued Rosetta in Mac OS X10.7 (Lion), so there is not way to run this game (or any other PowerPC binaries) without emulating earlier versions of Mac OS X, or booting an earlier version on your Mac (which might not be possible with machines released after Lion). So do not buy it unless you are familiar with these issues.Caveat Emptor.
1	Portable Thoreau: I got this book within a timely manner and am very satisfied with the product and the seller.
0	Oh Please!: Not another one again! I just don't understand Mr Grisham's maniacal obssesion with juries. Who knows how many lawyer and jury books the guy has written? All I know is this: I'm sick and tired of reading about these dumb juries! The Runaway Jury was the only thing that was anywhere near decent that Grisham has poured from his stinking pen. Why does he think the average Joe is interested in judicial matters. I, for one, am not.
1	ALL ARISE! THE HONORABLE JUDGE GRISHAM IS BACK!: After SKIPPING CHRISTMAS and, most recently, BLEACHERS I had begun to believe that John Grisham had been abducted by aliens. But with THE LAST JUROR Grisham comes home to what he knows best: legal literature.THE LAST JUROR tells the story of a young newspaperman who scrapes his funds together, along with help from family to buy The Clanton Times his old paper when he was starting out in the world of journalism. Playing his cards right and reporting on the "dangerous" story of a brutal crime and the trial that ensues, the paper is off and running.But, when perpetrator of the crime is released from prison early and members of the jury start turning up dead, the people of small town Clanton are faced with the vengeance of the criminal and his family.Okay, the resolution of the story is predictable but THE LAST JUROR but the writing is vintage Grisham and marks his almost prodigal return to legal drama and that's certainly worth the wait.THE HORSEMAN
0	The Last Juror: I am a huge fan of John Grisham, have read all of his books, but I have to admit, I have been disappointed with his last few books and The Last Juror takes the cake in that department. It has a great plot, but Mr. Grisham goes no where with it. It starts off very strong, but half way through and all the way to the end, it is awful. I found myself skimming through the pages asking myself "what in the world does this have to do with the story?". Any Grisham fan out there should read it just to read it, but do not expect anything that Grisham's potential has to offer.
0	Very disappointing: Being a huge Grisham fan, I could not wait to read The Last Juror. That quickly turned to being unable to wait to finish it! The book began great, but quickly changed. It just seemed like it did not know where it was going...so many things, too many things were going on. I'd pass on this one.
0	boring: I took this book on vacation expecting a great read and it turned out to be a boring tedious read. If not for the Grisham name this book would not be on any best seller list. Reading this book was a chore not a pleasure. I finished the book and was still waiting for something to happen. Dont waste your time
0	WORST BOOK TO ME; OTHERS FIND IT BEST.: This is the worst book I've ever read because it was advertised as a THRILLER but there was zero suspense. It was such a boring book that it's a wonder that I even finished it. In contrast, I read the DA Vinci Code in 3 days because I simply couldn't put the book down.If the Last Juror had been advertised as a novel about a small Southern town, somewhat like To Kill A Mockingbird, I would have had a different mindset and probably would have enjoyed it more. I read Mockingbird in 3 days also.
0	If You Want to Read About Small Town Living: At first, The Last Juror held my interest like most of Grisham's books do. After the murder trial, which takes place very quickly, the book begins to sag. It becomes a diary of small-town living as seen through the eyes of city slicker Willie Traynor and doesn't pick up much again. What a disappointment.
0	Grisham's not so stunning "comeback": This having been his first legal thriller in a couple years, I was not completely impressed by the movement or character development in this book. I have read all of Grisham's books and would easily place this near the bottom of the list.The initial concept is interesting, but his storytelling was lackluster and characters a bit cliched.I kept thinking the "crime family" resembled the Clampetts and his protaganist was unbelievable at times. A lot of the characters were shallow, and the end was disappointing.If you are going to read this, wait for the paperback or get it from the library.Or just re-read the good ones: A Time to Kill, The Client, The Brethren and The Pelican Brief.
0	Fast reading, barely worth it: Several good court scenes are not enough to salvage this book, as Grisham stretches the plot needlessly through page after page. Actually, although this book is fast-enough reading, you can get through it even faster by checking out the plot summary on the dust jacket. It takes you up to page 291 (out of about 370). Even then, the ending is rather anticlimactic.Hard-core Grisham fans, wanting to preserve their record of reading everything he's written, will have a reason to read this book. The rest of us can surely find better ways to spend even the short time needed to read it.
0	But....!: Rarely have so many cliches about the South been found in one single place. The black lady with 7 children all with Ph.D.'s was too much for me! Her sexually adventurous 8th child was more believable.
0	The Man has lost it: I am still a big fan of Grisham's earlier books, especially Pelican Brief, but I think he's run out of ideas. The Last Juror is tired, boring, derivative and a waste of time.
0	What a disappointment!: John Grisham should stop churning out a book a year and focus on regaining the skills he had when he wrote A TIME TO KILL. Each "novel" has become progressively less satifying. I barely skimmed the last hundred pages of THE LAST JUROR.That's it for me with Grisham books.
0	The worst Grisham book out there!!!: I have read most, if not all, of Grishams books and this one was by far the worst!! I've actually stopped reading it about 3/4 the way through because i have ZERO interest in finishing it. It is very boring, has no suspense, and jumps around a lot. I kept waiting for something to happen and nothing ever did.
0	fast to slow page turner: I've enjoyed a few Grisham novels but this one fell mostly flat for this reader. I guess I prefer the fast paced legal action thrillers that he is known for. It started out great with a horrific murder and dramatic small-town trial but detoured quickly into a commentary of life in Mississippi in the 70's which made it a slow page turner for me.
1	A Character Study: The Last Juror seems to show Grisham's change as an author. In his early works he wrote suspense stories. In The Last Juror the suspense which is secondary to the development of wonderful characters. Miss Callie is a wonderful woman who shows how a powerful force for good can make her whole family better. It is worth reading this book just to meet her.The rest of the small town characters such as Harry Rex and Baggy as well as Will himself and his grandmother are wonderfully drawn.Some reviewers have commented that the book lacked suspense. It seems that Grisham is moving in his work. Rather than a fast moving book such as Angels and Demons with little character development, Grisham is now writing slower moving books with wonderful characters. The Testament and the King of Torts are examples. I think that the new Grisham is every bit as enjoyable as the early Grisham but just a little different.
1	A fun, fast read...: Not familiar with Grisham's work other than the fact that he seems suspiciously prolific, I wasn't expecting anything particularly special. Therefore, I was very plesantly surprised by how well written, compelling and seemingly personal this very entertaining story turned out to be.Great for that long plane ride or to take along on vacation, this smartly written story which says quite a bit about the author's sensitive impressions of the world around him, will keep you interested every chapter of the way.
0	ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ (What a snoozer): I read this book a while ago, but recently thought about it again when someone brought up bad books.I had never read a Grisham novel before this one, and I really expected so much more with all the hype his novels get. As it stands, I have not picked up a Grisham novel since reading this one. What a terrible book. Maybe I missed something, but there didn't seem to be any noteworthy plotlines to warrant writing a book about. I kept thinking, "When is all the action gonna happen? When is all the intrigue and suspense going to take place?" Well, here's the answer: NEVER.I made it all the way to the end of the book, only because I didn't want to think I'd wasted my time reading the earlier chapters. I was going to make it through the book even if it killed me -- but at least that would have been more action than was in the book!
0	Definitely not his best work: I found the storyline of this book to be very interesting, but it kept deviating away from the story and introduced way too many characters, that in my opinion, had little or nothing to do with the story. It's almost as if this was a short story stretched into novel length. Either that or the author was under a deadline to crank the next book out and this is the result. Still overall it wasn't terrible, but still not one of his best works, that's for certain.
0	This is the worst book he has ever written: This is the by far the worst book I have ever purchased. I would love to have my money back. What was John Grisham thinking about, when he wrote this? Obviously, he wasn't thinking. I have read everyone of his books, and if the rest of them are going to be like this, I will have to pass. I am an avid reader of John's; I am the one that can't wait until his next book comes out. I will have to wait next time, because I won't ever read another one like this!!!!!!!!!!!!
0	Grisham has lost his touch....: Drivel and more Drivel....Grisham has lost his touch. You can't write good suspense novels using Harlequin Romance Techniques, filling the pages with unsubstantial filler. If you liked "The Pelican Brief", and was unsatisfied with "The Bleachers", then you and I will agree on this one.
0	Last Juror: Nice book but not up to his previous work. Didn't bother to finish his work. Must have been in a hurry, under pressure from publisher. Would not recommend.
1	Can't Go Wrong!: I've been a DMB fan for quite a while now and have always loved their music, but hearing this CD just made me like the songs even more! I didn't really enjoy bluegrass before hearing this CD, but after hearing this album the only thing I can listen to is this Tribute! This is the best tribute I've ever heard! Every song is done in a way that adds more to the original version with every strum and pick! I would highly recommend this CD to anyone who enjoys Dave Matthews Band, or just bluegrass in general! If you don't believe me then listen to the samples! No matter how long you listen to this Breathe 2: Tribute to DMB you'll understand what I mean, and know that when you stop you'll be thiving for more! This song will become an addiction after you hear it! Do yourself a favor and buy Breathe 2! Trust me on this one, you won't be dissapointed!
1	great: this order came in really fast and it is a classic.. .... ... .. . . . .. ........... .............
0	It tries and tries...: Get a big cauldron. Next, drop in Blade Runner, Laura Croft and Krull. Mix haphazardly. Throw in pointless and gratuitous nude scenes, a pair of boots with six-inch heels and a weak plot. Simmer in a dank, dark place for two hours and you have the equivalent of 'Gene Generation'.While the idea behind the movie shows some minor promise, the constant sub-plots and generic fight scenes throw the whole film off center. Even the obvious physical talents of Bai Ling don't save this film, despite her best efforts. The special effects supporting the film's pseudo-science are ghastly (not in a good way); It looks like a ball of worms threw up on the actors.This is a B-movie, and a poor example to-boot. If not for the driving music score and the sheer beauty of Bai Ling, it wouldn't even rate that high. While not worth the $4 it cost on Amazon, it might be worth $1 on 'RedBox'; but they were too smart to include it in their lineup.
1	Excellent film!: This is what should be coming out of Hollywood now! This film from1973 is thought-provoking and truly entertaining without any silly special effects to blur the meaning!
0	OMG WHY DID WE EVER THINK THIS RAP WAS COOL?!: TIMOTHY BOTTOMS WAS SO CUTE IN1973 AND ALL THOSE SHOWER SCENES AND THE 2-3 SWIMMING POOL SCENES. AS OF AUG 2010 THIS MOVIE IS JUST A BIT OF NOSTALGIA, NOT WORTH THE1:51 LENGTH. SURE GLAD I RENTED VS PURCHASED. RECENTLY I TRIED TO WATCH THE :STRAWBERRY STATEMENT: AND IT WAS SO DATED AND LONG I HAD TO BAIL ON IT. WE WERE INNOCENT AND NAIVE TO BUY INTO THESE FILMS WHEN THEY WERE RELEASED. VERY PREDICTABLE AND FORMULAIC. IMAGINE US COOL KIDS BUYING INTO THE FLIMSY FILMS LIKE THE PAPER CHASE, LOVE STORY, ROMEO AND JULIET, AD NAUSEUM.
1	Call Home Mr. Hart and tell your Mother...........: Everytime I see this film, I get so glad that I dropped out of Law School. Kingfield is alive, well and lurking out there. If you are thinking about going to Law School, see this film if you have time between reading canned briefs. The "Little Questions that tumble in your brain are really there. The Stress over grades is real, the classmates who crash & burn are real. I can not recommend this film too highly to potential1Ls.
1	Yellow Cab Fever!: Jimmy Fallon is a cop who is such a bad driver he loses his license. Queen Latifah is a cab driver with a souped up Taxi who is a great driver. When Fallon comandeers Latifah's cab to stop a bank robbery, vehicular mayhem and fun break out! Add to the mix the fact the bank robbers are Brazillian Super Models and you have a surreal good time for all!Ignore the critics who have cut this movie to shreds. Its pure escapist fun that rates four stars. Enjoy!
0	ha ha jay!!! This film is crap: I have a friend called Jason o' Byrne and he loves this film... i just wanted to say...Jay this film is REALLY BAD!!!But the models are bleedin animal lookin!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1	Classic mystery, no major flaws: I think the serial killer plot has been done to death, but back when the Prime Suspect series started, it didn't seem tired.It was very enjoyable to see this program again, so long after it was on television. My only complaint is that it is a bit too long. I think the editing could be tighter. But the plot and the acting can't be faulted.As all the men on the detective squad are so "shocked" at a woman being put in charge of an investigation -- this aspect of the movie seems very dated now.Contrary to another reviewer, I found the DVD quality very good. This was made for TV and one cannot expect the same vivid image of a theatrical feature. Two dual-layer discs for a 210 minute program certainly provides sufficient data rate.Personally, I don't think this has good replay value, unless you intend to wait another ten years to watch it again. As such, the product seems overpriced to me. This is probably a better candidate for a rental.
1	Death at a Funeral: This Comedy is done as only the British can do them. When I first saw it in the Theater, I was not having a good day and didn't want to be there. I found my self laughing a lot. I enjoyed it so much we bought the DVD. We had some friends over and showed it. They loved it. If you are honest, you can recoginze characters from your own experience.
1	Funny Movie: One of the funniest movies I've ever seen. It gets funnier every time I watch it. That's why I purchased a copy for my movie collection.
0	Offbeat Humor: I suppose this type of humor isn't for me as I barely cracked a smile throughout the course of the entire movie. This movie presents you with uncomfortable situations and expects you to laugh nervously.

1	great plot twist: this is one of those movies that after you have watched it you go back and watch it again to see the clues to the ending and plot twist that you missed. i rented from the "redbox" for a buck so i was out nothing if it sucked. but it was a great movie so i bought it in blue ray. remember bruce willis in the sixth sense? it is much like passengers. i don't want to ruin it for you. just buy it, you will love it.
0	Painfully dull, poorly written rip-off *SPOILERS*: Fearless meets the Sixth Sense. Except that Fearless was excellent and the Sixth Sense was good. This movie is bad. Hathaway and Wilson have absolutely zero chemistry and all they do is blab on and on about nothing. The other characters walk in and out then disappear, only we hardly realize that since they're barely on screen for more than a minute at a time. By the time the end hits - all involved are greatly relieved that it's over. For everyone.
1	Ukrainian Tenor in later life: Many of these are from recordings made when this fabulous Ukrainian tenor was old. The Russians worked him well into his 90s. But what a voice. Even though these are from his later life, they are better than nothing. This voice is definitely one of a kind, with emotion so involving that it often draws tears to listeners' eyes. People who have only heard this recording of his voice should get earlier examples. As a younger man Kozlovsky sang with the most incredibly bel canto line squeezing every bit of meaning from the words. When I recently asked a very famous modern Russian baritone what he thought of Kozlovsky's voice, he said he did not like it. As a trained singer, I pressed him to explain further and he just muttered, "He sings in the old way." Whatever the old way is, I want it. It has passion and subtle nuances of feeling, quite different from some present-day singers' tendency to "bellow" while trying to demonstrate drama.
1	Learn CSS In Record Time: If you are new to CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) and want to get up to speed in no time, then Russ Weakley's 'Sams Teach Yourself CSS In10 Minutes' is the perfect guide to accomplishing that task!! In its simplest form, CSS is a way to quickly style web pages and be able to write HTML quickly and not have to worry about keeping track of fonts, colors, etc. while maintaining a uniform style all throughout your web site. If you need to learn how to use CSS quickly and efficiently, I highly recommend this great time from SAMS, you won't be disappointed!!Note: This book is for beginners only, any experienced CSS developer will want to go elsewhere as this book is only for newbies.***** HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
0	5 editors and a proofreader walk into a bar...: (The following comments pertain to the Sixth printing: June 2009 copy of the book)As noted by other reviewers, this version is riddled with numerous (and, in some cases, serious) errors that severely affect the overall worth of the book. In particular, Lesson19 "Positioning Two Columns with a Header and a Footer" is the victim of an almost complete lack of editing/proofreading. I challenge anyone to follow the directions in this section and come out on the other side with anything that looks like the example in the lesson. The first few chapters are serviceable; the rest is hit or miss from what I experienced. Too bad.
0	service engine light: This cap has caused my 'tighten gas cap' light to alert numerous times. I had a hard time making it fit so i'll not smell gas fumes when opening the driver side door after a trip. If you are buying this product for a 2004 silverado I would consider spending an extra 5 or10 bucks on a cap that wont give you mentioned problems.
0	I should have believed the other reviewers...: Even after reading the bad reviews this product received from other reviewers I still purchased it. It is pretty easy to set up, but once connected to my PC it had very inconsistent behavior.The device would lose connection to the server after a being idle for1-2 hours and require a reset.The video performance was awful with the included software. Tversity freeware media server made video performance better, but fast forward and rewind wouldn't work do to some video conversion routines being run by Tversity.Music files would play, and sounded good, but navigating through my music selection was nearly impossible because the music search feature doesn't work. Really... Doesn't work at all.I upgraded firmware and played all sorts of games to try and get the device to work. Finally I gave up and shipped it back to Amazon. The thing was just more trouble than it was worth.FYI: Amazon returns were great.
0	Too poppy: David Bowie seems to have gotten pulled into the candy-coated simplistic pop rock genre that dominates MTV and radios all over the US.His new album lacks the unique and artistic style of usual David Bowie. Too many generic drum and guitar tracks.Don't bother. If you're interested in buying anything, buy Space Oddity, the best album ever made.
1	Let it Open Up: The first listen, I'm betting that you won't get it. You probably won't even remember much except for the striking "Thursday's Child" (it has an awesome video too once you realise the theme). So give it a few listens and it will bloom. It's a fine finale to his "trilogy". Earthling is definately the peak of energy but as "Hours" now comes after, it chills you out in the reflective mood.Maybe not among his classics but very enjoyable and worth it.
0	bad: previous review was never printed. I will condense... This was trash. Too bad. I WAS a great bowie fan.
1	If I'm dreaming all my life....: What a comeback! OK, I know that Bowie never really disappeared from the scene, but he's been foundering for some time. This will hopefully signal th end of that period, as it is a really good recording. I'm not sure how many people will find all the metaphors in here, perhaps there aren't even supposed to be so many, but I just kept finding them. Added, many of the lyrics just fit my life right now, and the questions I find myself asking more and more--ie; "were we meant to last"? Were we? Whether we were or not, this CD should--at least, for a darned long time.
1	Loved it!: Reading through the table of contents of the book I had this sense of familiarity. The first few chapters have been titled and themed in such a way that it bring to mind the creation story found in the Bible. Granted, that's not what this book is about and I don't believe the story of creation found in the pages of Genesis is meant to be taken as literal scientific fact, however, I appreciate the sense of wonder and significance the framing gives to the beginning of time (even though, taken as is, it's not as if the beginning of our universe was lacking in wonder). Still, by borrowing a bit from the structure of the Genesis story, I think Ackroyd gives a bit of familiarity to the history and science he's sharing. Ackroyd weaves together science, a storytellers skill, easy page layout, and fascinating pictures and illustrations for a good overview of the very beginning of our planet to the final emergence of Homo sapiens.
1	K&N air filter: This product really allows my suzuki gsxr to breathe better - Its a great item and i will be sure to recommend you to other bike riding friends of mine.
1	good breather: its a different shape than the stock filter for my 82' xv750 but the holes line up fine and it fits well in my airbox,i definitely notice the increased performance from better airflow, and its reusable
1	A great filter that gave me extra power: I bought this for my Suzuki Boulevard C50 because I wanted a washable filter that lasted a long time. I heard people talking about how a K&N filter gave them extra power. I didn't really believe all that, but after I installed this filter on my bike, there was a small yet noticeable increase in power. I am happy! Extra performance on a washable filter that will last me for the life of the bike.
1	Good Purchase Experience: The filter was exactly as identifed when ordered. It was shipped promptly and packaged well enough to protect it during shipment.
1	Great price: 2010 Honda Goldwing very good price for a performance filter that can be washed and reused. Plus I believe that K&N filters flow more air.
1	Not great but is okay: All right, Adjust well on the bike, however I think the original has a best presentation and even better fit, I should clarify that there is nothing wrong with this device and it is too early to assess its performance, is currently installed and working well in general I have no complaints.
0	Didn't fit properly.: I purchased the K&N HA-6003 as a replacement for the stock filter in my 2003 Honda CBR600RR. The fit of the K&N was poor at best. I did manage to get it in, but not without considerable effort. Now that it's in the bike, I am a bit worried about it sealing properly. If I had it to do again, I would go with a different hi-flo aftermarket filter, or the OEM.
1	K&N's for every ride I own...: I always purchase K&N air filters for every vehicle I own, I didn't know that Amazon had the best price for them. I will definitely be using Amazon to purchase all my K&N stuff in the future.
0	Wouldn't work: The sharpener sat around for a month or so before I used it. When I went to use it, it didn't even have sufficient power to sharpen a pencil. Amazon wouldn't accept a return because I was out of the warranty period.
0	not heavy duty!: This sharpener is a joke. I have a small school and need to sharpen10-20 pencils a day. Bought this "heavy duty" model, however, it shuts off after sharpening 4-5 pencils! Don't waste your money, folks. I wish someone could steer me to a really heavy duty product.....
0	Don't Buy This!: Expensive as it is, I thought I'd have something that would give me no trouble. It eats pencils.The led gets broken and stuck in the machine, not allowing any further sharpening and you can't even take it apart and fix it.An unfortunate waste of time and money.JN
0	mediocre: In my opinion, no movie does any book justice. The book version is always better. This one is not a great remake of the book. I bought another version that was better. Would not highly recommend.
0	This is NOT the SHELL SEEKERS: This film bears only a passing resemblance to Rosamund Pilcher's THE SHELL SEEKERS. The director watered down the book's powerful plot to weak tea and you will barely recognize the characters. Angela Lansbury does her best but cannot help the tepid writing. The casting was almost completely off the mark - Danus is particularly badly cast. I expected a better film from the Hallmark Hall of Fame. This was so bad it took me 3 trys to get through to the end. Don't buy it. In fact, it's hardly worth renting. Reread the book instead.
0	quiet. then loud.: This recording takes the dynamics to the point where some passages are barely audible and you have to strain to hear them and then as you're straining and your ears are completely open and unprotected you get hit with the frying pan. It's like being abused with music. An anxiety inducing recording. Tried listening to it numerous times, now I'm either donating it to the library or perhaps simply throwing it as far away from my person as I can without damaging my rotator cuff.
0	delta sigma book: Hi,I bought this book sometime last month. Received it couple of weeks back. It was delivered promptly, but the book print quality seems to be bad. In fact it looks like a fake! Looks more like a photocopy of the original book. So much for paying this kind of money to buy the 'original'.
1	Fun to dance to: This collection of music is so cool. It gives you a quick glimpse of alot of different artists. It has nice catchy tunes all through the cd.
0	One of the Top Ten Worst Movies of All Time: I am still in shell-shock that people of quality such as Chloe Sevigny & Stephen Rea could even finish filming this piece of dog doo-doo, this thing is beyond horrid - there aren't enough words to convey how much this thing stunk! The movie starts out ok, steadily begins to make less & less sense, becomes just utterly non-sensical, and THEN takes a very sharp turn into pure absurd idiocy - and WAY over-the-top gore. NONE of it making any sense, mind you. NONE OF IT. Not the time structure of events, not the things taking place, and most assuredly not the moronic ending. I was quite angry that I'd spent $1.08 at my discount video to even rent it.
0	Poorly Done!: Fist of that version of the national anthem was the pitts!I mean all of those train and carrying on was ridiculous! First off no one will and ever sing the National Anthem like Whitney Houston! Beyonce did an alright job! People are making that up to be something its not!Thank You for your time and consideration!!Sincerly Yours,A Music Major at Florida Stae University!
1	Short stories for philosophers, literature snobs, and lovers of the unusual: Albert Camus, born in Algeria in1913, won the Nobel Prize in Literature in1957 and died three years later, but his writings live on. This collection of six unusual, strange-endinged stories will probably be of interest to a wide range of short story fans. Sometimes seemingly vague and symbolic (and with odd titles and endings), they are thoroughly enjoyable and readable. Though similar in complexity, subject matter and settings vary greatly: a woman joins her fabric-selling husband on a business trip, a detongued former missionary awaits his replacement, barrel makers strike, a prisoner is foisted on a schoolmaster, an artist works amidst ever-changing chaos, and an engineer visits inhabitants near the site of a future dam. Exile and the Kingdom is an excellent, strange, brief book. Other strange short stories: Blind Willow, Sleeping Woman by Haruki Murakami.
0	Can you say cardboard with cheese flavor: Like the other Doctor Kracker Snack I reviewed they are as hard as a rock. Reminds me of pasteboard with cheese flavoring.
1	Personal and universal: If you love Paul Williams and if you love Dylan this is an unbeatable experience, focusing as it does on what some might call "lost years" of highs and lows of Bob's career. It is all the same for Paul Williams who takes it ALL in and lovingly dissects every speck of Dylan's output. Paul Williams was a lone voice in the wilderness back in the "Dylan: What Happened" days so this serves as an extension of that important book.
0	Drew Barrymore has made her "opps!" movie once again: Drew Barrymore has been having a hard time making good movies after making the the movie "Ever After" which i thought was a OKAY movie,which i gave **.but home fries was a horrible movie with a messed up script and plot.plus i thought it was too dark to be a comedy.*
0	BORING!! But barley okey: This is the dulliest unsatisfiting of all time . Even though Drew Barrymore is in it . It still doesn't steal the show . The middle was okey but the rest was just plain Garbage .
0	Home Fired!: It is a very good thing that Drew Barrymore did not choose this film to kick start her career. This film was a bomb from the word go. It was overly campy and completely unbelieveable. While the premise of the story is somewhat interesting, the depiction is absolute blah! Do yourself a favor, if you must see this film ... RENT IT FIRST!
1	Best TV Series EVER EVER EVER EVER EVER: As the cover said, this is the TV series that still stands as the benchmark for others. Knock-out performances by the incomparable Laurence Olivier, Jeremy Irons and last but not least in my opnion the best character ever put down on film: Sebastian by Anthony Andrews.Well, all will know this story about romantic yearning, friendship, loss and mostly the English charm of it.In a concluding scene with Charles Ryder he was told by an old studentfriend that that charm (of Sebastian) was dangerous, and that it almost took the best of him.And that might be true in a general sense: once seen it is hard to come to terms with it, first that this series is finite, and second the tragic fate of indeed the most charming person on screen yet, Sebastian, that sort of friend that we are all looking for, but who is so hard to find!
1	Great Art based on Great Art: This production need not be limited to "ever made for TV." This is one of the greatest and most profound movies ever made. Every element of every scene is superb and riveting. I watched it again, twenty years after first seeing it, and enjoyed it even more with my Southern Baptist wife who kept insisting "let's watch just one more episode"!This story is esentially Catholicism talking to itself through both the main characters and the sheer majesty of the Brideshead Estate (Castle Howard). This work is epically and evengelically Catholic. Anyone who sees "Brideshead Revisited" will find his tongue stopped about pedophile priests and "Hitler's pope" because his mind has been slowly, platonically wrestled around to see the glory of God's church on earth. Waugh is a midwife first, author second; and I would say the same of Mortimer, who made this production happen. Thank God for both men and for this production.
1	it doesn't ever get better than this...: they show this on PBS sometimes so even if you choose not to purchase the best drama ever to grace the 21 inch screen you can still see it. it is so far above anything else to first appear on television you may wonder how it ever was produced! perhaps that is a story in of itself. in any case it is truly one of a kind and to not see it would be like never seeing Dr. Zhivago or Casablanca or any of the other larger than life tragic love stories of this century.
0	Brides head revisited: This product was ompossible to watch the sequence of episodes was all mixed upFor example episode 9 was only able to be played by pressing episode11 and so on.When there were three episodes on a disc the middle episode would not respondAnd could not be played.I was amazed to receive such an inferior product from amazon.
0	Blu-Ray version washed out and colorless: This is one of my favorite tv shows of all time, but I have never been so disappointed in any product as I was with this one. Don't bother buying the Blu-Ray version. It has been remastered in some way for high definition that results in a flat, colorless picture that is overly bright and has little detail. (I had the same problem with the new version of Upstairs-Downstairs, also by Acorn Media.) I watched about fifteen minutes of it before I gave up and got out the DVD version and watched it on my up-converting DVD player. With the DVD version, the picture is a little blurry, but at least there is color and detail, and the picture is not flat. If you already have it on DVD, leave well enough alone. If you don't have it at all don't buy the Blu-Ray version, invest in a $50 up-converting DVD player instead.
1	As wonderful as I remembered it!: Can't go wrong with the content. Amazing acting, photography, storyline. Only complaint is a couple of minutes of slightly blurry picture on one of the discs. So glad to own this for my viewing whenever I want.
0	Bird is always bird: Its ok for a single DVD. However, if you are looking for an extended documentary on his life, buy the big 4 or 5 DVD volume by Ken Burns, there's nothing like it, and it spends quite a lot of time on Bird. Its a must-have for jazz fans.
0	Beware of Seller: I ordered this book mid-April for Mother's Day. It did not arrive at the estimated time. I waited another week then contacted the dealer. They said I needed to wait the maximum shipping time before they could resolve the issue. It still did not arrive so I contacted them again and they stated that they would send the book now. I waited again and it still didn't arrive so I sent another email. Amazon has issued a refund because the seller now says that the book is apparently out of stock. I feel they should have said that from the beginning.
1	A good starter book to help focus on WWII books of interest: I really liked this book. I use it to further add books to my Wishlist. Dunnigan's mini-summaries of included books are loaded with details. I have several books by Dunnigan all of which I have enjoyed reading. Some other reviewers have provided less than glowing reviews of some of his books. I try to keep things in perspective so flaws noted are not ignored. Given his background and experiences, I suspect James Dunnigan might be a very interesting author to meet in person.
1	Schiller: This is the second edition of this book. The Translator spent years on researching and putting Schiller's works together. He worked closely with the Germans to make sure that he got this right. However, the second edition has the Translator's very own poem; The Translators Apology To The Reader as he had to make some corrections in his own translating. Schiller was a controversy of sorts in his time. Many of his poetry has to do with his one love Laura, the lady who first captured his heart, and had great impact on his life.
0	What a disappointment...: I agree wholeheartedly with the first reviewer- what is the point of this boxed set? I have YesYears as well, and almost every other Yes cd. This boxed set adds very little that is new, and might only be worth buying for someone without any Yes cd's, or who is new to listening to the band. Other boxed sets (Jethro Tull, Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen, Eric Clapton, etc.) were done very well by their respective record companies, and make a lot of sense.The one good thing about this box set is that (supposedly) all the music was remastered. If Rhino goes back and re-releases some of Yes's albums with bonus tracks (as they are doing for the band Chicago), I would definitely be interested in buying that.
1	YesYore: Judicious choice of tracks by Steve Howe makes a seemingly inessential purchase (how many best-of's/repackagings from the band in recent years?) hard to pass up. Disdaining the live tracks, solo meanderings (The Fish?), and subpar B-sides that afflicted Yesyears, this 6-hour package sounds and looks great. Nothing (incl. America) is abridged, and liner notes make a strong case for Yes rivaling King Crimson as musical pioneers. Packaging, as always with Rhino, is exemplary.
0	NOT ORIGINAL ARTISTS: This is NOT a compilation of Original Releases. It is a DEMO of publishing co. Soundtracks.
1	Barbara Crampton looks great in leather!: Great horror movie! Jeffrey Combs does very well in this one
0	I'm unhappy !!!!: I didn't receive this item. I live in Brazil and I asked to a friend of mine, who was in the United States, to bring it to me. The package was sealed, but the blades were not inside.
1	Fantastic but: The design of this basketball system is fantastic. It is so easy to move and so easy to raise or lower the backboard. It is sturdier than most movable systems and with the 4 wheels and the leaver action you can easily move it from one place to the other without emptying the reservoir. If it is a windy day you can easily lower the back board. Now that I have raved about the product let me give you the negative, if you are not mechanically inclined, do not even attempt to put this together. The directions are terrible and there are a lot of moving parts. After putting it together there are a lot of left over nuts and bolts and you wonder what you have forgotten, but the directions are very bad so you had to guess at what they meant. So I recommend that you hire someone to put this together which is what we had to do to get this put up. Took the person many hours to get it together and he was not working by an hourly rate.
1	Pure magic: Morgan LLywelyn is one the most gifted writers writing today and "Lion of Ireland" is her masterpiece. You feel her passion and the love she has for the Irish in her words and her unique storytelling talent makes this book one of the best books I have ever read.
1	A truly magical book: This book is a master piece. This was the best book I ever read and I should know I'm only13 but I've read more than my share of books. This should be turned into a movie, Brian of Boruma makes William Wallace look like a child. And if they're lookin for somebody to have a small part like Turlough I'll gladly play the part.
0	Trite and predictable: I was excited to read this book based on the reviews, my love of history. I was extremely disappointed. The characters here are one dimensional, uttering predictable catch-phrases, and are basically uninteresting. I got through about 200 pages and couldn't even finish. The main character is increadibly driven, and consequently his reactions throughout the story become entirely predictable. He has no depth and the author doesn't create any kind of sympathy, empathy, or interest between the character and the reader. I really didn't care what happened to him or any of the characters in the book. I think I'll stick with Bernard Cornwell, or Sharon Kay Penman.
0	A big disappointment: I disagree with the reviewer who characterized the author as a poor writer. She isn't. The problem is the content. After reading the first 90 pages, I put the book down, finally admitting to myself that I really didn't care what Ms. Powell thought or opined about anything. I was finding her blog-turned-book to be just one more rant from a neurotic New Yorker, a genre for which my tolerance peaked several years ago. It was never that high to begin with.Unfortunately, a friend had given me the book, thinking I'd enjoy it because of my fondness for Julia Child. Maybe that contributed to my reaction to the author. Juxtaposing herself with Julia Child invites one to think about issues of character, style and substance. On all those measures, Ms. Powell suffers.My recommendation: see the movie, but forget the book.
0	Catastrophic Hissy Fit: How do you take an idea with so much promise and turn it into an excruciating read? You allow someone like Julie Powell to write about it, that's how. Never in my entire life have I found the narrator of a book more irritating than I did Powell. More a filthy-mouthed diatribe of her whiney ways than the entertaining cookalogue it should have been, had Julia Child lived to read "Julie & Julia," undoubtedly she would have deemed it just as disrespectful and non-serious as she did Julie and her "project." I wanted to like this book; I really did. In the end, however, it's nothing more than something Powell claims to have regularly on subway platforms: a catastrophic hissy fit. One can only hope the movie fares better, but then again, it could hardly do worse. Two stars for managing to steer unlikeability and awful writing to the top of the bestseller chart. Kudos for that amazing feat at least.
0	POLITICAL ONLY: WHY DID SHE FEEL THE NEED TO KNOCK REPUBLICANS AT EVERY TURN? A REAL SIGN OF LOW INTELLIGENCE. SPOILED BOOK COMPLETELY. SHE IS VERY OPINIONATED IN ALL HER THOUGHTS AND FILTHY TALK TO BOOT...THINKS SHE IS SOPHISTICATED...BAH.BAD BOOK.
0	Terrible: I found this book to be simply unreadable. Too much trite dialogue and a very unlikable, whiny author. I muddled through to page 87 and had to put it down. If you're interested in Julia Child, I highly recommend My Life in France by Julia Child--excellent!
0	A Rambling Mess: I picked this book up with an expectation of a fun memoir read. The premise was unique...cooking all 524 recipes from Julia Child's Art of French Cooking. I expected a fun romp of cooking mishaps, triumphant cuisines, interesting tales of kitchen disasters and enjoyments but instead it was nothing but a misguided attempt at a so-called memoir. Very, very disappointing.
0	Movie better than the book: I have to say for the first time in my life the movie is way better than the book, it is totally disjointed and full of unnecesary profanity. The author comes across as very immature and a total whiner. Don't bother buying it, the movie is much more enjoyable.
0	Stay as a Blogger: This is a terrible book. Julie Powell is, on her own admission, not a good cook and the text proves it. And on the evidence of this book she is not a good writer either. I am accustomed to swearing (it is generally a substitute for vocabulary), but the use of foul language throughout is distasteful. Perhaps her moment of fame will inspire her. I doubt it. She should stick to blogging. Poor Julia - passe she may be, but she must be turning in her grave at this travesty.
0	Profanity detracts from material: I can count on one hand the books I have thrown away in my lifetime of 47 years. I treasure books and respect them, but unfortunately this one had to be kept away from anyone else. I didn't get past the first ten pages. The level of profanity was so distracting that I couldn't focus on what the author was saying. Her writing is rich, and I appreciate that. But the book is now smoldering in our burn barrel outside.
0	too much julie not enough julia: The politics gets really old really fast as do the day to day lives of the self absorbed and rather dull cast of characters. I really wanted to like the book, but, like a number of other reviewers, I could only make it part way through. PS. enough with the F-word already. It may be hip, but it's jarring especailly when used incessently.
0	Don't Buy This Just Because You Liked the Blog: I read the Julie/Julia Project blog occasionally and enjoyed it. I thought that the book would be similar, but it wasn't. I don't object to irreverent opinions and random stories in a foodie memoir, but she took out too much of what made the blog fun and what she replaced it with lacks wit and charm. Powell's writing feels forced and her contrived expositions of how hip, liberal, and shocking she is/wants to be pall quickly.
0	I did not like this book: After reading some of the reviews I see that there seem to be two sets of camps regarding this book: folks either loved it or hated it. I guess I'll have hang out with the haters. Julie Powell comes off as an extremely unpleasant, immature little princess. It's a good idea: a year cooking from Julia Child's French cooking book but it's just so hard to read. The whole thing is snark and whine and it tiresome after a few chapters.
0	Don't waste your time or money on this awful book!: Very poorly written book. It's all over the place. The "f" word seemed to be thrown in simply to fill space. At times I didn't have the slightest clue what she was talking about. She tried to be funny - and failed miserably. And besides being boring and poorly written she frequently takes cheap shots at republicans, which were just distracting and irritating.Simply put this book is nothing like I was expecting and I am so glad that I got a copy from the library and didn't contribute one dime to this woman's bank account. I returned it to the library the very next day - unfinished.Very disppointing, this was such a good idea for a book and a movie, but Julie Powell just wasn't up to the task...at least not to my standards.
0	I tried: I wanted to like this book. I've curled up with it a couple times now, thinking that I was just being difficult and should give it another chance. I absolutely love Laurie Colwin's writing, surely I should enjoy this. But I just didn't. I can't explain why sometimes cranky writing is warm and endearing and sometimes it isn't, but something is lacking in this book. And while it's true that she tracks down such things as bone marrow and squab for authenticity's sake, she misses another recipe's texture completely because she doesn't have a cooking thermometer. Surely every grocery store with even a handful of implements for sale offers a cooking thermometer (probably for less than the cost of a squab)?
0	Narcissistic Hipsters Should Cook, Not Write: After seeing the movie, I knew what I was in for when I read the book. Julia Child is a survivor, a truly original pioneer of the old school, disciplined and humble. She is everything that hipster bloggers, like the author, is not - whiny, narcissistic, entitled, yet full of illusions of her own grandeur and hero-worshipping of everything "vintage" and iconic - in this case it's Julia Child. I wasn't surprised Child responded the way she did - who would want to be used as a marketing gimmick and turned into a cultural totem object by a wimpy, girl-woman who has the life experience of an ameoba? Julia Child must have sensed this and stayed away.
0	disappointing: I love both cooking and reading blogs, so I thought this book would be a natural fit for me. Unfortunately, I didn't enjoy much about it. The writing is so-so, and the author's "deep thoughts" that come from her cooking experiences are pretty banal and predictable.I did get a laugh that there are book club questions included at the end - I can't imagine that any book club would select this book - there is just not a lot of substance here. I'd give this one a miss.
0	Just OK: The character was self-absorbed past distraction. In fact, she was so distracted that most of the time she could not get out of her own way. And where was she going? And why do I want to read about it? I also found it difficult relating Julia Child's "diary" excerpts to the life-experiences of Julie that they were spliced into. If it wasn't a book club book, I wouldn't have finished it.
0	Horrible Recipes Made Bearable: As I'm more than halfway through this book I might as well finish. Julie's less than amusing encounters with lobster slaughter, for example, are rendered with just enough humor to make her tales palatable. I'd forgotten how unbelievably disgusting a great many of Julia's Child's recipes were until slogging my way through the diary version of Julie's life with Julia from hoof to flailing claw to beaten lettuce. A slight exaggeration, but not by much.Proof that the human species hasn't advanced all that far on a culinary level, if we're supposed to be amused by all this.
0	Don't waste your money: Please don't waste your time or money purchasing this book. Our book club decided to read it based on it's "good" reviews. Only one person out of six finished it (just to get it done). The language is foul and the story is boring and drags on, which makes it difficult to follow and finish. Two stars is being generous.
0	Ick, Ick, Ick: My book club is reading this book. A friend loved it and said it was a quick easy read. I hate it, hate it, hate it and have from the first few pages. The main character is boring, profane (for no apparent reason except lack of class) and whines about everything. The only thing I've enjoyed is the tiny bit about Austin, where I grew up. I adored Julia Child who was one of a kind. The author should be ashamed using her singular greatness to make money with this crass garbage.
0	I bought this for a laugh...: This is just hilarious. Mary-Kate and Ashley releasing their Greatest Hits 3 album- what could be funnier?! I don't really know whether to give this one star for musical ability, or 5 stars for comedy. I guess I'll just go with one star...If you want to laugh, but this album.
1	Must Have for Newborns: This was by far our most useful baby gift-- it helped our baby get to sleep and even saved our sanity a few times. Nothing calms a crying newborn better than a good swaddler. At first it's a little tricky to figure out how the velcro fits together, but once you've tried it a few times, it's easy. Just buy 2 or 3 so you won't go into a panic when it's in the wash.
0	Simply put - does not work: I read Dr. Karp's book and decided to buy a swaddling blanket. After doing a lot of research and reading a ton of good reviews on this one, I decided not to spend the $30+shipping on the miracle blanket, but get this instead. Boy, was that a bad decision. We tried a few times, and my baby unswaddled herself within seconds! Granted, we had a big and healthy baby, who was strong, so maybe if your baby is tiny and/or weaker than an average newborn for whatever reason, it might work nicely for a while, but otherwise, don't waste your time with this. I ended up buying the miracle blanket, and that WORKED! Do yourself a favor, spend the extra $20 and buy the miracle blanket. I could have avoided many sleepless nights if I did that earlier!
0	Not for Baby Houdinis!: I was reluctant to invest in a blanket specifically for swaddling, but after a few weeks of making due with regular blankets, I tried the SwaddleMe wrap. While it is reasonably priced, cute and easy to use, my little guy found it easy to "escape", both from the size-appropriate blanket, and from the smaller size. I just couldn't keep his arms secure or tightly wrapped. Swaddling at night makes all the difference for my baby, so I'll continue to do it, but I'm back to my low-tech system: receiving blanket and tape.
0	worse than a straight jacket: My baby hates this even though he loves being swaddled. Definitely the worst baby product I've purchased.
1	helps baby sleep better!: very nice. easy to use. highly recommended. baby always seemed to manage to escape his blankets- this he can not get out of :)
0	Too big: Blanket was too big in the large size for 21 inch baby at 9 lbs. They have 2 sizes but no chart to figure out which size you need. The velcro tabs are small and she could easily slip out. I'm waiting until the baby is bigger to use it, but we're in the third month and still waiting. Other reviews have said the small was too small, so I'm not sure. Would recommend Miracle Blanket; costs more but is one-size fits all and is adjustable as they grow. Just don't put it in the dryer...
0	Ok, but there are better swaddlers: I have used the small and large size of these swaddlers and wouldn't waste my money again. I have to wrap my son so tight for these to work, that I won't be using them anymore. Too many nights he wakes because his hands escape. It's not worth the disrupted sleep. I liked that these were more affordable than the other "miracle" brand, but ended up wasting more money because these didn't work for me. Other swaddling blankets, such as the "miracle" blanket do not solely rely on wrapping tight, but also have other tucking aspects that make it effective. If you have a Houdini baby, don't waste your money.
0	Keep it tight!: Make sure its as tight as possible, otherwise the babies head can get inside and the baby could soffocate. The back/side should be totally covered in velcro so that you can stick the tabs where you need them
1	nice gift: This is a very uplifting mix of Christmas music. If you like Celtic music, then you will appreciate the various tunes.
1	SMALLER than what it says on the prod description.: The product came promptly and I like it. It was way cheaper than any of the big hardware chains and even one huge lumber and hardware store that caters to contractors. Item has good weight on it so it does not feel or look cheap. One thing I DID NOT like was that it was SMALLER than what the product description states. This is1 inch in diameter NOT11/4 inches. Other than that I am happy with it.
1	oil rubbed door knobs: perfect size and color to replace the chrome ones when we did the redecorating in our bathroom -- lots of browns, copper and rust colors .... perfect!
1	look nice: they do look like the could cost you alot more but the quality really shows after time... the finish does remove from the knob over time but for me it wasnt a big deal since it was for a basement... but if you need if for a upscale kitchen i would pass but for a back room or an old drawer its perfect
0	Never arrived: I ordered this so I could watch it for a paper. Too bad it never arrived and I had to scramble at last minute to find a copy.
0	Made in China; that says it all!: Dont' bother with these rotors! They warped after barely 300 miles. I was assured by PowerStop that their products were NOT from China, yet after peeling off a label on the box, it was clearly marked, "Made in China". So either these are NOT really from PowerStop, or I was lied to.
0	N.G. For TIVO: I agree with other users.... If you read the TIVO recommended wireless network adapters, this adapter will not work in TIVO because AMAZON is going to ship you out V.2. V.2 does not work, and V.1 is not longer made. I suggest you just order the TIVO brand.... that's what I did, after trying numerous others.and YES, I have a brand new unit with the latest software, that's NOT the issue.
0	i dont know if it works...: worked but a weird deal, not sure if my computer was the problem or this thing....i cant say it is bad or good sorry...
0	Doesn't work and very frustrating: It worked at first but the connection kept dropping. Then every time you try to open the wizard it flashes on the screen for a second and disappears. You can't get the wizard to stay on screen for more than a second so can't change any settings. A total waste of time and money - don't bother with it.
0	Doesn't work and merchant won't allow returns: This product is horrible. We own a Belkin and it works, unlike this wireless adapter. I thought I'd try this one since it's smaller and a bit less money, but it doesn't doesn't pick up any signal from our modem, and the modem is across the hall in the next room. In addition, I bought it from State Street Deals, and they won't let us return it because it's been opened. How else would we find out it doesn't work? Definitely NOT a great product, or merchant. I'd avoid both at any cost.
0	Wow! What a piece of junk!: I just spent hours of frustration trying to get this thing to work reliably. Never got it working correctly. Netgear won't just let you install the drivers and be done with it. No, they force you to install their bloated and buggy configuration software which doesn't play well with Windows XP(apparently). So, after much cursing and hair-pulling, I took it back and exchanged it for a comparable Linksys adapter. Now all is right again in my universe. If you are looking for a USB wireless adapter, do yourself a favor and go back to the search page and type in L-i-n-k-s-y-s.
0	Don't waste your money!: Although I am very happy with the other NetGear products I own I have to say that this adapter is a waste of money. It's easy to set up (I'm running Windows 2000) and starts working at first, but after less than a half hour, it flickers out and stops working entirely.I have a NetGear router and laptops using NetGear PCI wireless cards which work well, but this product is a dog. I second one of the earlier reviewers who mentioned how hot the item gets after a short time in use. My guess is that it has a design flaw that causes it to overheat and stop working. They should really go back to the drawing board on this one.
1	Delicious: Our Shiba Inu, Maya, loves these. First and foremost, the packaging says Made in the USA and that makes them worth buying right there. They are quite light and airy (being freeze dried) and are easy to crunch or gum for older dogs. A definite go to treat for any canine companion.
1	We all love this!: This is an excellent treat for my cats, all natural with only one ingredient. I use this to bribe them into letting me brush their teeth. It might be pricey, but a little goes a long way.
0	No Mre sequals!: This movie did not fill it's axpectations, it was horible! I'd like to see the producers come up with another one, how in a million years would peter survive if EVERYONE knows it's him?, He doesn't have to be a perfect gentlemen but taking off his mask to everyone he meets, the whole movie was moronic I would of enjoyed it if that weird gravity thing erased people's memory and, that Auto guy could control his arms after all he wasn't even evil!
0	Big Fat Letdown: After the amazing Spider-man, which was full of action, adventure, and intrigue, Spider-Man 2 falls flat. The commercial and ads make it look like it's another Spider-Man, but be warned, it's not. The action scenes you see in the commercials are the only scenes with anything interesting shown in them, and most of the movie is just Peter Parker sitting in his aunt's house drinking tea, and/or hanging out with Mary Jane, who has a more boring character than she did in the first one. This movie has the audacity to call itself an action movie, but it is more of a teen angst drama, with one or two scenes of action. In fact, I do not see why this movie got a PG-13 rating for violence. It's closer to a G. This movie is a BIG letdown after the first one, and it will not be on anyone's future list of favorites (or at least, I hope not).
0	I wanted to like it I really did!: I thought it was slow and predictable. Tobey was good as Spiderman but his character seemed a bit whiny and was too much of an idiot. I don't get it why everyone likes Spiderman so much it's not that good of a movie. I didn't like the first one much either both Spiderman movies suck and I hope the 3rd one will be better but it will probably be the same as the first two. It's in my opinion if I didn't like it don't get mad why I didn't like it I just didn't like it.
1	Spiderman 2: Grade A+: This film is quite possibly the best film sequel ever made. It outshines the 2001 original. The action, special effects, acting, story, and the villain are all improved. The action is this film is heart pumping, non stop, and fun to watch. The special effects have greatly improved over the past three years, especially in the aerial shots of New York City. The acting in the film is better especially in Mary Jane's character. The story is definately improved, due to the emphasis on Harry Osborne's hate of Spiderman, and Peter Parker having to juggle his life around being a superhero. Another great aspect of this film is the new villain, Doc. Oc. This villain you can hate and sympathize with unlike the totally sinister green goblin. The film's ending sets up perfectly for a third installment to this wonderful film series that will last for generations.
1	Great movie!: I thought it was a great movie. Personally i think it's the best out of the three out today.
0	Marketing really does work.: I can understand just wanting to watch a trashy action film but this movie was just annoying. Tobey Maguire did his best to convince us that he really is a wet noodle. His snivelling self-conflicted, let-me-show-you-my-feminine-side routine was a bit overplayed. For a minute I thought that it was the exact character that he played in Cider House. Somehow I couldn't help imagining Roger Ebert with a toothy grin, ramming popcorn in his mush while fawning over Maguire's touching portrayal of a superhero in conflict. Seriously, this was a casting disaster that the marketing department saved. A few reviews ago somebody mentioned "not seeing enough of maquire's body." Was that a joke? After seeing him in this film I am ready to concede that there is a place for steroid use in this world. Reading these reviews I'm suspecting that the production company is paying people to write reviews on amazon.
0	smallville anyone?: I must admit the sequel is bucketloads better than the first. That said, the rest sucks. Spiderman is a total copy cat of Superman and Smallville. The villians and the characters are total ripoffs. Money wasted. Do yourself a favor and watch a better movie. Make it Superman.
1	Spider 2 Strikes Gold!: This movie has an excellent story (better than the first). First rate acting, direction, and special effects. In my estimation, this is better than the first!
0	Don't listen to the other reviewers it sucked!: I did not like Spiderman 2 at all (...)! It was like watching a soap opera movie or something with no action in it. All there is, is just graphics there's not any fighting in it. Doc Ock wasn't a villian at all he was just tryin to go after Spiderman for what he did to him and all. I don't really see Tobey Maguire as Spiderman that much he just wasn't right at all. Kirsten Dunst was allright as MJ and she's georgeous. I wouldn't mind having a girl like that. James Franco would have been a better Spiderman than Tobey Maguire. Why did they had to choose Tobey? I hate Tobey Maguire and all of his movies they suck and he's also boring who never says a word. But anyways don't waste your money on this movie it's very bad. That goes along with the first Spiderman. Both Spiderman movies suck!
1	Very awesome<3: its full of action, adventure and some romance and though i dont like spiders, the spider man is kick ass<3
0	Awful - Nearly Painful: I liked the first movie. It was generally Hollywood fluff, but was interesting enough that I could suspend my disbelief to the point I found it enjoying. An acquaintance of mine recently raved about the sequel and between that and the reviews here I was very anxious to see it when my colleague mentioned she had just bought it. Imagine my surprise when I caught myself watching the clock, rolling my eyes and eventually contemplating shutting off the machine during several points in the film.Kirsten Dunst lost whatever acting ability she had shortly after Interview with a Vampire. She doesn't seem to have the range or depth to portray the complexities of the relationship between M.J. and Parker. Macguire, I guess, plays a sadsack to a tee - but I don't think I've ever seen him play anything else.The one redeeming part of the entire movie is the fight scenes, while completely unbelievable - the effects are flawless.
0	Not that Good: The first Spiderman was way better than this garbage. the acting was horrible and the action scenes... well there were hardly any action scenes. This movie sucked there was way too much talking. Doc Oc was horrible he wasn't even mean. don't waste your money.
1	good, but the first was better: Spiderman was good, but I liked the first spiderman movie a lot more. This one was too much of Peter Parker not having his powers, and doing stupid stuff. For example, why did he keep on taking off his mask. The time on the train was understandable because spiderman could not see, but the rest of the times were just stupid choices for people to know spidermans identity. Also, why did spiderman keep on losing his powers. Shouldn't he still have his powers even if he didn't want to be spiderman. When Peter parker got bit by the spider in the first place, he didn't want powers, but he had them anyway. Now why is he losing them?The first one was better, but see this one anyway.
1	Better than the first: Remarkably entertaining movie. I still get chills watching the action sequences on my 27" Television.
1	Great price!: My daughter loves all the Spiderman movies and I bought her one through three for Christmas... can't beat the price!
1	best hdmi player: best picture quality excellent sound and very good aesthetics .price is very low .easy to convert to all region
1	Build Better Than Expected: Great product at great price (69.99 with free delivery). I recently purchased a panasonice upconverting dvd player and although the video, remote on that player is great the build quality is sub par compared to this player. glad to have this dvd player after having great experience with pioneer laser disc back in the day. usb input a huge plus. Great video. Don't hesitate.
0	Would be great if I could watch it: Never mentioned in the description that this was a PAL video from another region than the USA. An omission that means a lot. I was at this show, have seen clips, and was looking forward to seeing the entire thing now,11 years later. Be forwarned - if you get this and live in America and do not own a multi-region player you will be out of luck.
1	Wilbur Smith at his best: I bought my first Wilbur Smith book Nov'86. It was translated to Swedish. At that time (being 22 years old) I hadn't yet started to read in english on a regular basis. Out of curiosity I counted the books from this author that I had bought over the years, and I found to my surprise that I had19 different novels. I like all of them. If you purchase 'Birds of Prey' it is a good introduction to also buy other novels from the same author. Just a warning; dont pick it up and start to read unless you know that you have some time to spare. This book will not let you do other things for a while. All of his books are entertaining, highly interesting and yet educational at the same time. The perfect companion to bring when you want to have a quiet moment on your own and relax with a good book.
1	Excellent reading, but not perfect: Well I have read most of Wilburs books (at least those on market for the past10 years) and this is another good one, even though it seems that towards the end Wilbur just wanted to finnish the book quickly, the details of the first scenes are just not there towards the end. As I said it seems like he got bored and just wanted to finnish
0	A trashy, macho bodice-ripper for guys.: When I started reading Birds of Prey, I really enjoyed the atmosphere and setting. Then I started groaning at the incredibly predictable behavior of the cardboard cutout characters. By1/4 of the way through, I found myself hypnotized by the parade of every stereotypical character I remember from the trashy adventure books I loved when I was12. The young, perfect hero. His loyal negro sidekick. The noble, tragic father. The backstabbing piratical villain. The fat, ugly, cowardly, corrupt, rich villain. The cruel villain who is, however, a "true warrior". The sultry temptress. The beautiful imprisoned princess. A half-dozen more plot elements which I won't reveal for fear of spoiling the book. In every way, at best an average book.
1	Fundamentals of Management: Fundamentals of Management is a great book to get started in management. It covers everything that you would need to know. I like this book in particular because it has chapter tests at the end of every chapter so that you can kind of test yourself over what you had just did. I also liked how the definitions are out to the side of the reading as well as in bold in the reading. It makes it easy to find the words that you are looking for. I have learned a lot from this book. I went with some experience in managing and still learned something new every time I turned the page. I feel this is a great book to get started with in management.
1	Well organized and easy to understand: My husband is using this book for his management class, so I'm giving you a second-hand review. I asked him how he liked the book, and the title of this review was his response. He's a man of few words, but the bottom line is that he finds the textbook very user-friendly, and it has benefited him a great deal in his class.
1	So cute monogrammed!: The bedding I picked out did not have a diaper stacker...so this one went perfect. To tie it in with the bedding I got the top monogrammed. It looks so cute! Very pleased with it!
1	Follett's Guide to Usage: As one who thinks it necessary to own every major English usage manual from Fowler on, I here state the firm opinion that Follett is the best of the reasonably contemporary examples and second only to Fowler. Follett is more erudite, more complete (not more comprehensive, I grant), and more analytical than the rest. (Yes, Bryan, this means you). For example, compare his treatment of the indefensible "in terms of" to any other.Someone speaks here of "disagreeing" with Follett's remarks on prescriptivism. Well, if you're not a prescriptivist then you oughtn't be reading usage manuals, and if you are one yet still disagree, you'd better find arguments more persuasive than his.Another critic says Follett isn't terribly useful as a quickhow-to guide. Well, true, but the genuine articles never are.
1	If you like the classics, then why not?: I read previous reviews of this DVD set, and almost didn't buy it because of the negative reviews. I was basically getting it for free, so I figured I might as well.I understand where the others are coming from regarding the item being digitally remastered, but if you really enjoy the classics, then you'll love this DVD set. My wife & I have watched several of the cartoons, and they bring back great memories of when we were kids. I don't care that it's not digitally remastered. Would it be nice? Yes, but I wouldn't let that stop you from getting this set.
0	No "Classics"... RIP OFF: I bought this expecting to get the classic xmas movies such as frosty the snowman and rudoff the rednose raindeer. I was VERY disappointed to find out neither were included. It has such movies as Frosty gets Married and Rudoffs 4th of July, all dumb movies made after the original just for money that aren't any good. It leads you to believe its a bunch of the classics but it is not. BEWARE, READ CAREFULLY WHAT YOU ARE GETTING!!!!
0	get your money back: Big disappointment, not what is perceived to be by the picture on the box....DO NOT ORDER IT!
1	Christmas Classics: This is a cute classic movie set and each disc has the main feature but then a another movie or two on it as well. I knew what I needed to order (I borrowed the box set but I broke one disc so I had to replace the whole thing). This was the cheapest place I found it. The set arrived very quickly. Thanks!
1	Clasic Christmas Favorites: The grandkids loved this one. Not only did they get the favorites but the set included several the family had not seen!
0	no little drummer boy 2: the trailer on this dvd set has advertisement for little drummer boy 2 but this dvd set does not have it instead you get pinnohios christmas dont know why warner did this but thats what is there
1	....And I'm Not a Stephen King FAN!!!!: While I don't relish in Horror pictures, something about the supernatural power of Good triumphing over Evil fascinates me. I have never been into KING. I do however love this movie and would watch it for years to come. It was scary, but not as gorry or as bloody as most. It was a great mystery that had you going until the very end. The best scene was the brother's return. I Cried!!! Not of Fright but of simple Emotion. IT IS A MUST SEE even if you are not into the KING!!!!
1	Should become a comedy classic: This is Cyrano de Bergerac updated and told with the craziness of Steve Martin's brain--a wonderful, funny movie. Martin is the fire chief of a scenic Northwest resort town. There are two newcomers to town: a professional firefighter (Rick Rossovich) and a beautiful female astronomer (Daryl Hannah). Martin, the self-assured, passionate but ugly (that schnoz) chief and Rossovich, the dumb but handsome hunk both fall for Hannah; of course Hannah is interested in the hunk. But Rossovich is unable to talk to bright women, so Martin feeds him lines and Hannah is swept off her feet. The mistaken identity is all worked out satisfactorily by picture's end (Martin wins Hannah). Everything works perfectly in this movie, and Martin is at his very best. I've watched this quite a few times over the years and the humor never gets stale. A terrific movie.
1	Charlie: He had very long nose, his buddies don't know what to do,or put out a fire if they found one. Her head is in the stars. Funny movie
0	One good song: I like one song on this cd. "It's in the Rain" is a beautiful song. The rest sound like they were rushed to be completed in order to meet the release date.I have all of her other cds and I usually enjoy them, but this is the first one that I only like one song. Creatively, this one is missing something. She also looks silly on the cover.So far in 2005, the only artist to release a completely amazing cd is Madonna with "Confessions on a Dance Floor." Maybe Enya could call Madonna's producer. She needs a new sound. It's time to reinvent yourself, Enya!
0	Predictable an uninspired.: Enya needs a change, or shes gonna end up like the new-age version of Madonna. Her fans who follow her blindly, will always give her good reviews. But this cd is Enyas worst. Not one song on this CD remotely began to move me inside. The whole CD is luke-warm while trying to be overly sentimental. (reminding me of Madonna once again). I could try to find a soung to recommend for download, but i cant even do that.Enya is slowing slipping into the void where once good artists who fail to change end up. Madonna, Enigma... and now Enya.
0	A long wait for "Enh!" (yuk): Now, before you other Enya fans go into defense mode, I want to say I really like her stuff and have been a fan of hers for many years.That being said...This album is a bit of a letdown after such a long wait. (Okay, a lot of a letdown.) It's...well...boring. It lacks the intricate construction, memorable melodies and harmonies that earlier albums and tracks have. Take "To Go Beyond II": It has almost a fairytale, magical sound to it; "China Roses": It has beautiful harmonies and "softness" in it that delight the ears; "Long Boats" has a feeling of power and strength in it.Sadly, "Amarantine" has none of that.We all know Enya can do much better. Hopefully, in the not too distant future, she'll cut a new CD where her magic will return.
1	You lose all cred ripping someone a new 'A' when you can't spell and make grammatical errors: I'm a little tired of hearing 'this is just the same as -blah blah- song/album and it's horrible/boring'. I love Ebadue and Africa i and ii, so I'm elated that 'the River Sings' has a similar feel. I think it's an amazing song and my favorite on the album. 'Amarantine' and 'Somebody Said Good-bye' remind me of the vocal songs from 'A Day Without Rain'. I never much cared for the songs with words before Wild Child, Lazy Days, etc, which are among my favorites from all of her works. 'Less than a Pearl' is hauntingly beautiful, and 'Semiregusa' is also very pretty.I've always enjoyed listening to any of Enya's albums to relax from a long day at work, for yoga and meditation; this album will definitely go into that mix. The above-mentioned songs will also go on my own 'Best of..' CD.
1	A Soothing Voice In a Chaotic World: If there is one musical constant in a world of chaos it is the soothing voice and melodic songs of Enya. I love her and her music. Her voice, music and her very being are inexorably intertwined giving us a feeling of warmth and passion in our hearts that I can not find the words to describe. How can I describe exactly how lovingly she finds the beauty that is still in our world, a beauty that each of us carries inside like a piece of some great cosmic puzzle that only has to be realized. Perhaps long in coming but I love the wait and savor the moment and here is Amarantine. I truly love every track but there seems to be a special place for "It's in the Rain" for me. I have said what I have tried to put into words. I just love her music.
1	Amarantine: More of the Good Same.: If you like Enya and you have them all, then by all means, get this album.Amarantine is beautiful. It's of the same timber as the rest of Enya's albums. [In honesty, if you find a bit of sameness troublesome then perhaps this album is not for you.]There are some variations. "The River Sings" has great Bounce. If I need to find a criticism then .... I felt that "It's In the Rain" was a little stilted. ...but only a little.I'll put all of Enya's CD's on shuffle play [that's 4 hours of music] and sit down, happy as a clam, with a good book. Amarantine is a good addition to Enya's discography....okay, I don't know what a clam would do with a good book, but I'm sure it would be happy.
1	Whyte Weaves Wonders: A friend's Florida condo is as unlikely a setting to begin Whyte's Camulod Chronicles as one can imagine, but from the first page I was there, in the farthest reaches of the Roman Empire before the Fall. Now, with The Sorcerer: Metamorphosis, Whyte's weaved a magical, 3-dimensional tapestry of the birth of nations and Arthur's Britain from the failures of an Empire. The series is amazing and thank all that's good, a venue for a great mind! Thank you, Mr. Whyte.
1	Worth Every Penny!: What can I say, the chapter on setting up your jointer is worth the price of the book by itself. The pictures and the diagrams are great, easy to understand, and the text is informative and easy to read. This book makes you a better woodworker, because your tools will be correctly set up, which also makes them more fun to use and much safer.I would recommend this book to you, even if you do not own the tool, but are looking at getting into woodworking, with this book you will be better able to understand how the various tools work, and you can buy decent used tools and tune them up, saving you a bundle!Great book!!
0	This doesnt do rage credit: The Cd is a disgrace, I almost laughed out lad at the singers voice. If youre in need of a few laughs then buy this- if you like music by any rage album! This CD doesnt deserve a star. The music doesnt compare to rage at all.
1	Looking Backward: I have a bad habit of diving into major events years after they occurred. I didn't understand Enron worth spit when it happened, and after reading this book(though the information is useless), I am conversant in the collapse, and picked up some insight about how stupid privately run utilities truly are. Nothing so essential should be left to crafty traders.
0	boring, boring, boring: Some have called this book a "basic guide" for the Enron mess. I would call it a basic guide for falling asleep. I worked at Enron, and there is nothing more annoying than self-proclaimed experts trying to explain the ins-and-outs of a company from the outside. It's about as accurate and useful as a binder-ful of news clippings. This book fails to capture the spirit of Enron, and fails to capture the essence of what really went wrong. I hope some better books come along, because the quick-and-dirty paperback version here was a waste of time and money.
1	Very Informative and Helpful: For anyone who searches to resolve the mysterious of stuttering, this is a must read. Bob has certainly discovered and reveals much of the mystery.
0	Larry Garfield is compared to?: When Danny Devito's plays Larry Garfield he is like Taxi's Louie De Palma of Wall Street.
1	Great speech by Larry at the end!: Not a bad movie -- not great, but better than average until the shareholder's meeting at the end. However, the speech that Larry the Liquidator (Danny DeVito) gives at the meeting is great! Larry explains -- very clearly -- why corporate takeovers are not a bad thing, and even why liquidation of an underperforming business is good. His speech ranks right up there with Francisco D'Anconia's speech in Ayn Rand's Atlas Shrugged.
1	Love having a female hero: My two and a half year old does not watch much TV but she loves Jane and the Dragon on Saturdays (she also likes Jacob Two Two and we have ordered those books as well). She was very excited when she saw the books as well. In a time when TV execs could not allow Dora to be on top (by giving Diego his own show) it is nice to have a female lead that is strong and brave but also sometimes makes mistakes and learns from them.The stories are interesting enough for older kids too.
1	Saw the TV show? Read the book.: If you have seen the wonderful Jane and the Dragon tv series you will enjoy the book. You hear the basic story in the theme song and wonder how Jane and her dragon met and what made the king let her train to be a knight. This book tells that story! It is an enjoyable story that engages everyone from children to adults. I highly recommend this book.
1	Great transmitter but not universal: I ordered this expecting it to come with a 3.5mm connection but came with a different connection. Although it says designed for zune the pictures are misleading so if your looking for a universal transmitter make sure it is in fact universal. This transmitter is great rarely get static and its stereo so thats a plus!
0	cant rate, don't work: I can't write a review because the DVD doesn't work when I put it in my DVD player. Terrible shame. Don't know why. Everything else works but this Frankie & Johnny DVD.
0	Read carefully before you purchase from Amazon - see below comments: I was upset with this Amazon purchase because when I played the movie (Frankie & Johnny, Michele Pfeiffer & Al Pacino) it said ' this disc may not be played in your region 'well, little did I know that the movie I purchased was in Swedish. How could that happen? Can you tell me Amazon where I can purchase this movie in English. I don't need to review the movie because I have seen it before and loved it..that is why I wanted to purchase it..so I could watch it again and loan it to friends. It was not a big hit movie and it is very hard to find. It is a movie from the1980's.Beware Amazon purchasers - read carefully before you purchase - read the fine print.Patricia
1	It's good, not great. About right for the price.: This sharpener is good, not great, but probably right for the price. I sharpened a bunch of pencils in a row (we homeschool) and it ran smoothly about 90% of the time. There were a few clunky starts, nothing dramatic but not perfect. Also, and this is the reason for the lack of stars; the drawer is a bit of a pain. When you sharpen, of course there are shavings in the small drawer which is accessible right on the front, below the hole. Well, when you go to put the drawer back in, it's a tiny bit of a struggle. There is a small plastic `tube' or offshoot in the back of the drawer and you have to line it up with a hole inside the machine. Because the drawer is a rather cheap plastic, as is the tube/offshoot, I had the feeling it would break if I let my kids use it. Decent length cord, about as noisy as any X-Acto electric sharpener.
0	Don't Waste Your Money: I bought this sharpener for my kids to use at home. We tried it a couple of times but it never sharpened a pencil evenly (wood all up one side so you can't write with it), it is really noisy, and vibrates a lot. It really feels like a bargain basement electric sharpener. I returned it and bought a Westcott iPoint Electric Pencil Sharpener which works so much better and is far less noisy.
0	Doesn't work!: This sharpener did not work from the first time I attempted to use it. It only hummed when a pencil was inserted into the sharpener. It seems like the motor is bad or just too weak. I’m sending it back.I do NOT recomend this item.
0	Disapointing: I ordered the Boston pencil sharpener and was sent the x-acto sharpener. I do not like it. My round pencils get stuck. The opening is not quite big enough. It is very noisy and it does not sharpen evenly. I sharpened three pencils and will return it. Very disapointing to get a different product than ordered.
1	It works: All I needed was something to sharpen pencils with. We always get those cheap sharpeners that cost 50 cents at walmart.....no good. This is perfect.
1	A reading escape: I want a novel that is well written. A book with story, plot, and characters that live and breathe. A book that for a few hours I can relax, lose myself, kick-back, and enjoy reading. Quiet Desperation is such a book and, for me, is the reason I love to read. I look forward to more advertures from Tuck Matson and more books from Mr. Smeraglia.
1	A knockout ride of a thriller.: Jeff Fahey's life goes to hell when he receives an arm transplant after an auto accident. Turns out the arm came from a serial killer! Written and directed by genre favorite Eric Red, Body Parts is mostly superior entertainment from beginning to end. Fast-paced, with several exciting action sequences (The pseudo-car chase and hospital finale come to mind) and a decent mystery make certain the movie never lets up. Drags a few times in the beginning and the story gets maybe a little too silly, but this is overall a gripping horror/thriller. Fahey is superb, as is Brad Dourif as an eccentric painter.***1/2 out of *****
1	theres a new sherriff in town!!: thses guys rock, and the vocals are 2nd to..well maybe dio ,well worth the price of addmission!
1	Reference Quality Blu-Ray Picture: This picture transfer on Blu-Ray is definitely reference quality and worth bragging about and showing off to your Hi-Def junkie friends.I can't comment on the lossless audio quality since I cannot decode quite yet.This is a "must have" for any Blu-Ray collection.
1	A movie that as it all!: Before I first watched "I, Robot" I was afraid it might have sold out as an action film. Thankfully I was wrong."I, Robot" contained an even balance of not only action, but psychology, sociolgy, philosophy, the clash of logic and emotions, life, and unconditional love. The movie made you think and feel with its knowledge, although its visuals and sounds were equally appealing with another nice balance of the present and the movie's version of the future. Such a natural feeling is rare in action films which helped the mind to agree that it is believable.If you watch this movie watch it not only for its action, but its beautiful philosophies. It can make anyone think. Or if you don't like to think, enjoy the action and seeing Will Smith naked in the shower (unless you don't swing that way). ;)
1	A surprisingly good adaptation: Loosely based upon Isaac Asimov's story, Will Smith's I, Robot is good. I rarely have anything good to say about such adaptations but this detective story set in a future in which robots are commonplace is well-done and gripping. Although I think the key plotline of following "breadcrumbs," or deliberately set clues, could have been done better the special effects are for the most part impressive and believable. The acting was good and I was pleased to watch it.
0	Not Asimov material: Smith has shown once again that he can only play one role - that of a disrespectful punk who grates on everyone's nerves. Asimov is probably rolling around in his grave right now. The special effects were good, but the acting was not. Chi McBride was great, and Bridget Moynihan did well, but Smith just reinforced the fact that he can't handle any role that doesn't exactly reflect his own personality and demeanor. I hope that some director in the future tries to cast Smith in a role that wasn't written for him - then we will all see that he really can't act his way out of a wet paper bag.Don't buy this on DVD - wait for it to come out on one of the cable movie channels...
0	Oh, how stupid can they be?: Well, a lot. More than a lot. Poor Will does his best with a doggie script. He accounts for the one star.I don't know why those enlightened movie companies insist in making one SF dog after another. Did you watch the "The Chronicles of Riddick", "Sky Captain", or "AvP"? There are plenty of others around, all of them sucking money out of our pockets.They need to fool us in order to pay for the great CGI effects I suppose. They fail to understand that if CGI is used to generate profits, it will kill the emotional content of the movie. What's left is the customary Hollywood Pablum dulling our senses.Do not relate this dog to any of Isaac Asimov's works. They stole the title and we shall punish them by forgetting this miserable mutt.
1	I, Robot: Loved this movie! Would have given it five stars if there had been a little romance thrown in. It was very good, even so.
0	Review is specific for this combo pack more than the movie: I ordered the 3D/Bluray combo pack for the action/graphics. It's a typical Will Smith big budget action movie (so if you like those you'll like this).I don't post many reviews but I wanted to on this 3D/Bluray pack because the 3D disc does not play on my Vizio 3D Bluray player. The disc acts like it is going to load, and then just ejects. I ordered it a second time thinking that I had received a defective disc the first time. I was wrong. The second one did the exact same thing.Save your time and money and order a normal DVD.
0	Not Even The Same Story As The Book!!!: The story is totally different than the book. All they took was the name and a couple of the characters.The story was pretty much a rip-off of the Terminator. Just think about it.(...) What is this thing next to the what, who did this and why?
0	Ugh! What a travesty that this book was published!: Drag, drag, drag. I kept reading for two reasons: the first, I had nothing better to do one Sunday, and the second, I kept hoping something significant would happen. It didn't. This story had no climax, no capture, no passion. Who wants to read about the somber day to day lives of boring spinsters? (Of course I did, what a waste). Alice Hoffman is off my reading list. Her use of profanity was unwarranted and did not emphasize meaning in anything. Her characters were flat and the overall flow was slow if not stagnant. The ending was short and curt, as if she was just as bored writing it as it was to read. Unremarkable!
1	Maybe 3 and1/2 Stars: I picked this book up expecting to get lost in a magical world (maybe something like Harry Potter!) but this book failed to deliver on that front. The magic was underhanded and unorganized. However, with that said, this was still a good read. Examining the dynamics between two generations of sisters was interesting, and the writing moved along comfortably. Overall, it's worth reading, but don't expect to be mesmerized!
1	terrific: The book was great! I have already recommended it to friends of mine. I would definitely read it again and again.
1	A peppy lil guy that gets the job done!: HIGHS: suction, bare floor cleaning, retractable cord, quietness, ease of useLOWS: tips easily, not great for carpets, bag capacityVERDICT: A good little helper on hard surfaces but not ment for carpeted areas.
0	For Those Who Like Intellectual Jibberish: If you liked high school poetry class, you might like this movie. Both my wife and I hated it because the teachers always seemed to find some meaning in a poem that completely mystified us. I thought this movie was going to be a search for the missing sixteen-year-old sister of the main character. If she found out what happened, it must have been hidden just like those esoteric 'meanings' our teachers found in the poems they assigned. I thought the movie was still setting the background when it suddenly ended. What it was all about, I have no idea.This is a movie for those who like to spout intellectual jibberish and think it means something. Or, maybe you have to be on some kind of illegal drug to make any sense of this movie?
1	After all it is Poe: Great reading, year after year his works endure. Wish I had had the opportunity to meet him in person, no I'll haveto wait until the afterlife. Hope we both end up in the same place.
1	Lullabies to paralyze: Well, as this album leads from songs for the deaf, i also have to say, this is a really good album. Long slow goodbye, little sister, and in my head are really good songs, and someone's in the wolf, (another song on the album) is good. and practically every song is pretty good. I would say the worst song(s) are broken box, and you got a killer scene there man. Well, let's see what our surprise is on the next album......
0	Flummery: Surely, dear reader, this book must be a parody of Austen and Trollope. But one turns the pages with an uneasy consciousness that one has not been let in on the joke.
1	Water Filter: This is exactly what was described and perfect! It fits right under the counter and is so easily installed. We searched forever to find a decent looking spout along with the water filter for under the sink and we finally found Aquasana!
1	Best Steak Seasoning Ever: This is the best steak seasoning I've ever found in a store. I've established a great reputation for my steaks based on this seasoning. Unfortunately my local grocer stopped carrying it! I am worried I won't be able to find it any longer. It really is the best!!
1	my mistake: I bought this to replace the 'fish' that my dog loved and we lost in the woods. I was excited about the 'turtle'. When it arrived it is tiny! My mistake as it clearly states it is for small dog. My 70# lab does love it still. I wish the 'turtle' came in a size for a large dog. Overall, it is a sturdy toy, my dog can break any squeaker but he does not destroy these, very strong/sturdy.
1	Nice to share: I don't like to journal because of the big, blank page staring up at me. This is a great compromise because the space for gratitude isn't vast. My sister and sister-in-law were pleased to receive the journal as gifts, too.
1	Great little journal: Received this as a Christmas gift from a dear friend, and I just love it. Keeps me in the moment and helps me remember all the wonderful things to be grateful for each day.
1	This is great!: This journal allows you to highlight the good things in your life. It makes you think of the positive rather than the negative. It is a must-have!
0	Excellent Adventure, but way Bogus Journey: This movie was nowhere near the original, so should you wish to watch it, don't expect to be in stitches the whole time. I honestly like it less and less each time I watch it, which to me is a mark of a bad movie. It does have it's moments, hence the 2 stars (it is after all Bill and Ted, it HAS to have moments!). My suggestion is rent/borrow it before purchasing it. If you love it--buy it. If not--don't.
0	Bogus, package labeled correctly: Whole family loved the first when viewed in 2011, it is aging well. This one is not aging well too many things are too bogus to keep the story line going.The scene with the Reaper's Challenge is the only redeeming scene and even that one is slower than most scenes in today's comedies. Only watch if you are a "Bill and Ted" Historian.
0	WORST FREAKING MOVIE EVER FREAKIING CREATED: although i do agree with all the reviews below mine, i would have to say this movie freaking sucked. It is the abomination of the movie world. It should have never been created, I got this in my cereal box, yep i was pouring my fruity lucks when this dvd popped into my cerial bowl. I tryed biting it to see if it was candy, but to no avail it was actually the dvd. I was so disappointed i decide to watch it, I thought i might get a good laugh out of how corny and cheesey... mmm. cheese... I want popcorn. THe movie actually scared me, and i had to go to the store to buy beer, and asprin. I then went to a party and talked about how bad this movie was. then i talked to alpha571 about it. I couldn't believe that there was a movie with russel crowe in it, where he wasn't yelling. Anyway, i liked the part in the movie where they died. that was the only funny part and they should have ended it there. good night everybody!
1	Funny! Funny! Funny!: Bill & Ted are killed by "robot us-es". They were sent from the future to prevent the birth of "Wyld Stalions" Bill & Ted must now challenge death & escape the afterlife to set things right. Side splitting fun! Recommended!
0	That Boy Mike Jones Is A Fake Man: That boy mike jones is about to get what is coming to him. He running around houston claiming he the king of the streets boy please. If anyone want to hear some real underground rap from houston go get that Chamillionaire (The MixTape Messiah) cause that is a true mc that should be out there cus Dike Jones -Who- Dike Jones his album is never coming soon. He has been saying that it is coming soon since 2002 but all he has done is put out two trash cds before he would even put out the cd he been talking about for two years. now he about to put out a cd with Paul Wall Called -The Future- but where in the hell is His Solo album. Oh Yeah it coming soon since 2002. Paul Wall messed when he turned his back on Chamillionaire but That Mixtape Messiah pt.2 expose this fraud ni--as. So go get that Chamillionaire The Mixtape Messiah. SO you can remember what real underground music is. Hiram Clarke Tx.
0	Way Too Small For Anything but the Camera: If you bought a camera and you want somewhere to keep all your "stuff" - nothing outrageous but things like cords, a couple of CDs, maybe a wireless mic, this is NOT your bag. It will carry only your camera. No extra stuff. Buy this to carry your "stuff" and you will still be relegated to carrying the rest of your items around in a plastic grocery sack.
0	Did not live up to expectations: Getting the book, I thought it 'would change my life' through all the insight Sennett would bestow on me. Sadly not the case, it was a lackluster title. I don't really have any suggestions as to what might be better.
0	Long and allegorical: Too long.May sound good if you don't know your Bible or Biblical History.The world won't end on 2011 either.
1	Any Fan will be happy.: I did have some concern from other reviews that mentioned the lackluster sound quality. I am very picky about my sound. But the price made me do it and I am happy I did. This CD had all the songs I needed to fill out my collection. The quality was not an issue at all. This is well worth the money, you will not be disappointed. This is a perfect addition to that EWF fan that wanted to grab a few songs on ITUNES, you can get this CD have everything you needed and more for the cost of a few songs on Itunes.
1	what's up w/ Jarrett: This is a great album of atmospheric, moody music. Gary's bass sounds great and he plays well throughout. Jack accents the mood and only really opens up on the last two tracks. I would consider this one of my all time favorites if not for one thing: Keith Jarrett moaning and whining. I can't understand it. His playing is so beautiful and lyrical, all overlaped w/ these strange and annoying noises. I know it is an expression of emotion while playing, but I find it highly destracting. This album, though, is good enough to look past it. Barely.
1	Nice supplement to study Meisner work.: Nice explanations as to why you learn the words in the way that you do and all books in this series include notebook client pages for you to take notes or practice the exercises. I liked the fact that he included questions of the class and his answers to those questions.
1	A way to understand the language of film.: As a college film instructor, I find Persona a wonderful text for students to begin to understand the ways film language operates. With it, the critical viewer can surpass content-based approaches to film and begin to understand the way film communicates visually. Not only do I find the film valuable for my students, but myself as well. I love to watch it and unravel its complex and compelling messages. In approaching such a bold and innovative work, I find much of what I love in movies. That experience is beautiful. Persona is one of the few films which can do that for me as well as it does.
0	Nope, not worth it: Rated at1000mAh, just like the original Panasonic battery for my TZ5. Only had1/2 the life at first. A little over a year later, it only lasted for 4-8 picture and 3-5 minutes' worth of video. After a year and a half, this battery is dead. Not even recommended as a backup. Spend the extra few dollars and get one with a better user rating, more mAh, or better yet, just get the Panasonic.*Update: I returned it under their 3 year warranty (though they now say it's only 2). I had to pay $2 to ship it back to them (which is fine), and now they say I owe them another $7.50 for shipping and handling. Wow, this battery only costs $7.14 new right now.**Update #2: I ignored their request for another $7.50, but after a month or so, they sent me a new one anyway (which has been sitting in my desk ever since, since I bought a higher quality backup battery in the meantime...the Kinamax1300mAh S007 for about15 bucks).
1	Siempre hay que tener 2 baterías: Les recomiendo que siempre tengan 2 baterías, la original con la que viene la cámara, en mi caso la Panasonic Lumix DMC-TZ5K, y otra de reemplazo para que nunca se pierdan ningún momento por tener la batería descargada. Carga perfectamente en el cargador original de la cámara y su precio es muy muy bajo... comparen y verán.
1	Works Great: Most Panasonic cameras have a pretty good battery life. Unless you shoot a lot of pictures, or use the flash a lot. In that case, you will need another battery and this is a good choice.
0	bleh: well, they don't taste like anything... and they're really hard to bite into - not crispy, just really hard. If you're a sailor from the eighteenth to ninteenth century and you're used to "ship's biscuit", then I'm sure you will love these as they've got more protein and better taste, and are also in nice sealed packages (no weavils!) They remind me of Woody Allen's line, "I could make a lot of money selling these in a health food store."I went for these because of all the rave reviews, and I am now dissapointed. I guess I can feed these to my boyfriend... he might eat them if he's really hungry and there's nothing else.
1	Nice album for the sad times: Hefner is really awesome. If you listen "Love will destroy us in the end" you may find the most sensitive, yet funny, song of the album and it's quite surprising that a band can do that without using epic arrangements with horns and all that stuff. I recommend this album because no one has this one and i'd love to talk about it with anyone.
0	DO NOT BUY THIS EDITION: PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS EDITION! IT IS POORLY EDITED AND FULL OF TYPOS AND ERRORS. GET THE PENGUIN EDITION INSTEAD.
0	Good movie, terrible DVD: I have no problems with the movie. But technically, the quality of this disc is beyond terrible. It looks like a YouTube video does when you play it on a 50-inch plasma. Only worse -- compression artifacts, tiling with squares the size of Post-it Notes, banding that looks like16-bit grayscale. It made the whole thing unwatchable for me. [...]
0	DEFECTIVE PRODUCT: I ordered and had to return two separate copies of this DVD because of wavy lines in the picture on both copies.
1	Detour: Made by a Poverty Row studio in just six days, this cynical, acid-tongued noir exemplified what a skilled director like Ulmer could do on a shoestring budget. Narrated by Neal, whose weary voice is that of a man recounting a terrible nightmare, "Detour" wallows in grim fatalism and sports a wildly venomous turn by Savage, as the castrating vixen who blackmails Al into a seedy get-rich scheme. Crisp pacing, rabid dialogue, and on-the-fly camerawork make this disturbing and fascinating "Detour" well worth taking.
1	Great book: Wonderful book if you want to know more about the practices of the samurai. I bought this for my boyfriend and he found it very useful.
1	Path to integrity: This work is from the memoirs of an enlightened soul . written some 600 years ago, still applies to every day life in the 21st century. Better than any "self help" book on the market. It's a self help guide, to peace - integrity - and enlightenment of our soul . Seen through eyes of a free spirit, indentured to service. living by a code
1	Insight into the spiritual ideals of the Samurai: The translation may be a little enigmatic at times, but the core of the material is extraordinary. As a historical document, it reflects on the ideals that defined the Samurai spirit, and laments the loss of this selfless nature.
1	Love This Mat: This mat is perfect for me. The10mm thickness provides the cushion that I need for my ankles, back, and knees. I also love that it is decomposable, recyclable, does not absorb moisture, is toxic-free, hypoallergenic, and wipes clean with a mild solution of soap and water. Very much worth the price.
1	Best Value for the $$$: Easy to put together. Came with very good and clearcut instructions.You have to have a good amount of floor space for it to turn though.Other than that it is a super buy!!!
0	One-Sided and incomplete: One can go on forever about who is pro this or pro that, but the truth is that the most complete and recognized book on the subject of the Liberty is written by Jay Cristol, a United States Judge who has devoted his life to the FACTS of what went on that day. This book shows one side, from an emotional person who was hurt and angry. If you read this book, you do yourself and history a disservice if you do not read Jay Cristol's book as well. I was "horrified" by the incident, as any American would be, until I read the explanations and facts addressed by Judge Cristol. Seemingly impossible facts to refute, mentioned in this book, have complicated but indisputable answers. A country fighting for its life does not brutally attack its ONLY ally in the world. There are answers, and this book does not have them. Judge Cristol's book does.
1	I bought it by mistake.: First, let me say that I ordered this movie by mistake.I wanted to order more movies but I got this instead.How are you supposed to get the movies you want?Now I have the movie I want so I watch it. It is called theWorld's nuttiest nutcracker. Which is why I bought this moviebecause it's about world records for who is the nuttiest of all.Let me repeat that I hate cchristmass. But I love movies about christmass. I dont have to deal with my own family because I hate them. So now I watch this movie and I like it like 4 stars out of 5, it is insane. There are all these people in the moviethat look like cheap plastic, but wait they are not real, they are realtime 3d people/fruit. So that caught my Eye and I loved the fact that this was a good choice to buy and then watch thisawfull film
0	Not So Great...: I purchased this video in a bookstore on Cape Cod last summer and was disapointed. Though I admit no video or photograph can match the beauty of the Cape that I know, this video is both dated and technically rough around the edges. The content was a little superficial as well.Sorry, if this sounds superficial, but hopefully they'll update it.
1	Touching tale of committment and love.: A young boy opts to adopt an abused and neglected dog in need of a home rather than raise a coveted purebreed pup and learns that hard-earned love is sometimes the sweetest to receive. Ukrainian artist Katya Krenina's illustrations are delightful and Lisa McCourt's tale of a boy and his dog seemed particularly relevant to our family's own adoption story.
1	On time and new as described: Reasonably priced and shipped on schedule. Valves and membranes were new and in packaging as described. Pricing is very competitive and purchasing was easy.
0	no accolades here: I threw this book in the trash, I was so very disappointed. Characters are flat, story lines are absurd........why would I be interested in a stepmother sleeping with her stepson after the funeral of her husband? All of you who seem to love this author, switch to Elizabeth Berg.....superior author and stories with depth.
1	Unique Subject Matter: "Come to Me" is a book of short stories. Each one dealing with outrageous, extraodinary, unimaginable subject matter.Such as..."Love is not a Pie" about a husband and wife who bring another man into their bed.OR..."Sleepwalking" A stepmother seduces her stepson. (Naughty)"Silver Water"... A tearjerker about a girl remembering her sister'slife and suicide."Only You"...A bored housewife who falls head over heals with her hairdresser who happens to be a transvestite.My favorite---"Phychoanalysis Changed My Life"...A (very smart) therapist has a plan to set her son up with a patient. (unexpected and colorful)!If you're seaching for skillful writing, unique metaphor, truth, and the element of uncut surprise...this is definitely the book for you.>>NOTE>> Even though I did not agree with some of the subject matter, I found myself identifying with the characters.
0	Poor: A very poor book. Don't bother. From the title, you'd think the book has interesting information from high-level commanders. It doesn't. It's mostly just a bunch of ramblings, often contradictory. The chapter on Finland maybe would rate three stars. I think the only useful information in the whole book otherwise was the information on the number of snow-plows per mile that were needed to keep roads clear. If you are looking for any other logistical info, forget it. The description of the book is highly misleading, and I regret having bought it.
0	Neither Savage or Sensuous: I must admit that the title caught my attention. Sad to say the music won't. It reminded me of being in a department store elevator stuck in the mezzanine and unable to get out. You can save yourself. If you want good exotica buy a Les Baxter CD.
0	Greek: This was not a very good movie, nor well acted. Anthony Quinn always play good movies but this one was just o.k.
1	Great book, great information, great photographer!: I think that Ansel Adams was a great photographer, I personally love photography, and would love to see more professional photographers.
1	A Good Resource Book: Grasping God's Word makes an excellent resource book for any personal library. It is written in such a way that readers on several levels of education may find it informative and useful. A strong emphasis on application of Scripture is much appreciated.
0	College book: Thank you for sending the book fast so that I could start reading it for my college class
1	Run a full size smaller - but toasty warm: I have several other pairs of slippers for winter, and these are my absolute favorite. they're so warm and comfortable. My only two complaints though are that I'd like to see a more supportive footbed. Also, they do run a full size too small, so be sure to order one size up. I did so at the recommendation of the other reviewers, and they were right. The sole of the slipper is also non-slip.
0	do not order these: I received mine yesterday and returned them today. The uppers are glued to the sole in a haphazard fashion. Once you put them on, you can feel the edges where the uppers are glued and clipped on the inside. I doubt they would last long. Glue is not the way to go. They should be stitched. Shoddy workmanship all the way around. I am sorry I paid for the shipping to get them. and the shipping to send them back. All in all, $16 to find out they were shoddy. Never again!
1	Warm but less than perfect: Shearling is the best slipper material I have ever tried, so I've owned a number of shearling slippers. The sole of these is not as cushy as others I've had, and they don't feel quite as snug (which makes slippers snuggly). Having a non-shearling outer sole, as these do, is key for any sort of durability. Not a bad buy at the price, but there's a little compromise.
1	Good Christmas Present: My wife asked for slippers to replace some old, warn ones I'd given her years before At that point the mall was beyond crowded, so I went online. After browsing for what seemed a LONG time (I'm a guy, I hate to shop), I found several, and finally narrowed it down to this. She loves them! And for a "color challenged" guy, I even picked the right color. They are great!
0	Almost a whole size too small: I bought these last year and tried them on - too small, but I thought perhaps they'd stretch out a bit. WRONG! I've been wearing them now - still almost new - for a month now w/ no luck on any stretching. My toes are smushed all the way to the end and they hurt! I even have a narrow foot, for what it's worth - not that the width would affect much. Still - bummer..
1	Great for the price.: I bought these when they were deal of the day for around $15. Can't complain about a deal like that. In response to the reviewers who said to order a size up I'd say maybe order up a half size if you like your slippers fairly loose. When I first got mine I thought they would be too small but after wearing them a couple of days they stretch out and I think they run pretty tru to size. I wouldn't pay $50 for them but if I see them for deal of the day again I'll be buying them for all my family.
1	Fixed more than Our Table Issues (no doubt!): We brought this baby home, expecting the most. Boy, did we get it. It was one of those nights: Clarance and Arnold are "on their way", six others were expected. I had an amazing recipe from Marie Curie (Spanish salad!) and Ken had squeezed the juice clean from the cranberry. We threw the table together, and after some simple instructions (and not less than two stubbed thumbs) we were in "biz"! I would decide to tell anyone that this tool really has something for everyone. Pleased customer.
1	Widge: I like this product when using my Bosch combo kit on my router table. This base allows me to adjust the router bit height from above the router table by using the included Hex Key. In additon, I can leave this base permanently attached to the router table. I simply pull the motor out of the base that's attached to the router table and then stick it into one of the other router bases when I want to use the router freehand. Very convenient.
0	Bad product.: This product really sticks. I bought a couple days ago and then had to return it. I couldn't even set up the VNP because there was no proper documentation. I call Netgear and their support was no help at all. The router couldn't work wirelessly and wired simultaneously for the same machine... without reset the router... What I am trying to say is if you connected wirelessly to the router and then disconnected that wireless connection and then plugged into the router with your wired LAN cable... you would not have a connection. Unless you went into the the router wirelessly and resetted it manaully. The latest firmware upgrade they have for the router is a beta v1.2 - And if you have a a problem with beta versions of their firmware you cannot call them (Netgear).... you have to email .... beta@netgear.com or something like that. It does have alot of cool features but there are too many glitches. Hope this review helps.
0	decent products - awful technical support: I've had a variety of netgear products over the last 3-4 years. I've generally been pleased w/features and functionality.Up until recently I've never had to draw on netgear tech support. However, after a year of working fine one of my firewall/routers went "kerplunk." All the signs point to a hardware problem. So I contacted tech support realizing that I'd have to go through the usual rigamorole (sp?) to get an RMA.However, despite a very detailed email description of the problems and the various things I did to try and fix them (firmware upgrades/reinstalls, hardware resets, etc) the tech who answered me told me I'd have to contact them through telephone support.Currently (11:10 PM Eastern Time, 29 July 2003) wait times for tech support are in excess of140 minutes! That's unacceptable.If you are lucky enough to never need tech support, or to have an item repaired/replaced then netgear is a fine option. Otherwise, buyer beware!
0	Waste of Time.: Viewed: 7/11Rate: 27/11: Zzzzz...watching The Addams Family is like pouring nitric acid on my brain. I hate all of the characters, and it gets ever annoying to watch Gomez to be fancy and exciting doing things. It's like...Can the nightmare end? Even though it is a101 minute flick, The Addams Family is just too long to sit through. The plot is idiotic, and the whole time, I am wondering why couldn't they have electrocuted Fester in hopes of kicking his amnesia over. I am surprised that, despite the fact that everybody in the family likes dark incidents and so so, nobody was abusing drugs. Wake me up when somebody hires Thing for a job...like he has a social security number. Did the film really start the gothic trend where stupid kids in high school were dressing up all in black and pretending to have mental and emotional problems? All in all, The Addams Family is a terrible piece of rubbish that manages to make time to crawl very slowly.
1	Great look at the feastival!: I thought this was a great book - especially for someone just learning about this like me. The writing is easy to get into (in some cases a bit too cutsy I'm afraid but I looked past that). I enjoyed the section on the history of halloween across cultures although in some ways it seemed like too much of a high level synopsis but it was an ok introduction. The section on halloween symbols was excellent since we see all these things typically at halloween (black cats, witch hats etc). There are some fun divinations which include runes. And there are of course blessings and recipes etc. I think this would be a great family book - to give kids (all of us really) a bit more meaning to the day rather than just getting a stash of candy from the neighbors. Definitely a great introduction and fun stuff to do. I'm giving it 4 stars rather than 5 since I was expecting a bit more substance but its fun nonetheless.
1	Loved This Book!: Really opened my eyes on the myths,misconceptions and superstitions.Silver made me smile more than once. I plan on reading it again.VERY informative. Also recommended reading is Silver's To Stir A Magick Cauldron and To Ride A Silver Broomstick. Check out author Yasmine Galenorn also!
1	Box Of Hair: I heard that Cub broke up. If it's true it's truly tragic. Cub are a female trio from the Great White North who specialize in sugary-sweet pop gems with a very little bit of a country feel. Sometimes they remind me of The Fastbacks. They play clean with little or no distortion & make good use of light-hearted humor. The Last 2 tracks "Riverside" & "Not What You Think (Live)" show that they can do much more than the seemingly empty cutsie pop songs. Their pop songs, however, are not as vacuous as they may appear to be on the surface. They are smart, creative & heart warming. I don't know if this is Cub's best album, because they are all so good, but I do know that if bands like Heavenly, Go Sailor & Butterglory make you happy, then so will Cub.
0	Poor performance: This brand was my 2nd Delonghi thermal carafe model in 2 months, after the first one broke after 5 weeks. This one worked wonderfully for about 4 weeks until one morning. I came in and found coffee all over the counter. I thought I had not aligned the pot properly or something. After another week of dealing with this, the electrical system shorted out due to all the coffee spills. This coffee maker made the best coffee and the carafe kept it hot all day. I don't know what happened and we couldn't get it resolved. We purchased a Cuisinart with a 3 yr warranty (not the one that grinds coffee) and has worked great for 6 weeks.
0	Terrible packaging: The kit came in one of those treacherous plastic molded shells designed to hang on a store display. It took almost10 minutes and several bloody fingers to access the contents. Of course the picture on the Amazon website does not show this egregious over-packaging.
0	Stupid Amazon Return Policy: Amazon won't take back the item, even if it is UNOPENED. Even if I pay for return shipment. What a second rate retailer...
0	LWatLA: If you had a rating of -100 it would be rated below that. The case is solid but has no on & off switch. The soft ware program is rip rip rip off. no customer service. Still have not heard back from them.I would not advise my worst enemy to buy this product. It was awast of time, money & efor. do not,do not buy this product.
0	Dell 700/710m laptop owner beware: This product makes a copy of the new disk from old disk. But it is not bootable using the EZ GIG 2 software. I have Dell Media Experiance but not Dell Media direct. After trying for two weeks and researching I got hold of tech support, really. Waited on hold for 45 min. After talking with them. I was told it does not work for the dell 700/710m laptops. So now instead of using my new120GB drive to replace my 80 GB drive. I have another120GB external drive. But it does have all my files and programs.Sadly it was a waste of money.
0	Alan Moore's writing for comics: I wanted more of a "how to book" on comic writing, concerning breaking in, making contacts, etc. Too much drawing plot comparisons and witty talk. It's a small enough book to skim through and I didn't find what I was looking for. Maybe it helps out the aleady established comic writer? But for those of us who have yet to make it. Nah.
1	How to create comics from the man who changed them.: Alan Moore's work is among the most influential in the comics field. This essay, which is bound in a comic-style format, is short but gets the creative juices going. He shares some useful insight into storycraft and framing plots for the comics medium. I do not write comics (prose fiction is my area), but I dound this insightful and inspiring. If you like his work in Watchmen and Swamp Thing, this is definitely worth picking up. And it is very, very cheap.
1	love this book: I love this book for reference on the job. It has tons of diseases and has a great format. I used the full version in nursing school so I found it easy to navigate when i started to practive. It also comes with a code so you can download the book to your PDA.
1	My Great Aunt Arizona: This is a wonderful book. As an elementary teacher I especially enjoy reading it with my students and own a classroom set. It is a beautiful story of a teacher and contains lovely illustrations. It is a sweet depiction of schools and life long ago.
1	Great, so where is it now?: If you like Seal and his passionate, powerful voice then this abreviated release is a must have. Stripped of all the production effects these raw versions of some of Seal's best songs show Seal for the artist he is and they really highlight the emotional power of his voice. The huge problem is you can't find this release anywhere anymore. That's a true disservice to Seal and his fans.
0	Title is misleading!!!!: You would think that a DVD with an alluring girl on the cover and had the word "SEX" in the title would well, have SEX in the actual movie. But, you'd be completely wrong if you bought Phone Sex Fantasies because there is NO sex, real or simulated in the entire DVD! Basically, the girls talk dirty (sorta) and then take off their clothes. That's it.
1	Olivia, the vocalist: While promoting this album in1989, Olivia appeared on a TV show with Dionne Warwick. During the show, Dionne said how Olivia's voice could be defined : clear as crystal. And that's exactly what this CD showcases : Olivia Newton-John's crystal clear voice.Hitting wonderful high notes in such a soft way, Olivia delivers standards such as "Over the rainbow" or "Reach out for me" with that special quality that makes her so unique. My favorite tracks on this are, by far, "You'll never walk alone" and "When you wish upon a star" - these always give me goosebumps...Originally intended for her then 3 year old daughter, this CD is a perfect gift for moms-to-be, or just simply a wonderful gift, either for yourself or for someone else...
0	Just plane bad cap.: When I received this cap I thought I was getting a letter. The cap was crammed into a flat envelope. Terrible quality,very flimsy brim. Awful item. I don't know where the positive reviews came from. This is a cap I will NEVER wear. In fact it went from the envelope it came from straight into the trash where it belongs. Very bad buying experience would not ever buy from this seller again. This is NOT a military cap. It's a crap cap made in China.
0	Best Data 56K USB Modem Macintosh: As other reveiwers noted this modem cannot stay connected. You can reestablish connection by unplugging and plugging the USB but this is a pain. Instructions that come with modem are incomplete and do not give information about lights. Also Best Data tech support does not respond. There are bound to be better choices.
0	Not worth the title 'junk': I purchased this device at my local Frys on an employee recommendation and also based on details on the box. I could not get my g41.25 dual to see the modem in spite of everything I tried. The tech support would not respond, the website has no mac drivers, my mac wouldnt recognize it as a USB device and the included instructions and the CD have no drivers or details that would be helpful. After a frustrating few weeks I gave up and returned this. The only thing it did properly was power on when connected to a usb port. Pathetic.
1	James Last Tango: This is a fantastic CD, and again, one of my favourties. I can remember hearing tracks from this in the early1980's, and thinking how great they were. I ordered a "used" one from Amazon, and it plays perfectly. If you like Tango music, then I think you will enjoy this.
1	The day the world came to town: Having recently watched a "Made for TV" movie based on the true events contained in this book I was anxious to read the facts about the way the good folk of Gander, Newfoundland rallied round & accomodated, fed & entertained an influx of 6,600 air travellers aboard 39 planes which had been diverted to their town due to American airspace being shut down on 9/11.I was not disappointed !Jim Defede, the writer, presents a very well written account of the 4 days that the world came to Gander & chronicals both the huge logistical operation and the emotional experiences for both passengers and townsfolk.Many friendships were formed over those 4 days which exist to the present day, and I cannott commend the town of Gander enough for the humble, caring way they held out the hand of genuine friendship to complete strangers.This is a " must read" book.
1	A different look at 9/11: I really enjoyed this book. It gives you a different perspective on Sept.11th. We have read so many stories of the people who perished on that day and this story talks about those people who were totally inconvenienced by the events. It is so interesting to hear their stories and how this little town welcomed these people from all over the world. Many of the stories are very heartwarming and also sad. Once you get started it is a hard book to put down. Highly recommended for anyone who has more interest in reading about 9/11.
1	They work!: I have tried every ice pack on the market! The ace ones are great, but every single one leak! No matter how careful I am with them.....they leak at the seams. These are less expensive and with proper care last forever! When using them cold, you do need a cover of some sort........an old pillow case works well folded over several times. Plus the size works well. Big enough to sit on your head for those migraines without falling off easily. Sometimes holding your head still to keep the ice pack on ends up hurting your neck, which makes your head worse. Defeats the purpose. For the money, this one is a good choice!
1	My 2 year old literally took his breath away he was so excited!!: WHAT A TOY!! Better than the Thomas table, this thing is solid! SO nice, it comes with all the people and vehicles and trees and fire departments, etc. I am overwhelmed. My 2 year old loves it and has not stopped playing with it! Thanks!!!!
1	Mom of twins equals needs something durable!: My son is 21/2 and spends hours a day playing with his table. Wonderful purchase! Only negatives is that one leg was cracked during shipping and the other is my little boy is too busy playing for me now!
0	fair towards midland: This book is typical of its genre. It relies heavily on Snorre Sturlusson's "Prose Edda", which is one of the clearest sources on Nordic Mythology, it must also be kept in mind that Snorre was writing several hundred years post Heathen and was also highly influenced by classical forms of Mythological models. In short, Snorre's work reads like Greek myth with Nordic characters. Not to mention that he was not writing a handbook on Heathen belief, he was writing a handbook on poetry, particularly skaldic metric form and added the myth parts for reference. Snorre's work is useful as a secondary reference at best, and if Snorre got it wrong, and a book (this one) is based on Snorres works.... well... you get the picture.
0	This light absolutely sucks: Don't waste time or money on this garbage - you can't mount it, and the replacement battery is very expensive. Useless!
0	Book Critic2: I was a little dissapointed with this purchase because it claims to be hardcover but in actuality it is three ring punched and individual pages. It is complete and in very good condition though. I would still consider purchasing from this agent since the prices are very low.
1	And most important, my wife likes it....: I was not sure if I wanted a rocker or a fixed recliner for my outdoor porch. I came across this glider by accident and at first dismissed it. I remember as a kid seeing gliders made of metal with springs that groaned and made up of fused together rust. After reading other reviews and taking a chance, I bought it. It went together easily enough except for one locking bolt that did not line up. I had read another reviewers suggestion that I keep a drill handy, and with that and a little persuasion, it came together fine. Even though the wood was treated at the factory, I live in Florida where everything gets old before it's time,so I gave it a treatment with teak oil. It looks great, feels solid and is very comfortable. Great buy for the price.
0	A word of warning to "jazz" fans: This album has British saxophonist Courtney Pine really coasting - smooth & mellow with a predominance of synthesisers & drum programming with no real "blowing" or hard edges. Very, very reminiscent of Kenny G with some synthesised reggae inflections & also some rather schmaltzy vocal work. If you like that sort of thing, fine, but in my humble opinion "smooth" jazz like this just isn't worth the time or money, given the abundance of truly high quality, inventive jazz available.
1	X-Pulse: Get your heatbeat pounding with the newest expansion to the popular MechWarrior 4 Vengeance!With the addition of new Mechs, like the Sunder, Wolfhound, Uller and More, you will be able to trade on the black market for new weapons and mech chassis.I highly recommend this game, as a sysop with the Microsoft Gaming Zone!!! Play it online with up to15 other people for the ultimate players experience....
0	Newbie: I didn't get to review the book I was looking for before I got sent to sign up as a new customer to Amazon. I don't know how to get back to the info on the book from this link to review it before rating it. Sorry.
0	Ow!: These shoes look cute and got good review, so I decided to give them a try. Even though I ordered a half-size larger than I normally wear, they hurt so much when I tried them on that I never even wore them out of the house. I returned them and am planning to buy a pair of Dansko wedges.I should mention that I have very attractive feet - big, flat, and square (like Fred Flintstone) - that only respond well to orthopedic-looking shoes. If your feet are of a daintier variety, these might be fine.
0	Print version has no industry information like the older version. Not worth subscribing if you are in the industry.: Years ago, the Hollywood Reporter print subscription had everything any pro or aspiring pro in the movie business needed to know. The current print version is more for movie fans than the industry trade it used to be. You must subscribe to the digital online version to get the industry information instead of the print version now.
0	WHY....GOD WHY???: I can't believe that this song came on the top of the list and his great "Original Sin" single from 2002 didn't even reach top 20. This song isn't disaster, but it is one of his weakest and it isn't even Elton's composition. If you wanna this song, buy then "Complete Thom Bell Sessions" album. There is also "Three way Love Affair" on it.This is sweet repetitive disco song with too much sugar on it. Not disaster, but certanly not one of his best at all.
0	DO Not Buy, Do Not Buy: I read a lot of negative reviews about the purchase of high end, expensive perfumes at Amazon Website; however, since this one was being sold by amazon.com itself, I decided to take a risk. I am extremely disappointed with this purchase. The fragrance is so subtle that even a person standing one foot away cannot appreciate it------------and that is immediately after putting it on! Complete waste of money.
1	Steve Au: This pacifier was the best part of my son's Halloween costume. We got so many compliments on it. It is so much easier than putting a baby in a goofy costume they don't want to be in.
1	last recordng by the best sax player of his generation: The best sax player of his generation joined by one of the best pianists ever. This is Getz last recording, and some of his solos are almost unbearably sad. His lyrical inventiveness was never greater though. Getz doesn't embellish the original melody in his solos. He makes comletely new ones of even greater beauty. Here they are often plaintive and full of pain. Jazz artists rarely display this sort of emotional openess. But Getz's technnical skills and Romantic imagination turn all this into high art. Barron, of course, is simply the best jazz pianist around. Together they have produced a truly great album.
1	Love it.: I got this as a used product and got a good deal for it.The movie plays as good as new. I like the whimsicalnature of this movie.
0	unbalanced: This is an unbalanced view of the so-called AIDS epidemic in South Africa. Thabo Mbeki put his reputation on the line to challenge the AIDS orthodoxy. For his reactionary intransigence he is marked with pejorative epithets like denialist. He is vilified and demonized. He refuses to accept that the health of South Africans is declining because of their sexual behaviour, not poverty and underdevelopment. He opposes pushing toxic drugs on pregnant woman and their babies. This honest and hard working leader deserves recognition. There are fair and balanced books on the South African AIDS epidemic, this book is not among them.Errare humanum est sed diabolicum perseverare....
1	These are gorgeous!: I would expect to pay 6 times more for these lovely earrings in a boutique shop!I have received compliments on them everytime I've worn them!Beautiful!
0	Disappointing: The text of this book is some eighty pages, which appear to be a very bare-bones summary of various theories of learning, often with charts inserted from other books, with very few examples or guidelines as to how one would actually implement any of those ideas. You really just get an academic summary of these ideas with virtually no context or elaboration. I would recommend you rather go directly to the work of the Israeli educationalist Feuerstein (see the book by Sharron and Coulter, Changing Children's Minds), and that of Stanley Greenspan (numerous books), which seem to be the key works reflected in this all-too-brief book
0	Too Small: This brooch is far too small and expensive for its size. I was shocked when I pulled it out of its pouch. May I iterate, it is far too small. Without a moment's hesitation this brooch was immediately returned.
1	Great price fast shipping: I odered standard shipping on sunday and they got here on wednessday great deal all together it was like 4.05 for 24 of the condoms they come in the blue color i thought they were going to be in a silver package but it doesnt mate. They look great cant wait to try them
0	gets dry very quickly: this condom gets dry very quickly. One needs extra lubricant. People who give favorable review on this condom have not tried better condoms.
0	very very bad customer service and a totally rib off!!!: I have ordered 20 of12 okamoto crown condoms, the total price for the comdoms is a little over 30 dollors, but they charge me overm 90 for the shipping!! It is much more expensive than the pirce I can buy in the retails stores! They charge the pircie as 20 different shippment but they ship me as one package (very light and small). I thought that was one order, but they charge me as 20 orders. I guess the shipment only cost them less than10 dollors (grand shipping by post office), what a rib off!!
0	it breaks easier: be careful, when using this. This is super thin. It will break if your gf is not wet enough.warning!
1	Exelent, real diference: the condoms look really small, but, once you put on are really confortable. Maybe if you're a horse (more than 8" or 9")it's not going to work for you but if you're in the range 6"-8" it's ok. The feeling improove in about a15% and you can feel it!. I totally recomended. 4 stars beacause any condom it's perfect.
1	Album of the Millenium.....so far!: First things first. Buy this record - you will not be disappointed. Pete Wylie is without doubt the most criminally ignored pop genius plying his trade today, bar none. A gifted songwriter, soaring tunesmith, motor-mouthed tub-thumping wit who can raise the hairs on the back of your kneck at will. If "A Word to the Wiseguy" was his political rant, his "Boys from the Backstuff - the Musical", then this is his personal album, his "Blood on the Tracks" meets the E Street Shuffle produced by Phil Spector. An absolute tip-top industrial strength grade A gem.Oh, and by the way, just in case you weren't listening earlier, buy this record - you won't regret it.
1	Good Finale: This book explores the life of Olivia Winfield (a.k.a the Grandmother in Flowers in the Attic) Olivia is a 24 year "old maid" who's life is changed when the rich, aloof Malcolm Foxworth impulsively asks her to marry him. But upon arrival to her new home she discovers that she is only there to give birth to an heir. THis is a well-written book which tells you how someone so nice can turn into someone so evil, but I took off a star for the glaring errors that pepper this book.
1	Weird, But Good Book: Strange things definitely happen in this book, like Olivia staying married to Malcolm, when she definitely had the means to leave. Locking Alicia away for something that was not her fault was another strange thing about this book. Overall, it is a good book with a lot of twists and keeps you guessing.
1	The prequel to Flowers in the Attic: If you've always wondered why the grandmother in Flowers in the Attic was so mean, this book is for you. This is Olivia Foxworth's story of how it all began. A great novel, one of my favorties!
0	shirt fine company is a junk mailer: Shirt arrive in good condition BUT the company filled my mailbox with junk mail so much so that I had to out a block on anythig that came from them
0	Very disappointing: As a big fan of Rimsky Korsakov's operas (I have at least one audio recording of all of his operas and am collecting the DVDs as they slowly come along), I was looking forward to this production of May Night. I was disappointed. The recorded sound is poor (distant) and the production itself - sets and costumes - is quite odd.For me, decoding the action required a libretto with stage directions and fortunately a complete libretto came with the1994 Saison Russe recording.We have been fortunate to have some of Rimsky's operas show up in good to excellent DVD productions: Le Coq d'Or, Sadko, Mlada, Tsar's Bride. Even the quirky and drastically cut Tsar Saltan of Harry Kupfer is wonderful in comparison to this newest entry. Let's hope a good Kitezh or Snow Maiden comes along at some point.
0	Poor Graphics, Cheap animation.: This game is addicting, but the graphics are disaterous, and the sound clips like mad, maybe it's just my computer but the game seems to be pretty lame and pointless. (BTW I have a PIII 900MHZ, 512MB DDRAM)
1	Worthy Software Game!: When I looked at this game without opening it, I thought to myself it reminded me of Roller Coaster Tycoon. The graphics are very detailed and wonderful! I tried and game out. Let me tell you, if you love RollerCoaster Tycoon, you will adore this game!You can build secure exhibits so people can see animals like the elephant, penguin, and sea lion. But be careful. If you don't have a strong enough fence or a fence monkies can't climb out of, or your animals can escape and terrorize your guests!There are many buildings to add to the fun like a Japanese Garden or Animal Show.So all together, the gameplay is pretty much the same as RollerCoaster Tycoon, only this is a zoo instead of a themepark. =o)
1	ZooTycoon Rocks!!: Zoo Tycoon is the best computer game i've ever had! It keeps me busy for hours and I never get bored. With expansion packs it's even more fun. I would suggest it for anyone who likes animals and is interested in zoos. You also learn about animals and what they like in their exhibits. The graphics are really good and the sounds are cool too. It's a little hard when you start out but it gets easier. It's the best game ever!
1	Works fine at half the price: The picture for this shows a totally black tire, but the sidewalls are tan. However that matches what I had and I bought two for only a little more that what one would cost at the local Trek dealer. It was easy to install with no tools and works well so far.
1	No kidding: My dog ate this book the first day we left her alone in the same room with it. Seriously.
0	Don't be fooled!: The cover shows a cute, silly picture of a dog. I was expecting greeting card type goofy pictures and captions. The pictures were okay, the captions were tasteless, sick and far from funny. What a waste.
1	Dain Curse in full: Love the quality of the movieI have a high def wide screen tvwent to the ROOT MENUthe audio had an echo like the sound in a movie theatreAdjusted the audio from Theatre to Living Room and that corrected the musicBUT I still got the echo on my tv for the talkingI played it on my computer--and worked very wellI will have to deal with my tv later! It readjusted the whole tv system.Ah the good old days before HD and all that jazz!There must be a sound adjustment I haven't adjusted yet.
1	Excellent Resource: I have used many of the team challenges in this book in my work in youth ministry and public education. There are ideas for everything from ice-breakers to large group challenges that are very effective for building community and encouraging people to work together toward a common goal while having fun at the same time. While some of the ideas require more complex props, many can be done with items you have readily available around the house or office. All of the ideas would work as effectively with youth or adults in a variety of settings. Best of all, the text is written in Rohnke's witty style that makes reading about the games almost as fun as playing them.
0	AWEFUL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!: these earings are the worst! they are way too heavy and the rocks on the bottom weent the same color! on was grey and one was black! I dont recommend this!
0	Helpful but full of mistakes: Although this pocketbook is helpful for beginners it has one big mistake: phrases and words are written in Amharic letters (which is a good thing) but the authors were really careless when they proofread the book. In many cases the word (or phrase) written in Amharic does not correspond to it's English translation ... which leads to misunderstandings as soon as one uses the book for nonverbal communication (and that was the idea behind the usage of amharic letters)!
0	Kindle Version Must Be Beta: Whoever digitized this book was not paying attention. There are header lines (title and author)in the middle of the screen, text lines end in the middle, page numbers appear in the middle of paragraphs.I like this author and would, perhaps, enjoy this story if there weren't so many distractions due to poor editing. Save your money until someone fixes this version!
0	what can I use to upgrade...???: I have office 4.2.1 will this count as an upgrade???? I don't want to buy this and find out that it won't! I hate office, but love entourage and if I qualify for the upgrade, it's actually cheaper than buying entourage on its own!
0	DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY: DESPITE READING THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS, I BOUGHT IT ANYWAY. THE WEIGHT PART WAS OK, BUT I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH THE AEROBICS PART OF THE TAPE. DANCE STEPS TOO HARD TO FOLLOW, CAMERA ANGLES BAD. BORING...TO MUCH YELLING IN BACKGROUND.
0	There is more "Bad" about this DVD than just Religion.: This DVD has VERY terrible sound and VERY low budget video footage. The only good thing is it has alot of songs, and the riot is somewhat interesting. Bad Religion is a good band, but this DVD is awful!! :(You will feel ripped off if you buy this!! Borrow it first, if you can, before buying it!!! I guess this DVD could always be used as an expensive cup coaster.
0	Disappointed - they tricked me: I feel cheated in some way. I heard Jack Blades and Tommy Shaw on The Howard Stern Show playing ACOUSTIC versions of these songs. I liked the sound a lot. Then I bought the CD and found that none of the songs on the CD are acoustic at all.I'm a big Jack Blades and Tommy Shaw fan otherwise I wouldn't have purchased the CD at all, but these songs are really just cheap karaoke versions of great songs. Shaw-Blades bring nothing new to them. The sound is VERY watered down. Like Muzak in an elevator. My advice would be to just buy the original versions of these songs as performed by the original artists.I'll show mercy and give it two stars (which it doesn't deserve) because I did like California Dreamin' (although even with that one give me the original).Shame on you Shaw-Blades, are you really that hard up for money at this point in your career that you need to release a karaoke CD ?
1	Truely awsome: Ralph Towner has got to be one of the finest guitarists thathas ever lived. This live album is spectacular. I have hadthe great fortune of seeing Ralph perform live on severaloccasions in the1970's: solo, with Oregon, and with thePaul Winter Consort. His performances were nothing butawe inspiring! This album is a masterpiece and its LIVE!
1	great A/V RECIEVER: my second yamaha A/V reciever my first was A 2nd from top rxv-2090 it came out on the fringe of home theatre it had a excelent amp but a little out of date as far as home theatredecoding beeing its based on 5 channels not 5.1knowing i needed a updated after hearing my girl friends get this! 300$ home theatre in a box i realized while my 2090 sounded better the timming was better on her cheep system . Still I am surprised at how much better the HTR-5590 sounded my first dolbly digital movie blew my mind don't forget i had a1500$1995 model yamaha witch was very good too ,i would give it a 4.5 but no option for it here
0	Unimpressed: The book has a lot of detailed step by step information on how the author runs his consulting business; however, he comes across as a greedy egomaniac. I was unimpressed. One chapter in the book suggests developing passive income like writing books. I was upset that I bought this books to feed this man's ego and revenue stream. Consider the Patrick Lencioni book series instead.
1	A breath of fresh air!: This album is by far one of the best underground albums I've ever heard. It is a very unique blend of Russian/gypsy style music and good ole rock'n'roll. The magic created by this Colorado band is a wonderful breath of fresh air in the mostly stagnant popular music scene of the last few years. I challange anyone to listen to this album and NOT be dancing their all over the place!
1	Good product, good value: I recently bought two pair of these noise cancelling headphones to replace earlier headphones we had bought from Radio Shack. We wanted to upgrade quality while not going through the roof in price. I did a fair amount of online research and decided to buy the well regarded PXC 300s and am not disappointed at all. My wife and I use these for traveling. We travel overseas and try to be pretty light, so the ability to fold up and become quite compact was a strong plus. Comfortable to wear - not too much pressure on the head. Good noise suppression. I'm sure that we would get better fidelity (and bulk) with Bose, but at barely $100 per pair these are an excellent choice.
1	Outstanding noise canceling: I use these both in airline travel and at the gym. The noise canceling feature functions well in airplanes. In the the gym, it blocks nearly all the other noises and helps block the pain of exercise.
1	Noise Cancelling Earphones: Ease of use - excellentBattery life- lasted a flight to/from Hawaii and still in useDecreased cabin noise - good (nothing else to compare it to)Sound quality - very goodPrice - not as expensive as Bose
0	Couldn't even finish this one: I totally agree with the other one star reviewers. I only fought part-way through the book before I pushed it aside in disgust. While a fiction work, the main character is supposed to give you a sense of who John was. The book portrays him as a hot-headed legalistic old man, quick to anger, cowardly, and needing to be led by those he had mentored. Where are his fruits of the Spirit? Where is the wisdom he would have from walking with the Master all those years? The words he spoke in the book were drivel. If you want a good fiction book to read (sorry I can't vouch for the historical accuracy) try Francine Rivers Mark of the Lion series. It's a three part series. I highly recommend the first two books.
1	Mixing historical with fictional fill-in interesting: Book of John is my favorite of the Gospel accounts of Jesus Christ's ministry on earth. I like the mix of what is historically known about the apostle John with the fictional story to fill in and make an interesting read. Then The Gospel of John and the 3 Epistles written by John are also included at the end of the book.Have also read the other "Jesus Chronicles" by same authors about Matthew, Mark, and Luke. I recommend all of them.Love being able to download books to the Kindle App on my Toshiba Thrive Tablet.
1	Great: This book is in great shape no missing pages hardly any damage. I am very happy with the service I received, I will be a returning customer.
0	Don't expect to pass the exam!!: I have read the first book out of the four (Windows 2000 Professional (70-210). Studied it inside and out. Took the sample test in the CD-ROM and got 98% on it. I thought I was ready for the exam so I went and took the 70-210 exam. Well, this book did not even come close to what the exam was like. The questions were much, much harder and longer scenerio type. I did not pass the exam. If you are looking to just learn Windows 2000 Professional really well, then these books are good. If you are looking to take the MCSA or MCSE exams then don't count on these books to help you pass.
0	Really Poor Product, maybe it was just mine: The reviews were great on this products, that is why I bought it.But when received mine in the mail and tried it out, It was completely useless, I think the worst10 Dollars I have ever spent.It would not grip any hair of mine, the quality felt very poor, I had better experiences with tweezers from Walmart.Really disappointed.
1	The tweezer of tweezers: This tweezer is the epitome of what a tweezer should be. It even comes with a little storage case. Can't wait for my next splinter...
0	Tweezerman Mini Slant Tweezer: I do not like the slant Tweezers, they do not grip little hairs properly. Much prefer the straight tip and also the scissors type, which appear to be unobtainable at present. Not a happy chappy!
1	A good book for those with experiance with x86 assembly: This book does not serve as a tutorial to learn assembly; rather it goes into many uses of assembly, such as reverse engineering, and protection from a virus. If you know assembly already, and want to use it more effectively, this would be a good book
1	Worth it..: Explains how to view education in terms of the whole person. There are also people you can meet who can help you follow this approach. This is the real genius of the author: he not only wrote well but there are people who he has educated in this way and who are available to get to know.
1	If you plan to purchase only one Nelons release, this is it.: This has become my favorite southern gospel tape. The group has made full use of the members' vocal talents. The result is a blend of soaring harmonies, and little twists and turns, that will have you placing your ear next to the player in order not to miss a single note!
0	On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection ...: The true title that Darwin gave this thesis is: "On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life." Amazon.com makes no mention of this. Darwin believed that the peoples of Africa were inferior.
1	This smells good!: You only THINK it's a kid's scent. But this stuff is MANLY. It's a bit citrusy, kinda spicy... I get compliments on it all the time. Seriously, buy this. I can't recommend it enough.
1	Addendum.: Mistaking the trees for the wood, I forgot to mention the most important aspect of Bresson's last masterpiece, 'L'Argent': one of the greatest shots in all cinema. In the immediate aftermath of a domestic murder, blood flecked on dully garish wallpaper is briefly illumined by a fallen lampshade before it's extinguished. Shattering.
1	Resonant.: This isn't on the level of Kangaroo Jack or Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle, but it'll do.
0	horrible: Purchased because it was a good price and was comfortable for baby. Regret completely. The crotch latch is so short and uncomfortable for baby. Worst problem was trying to remove the pad for cleaning. Out of three carseats owned, this is the WORST to clean and put back together. Horrible!
0	Don't waste your money: Don't waste your money. Not worth the time to download much less the purchase price. When it does start, the display doesn't refresh properly and the screen fills up with garbage and you can't see what is happening on the screen.
1	Great show!: I used to live in New Orleans and remember seeing the crews filming this show all around my neighborhood. It's a great show with a great cast...and, most importantly, a great tribute to New Orleans!
1	The Death Committiee: A gripping in depth story which historically records the training and emotional depth of those who choose to become key players in the medical community.A must read which will jar your emotions and expose the drama the determination and dedication of those who want to be contributors in the medical revolution.
0	Not happy with this: The whole point of going wireless was the move the computer to a spot I could see on the bike, but to finally get this to work it was almost on the tire itself and even a shorter distance than the wired unit that I had. Went to using my iPhone and a free app on that to track all my information, it worked out better than anything I tried. Ended up giving this unit away.
0	Poor quality: This product came with 2 pieces that are warped - so the oven door closes too far and the fridge door won't close all the way. The stove / sink top piece is split and the screw holes for the faucet were drilled too small.I would not recommend.
0	Disappointing video.: I must admit I was quite disappointed with this video. The video is advertised as a collection of period car commercials and promotional films. It is that indeed.My problem with the video is that the commercials and short promos are all of mundane subject matter. There are no classic commercials or promos of the performance models, the rare trim levels, the more desirable luxury models. As an example, one promo was about the (relative) fuel economy of the Chevrolet Impala compared to it's Ford and Chrysler competitors in which each car had a glass container mounted on the hood showing how much fuel was left as each car drove along a test track. This is not exactly what I would call an interesting classic car commercial.The segment on the Corvair was okay, so I gave this two-stars. Overall, to me, this wasn't worth the money unless one is interested in how many shopping bags can be put into the trunk of a Dodge Polara compared to others in its class.
1	Too Complex: I am a long time US Robotics Pilot1000 to Palm V user who has been thrilled with the battery life and utter simplicity of the palm series. This device doesn't even come close on the basic aspect of calendar entry or viewing. The day/week/month chooser on the palm is always on the calender screen. With iPaq it is always at least two clicks away. Neither one will allow greater that1/2 hr apptments that are clearly distinguished. The screen however, just absolutely leave Palm in the dust.... If Palm Vc was out with the screen on the iPaq I would have bought it a year ago....However, it will virtually always eliminate one of Palms other big attractions and that is either the loooong life of very simple and inexpensive batteries.
1	parts purchase: Kudos to the guys that helped me purchase this part. I had been through many local parts stores and everyone had me waiting many days or weeks even and alot more pricey. I will definitely go to these guys again and I highly recommend them!
0	Typical 80's T & A: I remember back as a teenager watching "A Current Affair" when Maury Povich was still the host. There was a story on this very movie because the opening scene was filmed at a high school and consisted of 20 or so scantilly clad women and a voluptuous teacher that greeted the hero with the line, "Is that an apple in your pocket or are you just glad to see me?" Obviously, this was a dream sequence, but nontheless, I think that alone was worth the $3.00 I paid for this movie. The rest is pretty much mind-numbing.
0	Not happy: I thought it was advanced poses. Instead it was some kind of breathing! It was a waste of my money.
1	Worth Listening To: The early years of Tangerine Dream produced some incredible music. Although Mirage lacks some of the drama of Schulze in the Tangerine Dream days, it is a very competent effort that makes for pleasant listening.After listening to this album, you can start to identify Schulze's contribution to Tangerine Dream, and also the musical personality of Klaus Schulze himself.
1	the BEST for many reasons: This performance is one of my favorites in a large collection of dance videos. Not only for the dancers and choreography, but the music, too.
1	great package!: This package is definately worth the price. I got it for my palm and couldn't stop playing it. If you are ever bored in meetings or just sitting around the house, this is a great way to have some fun. Me and my kids love it. It is just like the shooting games at the arcade. I would definately recommend it. If you liked this one I would also recommend the100 great games for the palm.
1	Undiscovered Treasure: I believe Shirley Horn and this CD are an undiscovered treasure. Well into her seventies and not recently in the best of health, Ms. Horn is a national treasure for jazz lovers. While she barely sings above a whisper, her emotion,timing and phrasing are on par with Sinatra--heady company indeed. This album showcases her vocal and piano skills in a golden light.Combined with the lush overlay of Johnny Mandel's beautiful string arrangements, this is a truly glorious cd that stays with you. Rarely have I seen a CD described on Amazon in such universally passionate and glorious terms.
0	Shirley Horn, "Here's To Life": There is only one word for this CD - - -DELICIOUS ! ! ! ! Went back and bought two more for friends. They agreed with me. ENJOY
1	Lippincott: This is a thick book with tons of information. Guaranteed to help out any nursing student or even just a good book to have as a nurse. However, it is hard to navigate this book, it takes some looking around before you can figure it out.
1	Highland 91338 Triple Strength Bungee Cord Assortment: So far very good set. Wish they had more that were the same size in the set but the quality of the cords has been very good
0	I'm glad this was free.: If I had had to pay for this, I'd be returning it. Impractical and old-fashioned, with ingredients I've never heard of or have no way of finding. Mace? Turtle? REALLY?
0	Helen Fisher's "Final Solution": This book makes it clear that Helen Fisher hates men. If a man wrote a book like this from the male perspective, he would be justly crucified by the media. This book is a blow to the good reputation of the Anthropology Department at Rutgers University, where she was apparently employed at the time of publication. I would like to say something positive about the book, in order to balance out some of the negatives, but I can't think of anything except maybe that it is a good addition to the library of anyone who collects the works of notable bigots. In short, a truly horrible book.
0	can you say CREEPY: Let me say that I had never heard of Diane Arbus before watching this movie. In a nutshell, She meets the stranger living in the attic of her apartment bldg who has a medical condition that makes his appearance that of a werewolf. He is just as creepy as she is. She falls "madly" in love with him, takes up photography with the majority of her photos being that of his hallway and front door (yes thats right), neglects her family and becomes weirdly obsessed with her hairy lover. Strange movie. I found it disturbing.
0	What's the Point?: First of all, why make a film that is an "imaginary portrait" of Diane Arbus? It consists of a made-up story about Arbus and a neighbor with a medical condition that makes him hairy all over. Kidman, of course, is wonderful, Robert Downey, Jr. is very disappointing, and ultimately the viewer is disappointed too. I suppose Arbus' real life story wasn't interesting enough.
0	In-fur-iating: This movie is really quite unfortunate. Diane Arbus was a fascinating woman and her life should have gotten the treatment it deserved. They had been debating for years about how best to approach this... what won out was probably the worst idea. It is fictional and only loosely based on her amazing life. It is pretty insulting to her memory. The fictional allegorical love affair with her upstairs neighbor is kind of insulting for it portrays her as a naive woman needing a masculine figure to bring out her artistic notions. The character itself pays homage to Lionel the Lion-Faced man and imagines a meeting/romance. They even change her kid's names for no reason. I hope another film does it right.
1	Keeps 4yo son busy: It was easy enough for my son to figure out and keep him occupied during long car rides.
0	Another "Poor little Women" novel....: Gina and Lawrence are the main characters of the book. The were best friends in childhood and that friendship continues into adulthood. Both are married to other people and when Gina's marriage ends she ends up in at Lawrences house being comforted in his arms. His wife is somewhat understanding but feels that Gina often outstays her welcome. Gina goes through every "poor me" emotion from the divorce and it gets obnoxiously annoying! Will someone please write a book where the betrayed women moves on and becomes strong without having to virtually distroy her teenage childrens' lives too?!!!I won't go into detail of what happens next in case you decide to read this boring novel but let's just say that it's predictable, yet boring, with no really likeable characters. Very flatly written! I give it 2 stars...
0	Why would anyone pay to have an ad: Especially one this uninformative, in their cubicle. I would be reluctant to TAKE money to put up this poster.
0	The Vice Season Two a disappointment: Season One of The Vice was just terrific. Good writing and, of course, Ken Stott is a fine actor. But Season Two moves like molasses, certainly the first two episodes. Endless, dragging, repetitive, no action. The writers sadly appear to have let the series down. Here's to hoping they regain their initial touch.
0	Natural Selection among people: ----------- -----------1) The mechanism of natural selection among people explained:"the races or species of men, whichever term may be applied, encroach on and replace one another, so that some finally become extinct"2) The way this encroachment until extinction occurs among people:"Extinction follows chiefly from the competition of tribe with tribe,and race with race. (...) when of two adjoining tribes one becomes less numerous and less powerful than the other, the contest is soon settled by war, slaughter, cannibalism, slavery, and absorption."3) The morality of Darwinism:"The highest possible stage in moral culture is when we recognise that we ought to control our thoughts, and "not even in inmost thought to think again the sins that made the past so pleasant to us."1,2,3 those are the main things in the book in my opinion. It fails on standards of systemacy, abstraction, exactitude, verification, logic/reasoning, neutrality and formalising of theory.
0	Very week book: How this got printed I dont know. Wish I could have seen samples of the tutorials before I purchased online. (...)
0	A comparison of two books...: I purchased both the Princeton Review and the Kaplan GRE1999-2000 edition book. I found that while the Princeton Review book had some good pointers, the Kaplan book was better organized and a lot easier (for me at least) to study from. If you're only going to buy one book, I'd suggest passing this one up and getting the Kaplan book.What really sold me on Kaplan was the fact that they divided up their list of vocab words into categories, instead of one big list.
1	A Superb Textbook!: Death, Society, and the Human Experience is a wonderful textbook! I have been using it in my class The Sociology of Death and Dying for the past four years. This book provides the information necessary to any real understanding and examination of societal assumptions and attitudes toward death and dying. It not only enhances the knowledge of the student but provides the groundwork for new readers in the field. The book is a beautiful presentation of stimulating facts that will help everyone confront death and dying in a more personal and lasting manner.
1	Five Stars: Excellent Service. Unit installed easily and worked perfectly like factory original. I would highly recommend this company for all your door opener needs.
1	Love them: These floor mats are very durable and fit perfectly in our truck. Living in back country with the mud and snow they have held up perfectly. Would recommend to everyone.
1	Indiana Jones and the Dance of the Giants: I am a 62 year-old kid who can't get enough of Indy (young or old, and whatever comes next). MacGregor's, Dance of the Giants is well written, with plenty of history,archeologial sites and adventure to suit me. That is, of course, if one can really have enough adventure. These little stories read very fast, so I try to read them slow and savor every page. I highly reccommend the Indiana Jones Series of books.
1	A Peruvian Portrait of Ordinary Lives: Written 50 years ago, this uniquely-styled novel, with multi-page single paragraph passages apparently used to render community scenes in a unified format seems to me to be a kind of impressionist painting in words, sliding fluidly between a smallish back country city on the edge of the desert and an island village in the upper reaches of the Amazon, with a motley population of mostly poor but proud peasants and indians, some living by smuggling contraband, others by the central elaborate [...] house where an old harp player leads a combo of local musicians. The hopes and fears, successes and failures, of the protagonists translate neither to heroes nor villains, and sad or happy events follow each other in timeless progression. The respected writer produced subsequent superior works, but this difficult effort still deserves patronage.
0	What's Her Problem?: I read this book and it's obvious that Eartha Kitt has a problem with being black. She claims that the reason they didn't show the movie she was in with Sammy Davis Jr. in the South, was because the racist Southerners might believe she was white. If Eartha Kitt thinks that she would be mistaken for white, then excuse me, but this is the Queen of England typing this review.
0	Another Scam: I was ok with ordering this inexpensive mask for my son because I thought it would come with the tinted glass that is shown, because that's all he really wants. It's unfortunate that these fly by night paintball companies take advantage of people advertising one product but actually delivering another. Last time I order anything from this company.
1	an all time great...: To many hamsun readers this one will seem to be quite a departure for Hamsun, as it is an urban tale centering around a bohemian clique, rather than the usual tale of the Norwegian peasantry. As I know only those that are already Hamsun fans will ever read this, let it suffice to say that this book is as good as any of his works (even Pan), so hurry up and get a copy...
1	Unsurpassed "Milkwood": Richard Burton, Elizabeth Taylor, and Peter O'Toole bring Dylan Thomas's lyrical masterpiece to life. The lilting and hilarious verse roles from the actors like wonderful music. Even one who did not understand English would appreciate the musical joy of the recording.The performance captures the hilarity and the pathos of Thomas's portrait of human life and love.This is a near definitive version of the play and should be part of the collection of any lover of Dylan Thomas's exquisite language.
1	Great little product: I bought this little toy at a local auto mart and it has saved the day. It holds the charge for weeks and has never failed me in jumpstarting a car. I leave it in my wife's car during the winter months in case her battery doesn't start and it works great.Definitely a high recommendation.
0	poor construction for terminals: Seems ok at first, charged fine as advertised. Used it 3 times in the first day i had it charged (lucky timing!) and the negative terminal connector flew apart each time. Had to reassemble each time and it still is shakey. Very frustrating in that attaching to anything of any size causes it to self-destruct. Now I've taken to just holding it on to something a la a defribulator and hoping for the best. Would not buy again.
0	Poor product: I have had 2 faulty units right out of the box. The first would not hold a charge for more than a couple of days and that did not improve after cycling the battery a number of times. I returned it for a replacement and that 2nd unit never indicated a full charge - even after being on charge for several days. I am moving on to another brand.Don't waste your time and money on these poor quality items.
1	Chevrolet Inline Six-Cylinder Power Manual: I found this book to be very informative and easy to understand. I had been looking for sometime, for any information reguarding the chevrolet inline six cylinders, 250 and 292. It really help me with the knowledge and unstanding of this inline six cylinder motor, that i find to be very inpressive and highly underated by most small block V-8 chevy motor heads. I just wish I could have found this book long before I finished building my motor. But that's ok, I already have plans for the next motor and I will be refering to this book when building torque and horsepower.
1	True story of1st stages of struggle to free Soviet Jews.: His history and outline of the JDL ideology should be read by every Jew--whether or he or her agrees with Kahane.Read especially what he says about Jabotinsky.
1	You're nuts if you don't have this book in your library!: One of the finest books on Hollywood's master photographer, George Hurrell. The author not only is an expert in his own right, but he knew Hurrell. That special blend along with the fact the author knows how to write and chose some wonderful never seen before photos makes this book one very satisfying bedtime meal. Great reading
1	A Peek at the Glamour that Once Was: Hurrell's art is amazing. The actors who were defined by his photography owed him their careers. He made each one of them look as if they stepped out of a dream. He was trudly remarkable in his craft.
0	buyer beware!: The "search inside" feature of this ad shows gorgeous, color photographs of the birds; HOWEVER, the actual book's photos are in black and white! Admittingly, the photos here are more accurate than Dover's older version's drawings, but you will still need to refer to another source for color photos/drawings. If you already own an older copy, don't bother with this one! If you are buying for the first time, you will appreciate the large, clear photos, but know that they are all in black and white.Spacing of the text is another problem I have with this publisher's version. The lines of text are too close together for easy reading. Dover's version is easier on the eyes.
1	happy customer: I am a very satisfied customer. The shipment was received extremely fast! The hat is in perfect condition. No complaints. Thanks!
1	Wonderful Book: I bought this book because I had read 'So You Want to Be a Wizard' (the first book in the series to which this book is the sixth) when I was in elementary school, and for nostalgia's sake, I wanted to read the whole series. The book came in perfect condition (save a few dings in the softcover from shipping). It was well worth the money!!
1	Insightful and Interesting: This book is about a social worker , who after years of helping others, must save herself from the grip of manic depression. Her struggle to get her life back together after a manic episode will touch your heart. The author shows a great deal of insight in sharing the many ways mental illness has touched her life and the lives of her family members. Overall the book is emotionally powerful, informative and well written.
1	I agree, Joshy Hell is an Idiot: Inspired by the below review, I also wanted to chime in an call Icy Hell an idiot. I will definitely buy this album (maybe 2 copies) and revel in the mainstream tones
1	Good Light - Better for "being seen": I think this is a great set - the lights are small and easy to install (the rear light easily fits on my Topeak rack), but these lights are better for being seen than seeing. That's great for the rear light: it does its job well. But the front light could use a little more horsepower if you intend on lighting the way.
1	A gentle soul was Vincent Van Gogh: Stone takes the reader on a fascinating journey recapping Vincent Van Gogh's life of hardships and triumphs in his biographical novel Lust for Life. Beginning in London, the author reveals Vincent's inner core as a young man of twenty-one working as a clerk for European art dealers while falling madly in love with a vivacious nineteen-year-old kindergarten teacher. Vincent's reaction to this unrequited relationship establishes a pattern of behavior and insight into his personality, which makes him more empathetic as a character. Vincent leaves London and embarks on journey in search of his "true calling" and ends up as a minister living in abject poverty in a Belgium miners' village. This situation strengthens his character and weakens his faith, but out of that grows a passion for art and drawing. The obsession begins and so does his real journey. This book is well worth reading.
1	AN ARTIST'S LIFE: IRVING STONE HAS HIS READERS RELIVE VINCENT VAN GOGH'S LIFE.AFTER READING THE BOOK YOU CAN EASILY APPRECIATE THE TUMULTOUS LIFE THIS ARTIST HAD.THE AURTHOR HAS USED CERTAIN FICTIONAL MOMENTS AS HE AGREES TO IN THE END.THESE ONLY MAKE THE BOOK MORE READWORTHY.THE EMPHASIS IN THIS BOOK IS ON THE LIFE OF VINCENT VAN GOGH IN RELATION TO THE ART HE PRODUCED.ONE OF MY PERSONAL FAVOURITES.
0	Buyer Beware!!! Rain haven!: We have had this sandbox for about a year and it is constantly filling with rain water. Flimsy lid does not fit correctly and Little Tikes will do nothing without a dated receipt within1yr - basically told us too bad. Buy the Step 2!!!
1	Obsessive Genius: It was a wonderful biography of Marie Curie and very interesting but there were times I got lost in all the technology and chemistry of it. I would rate it a 41/2 but the stars above wouldn't let me rate it that way. What an amazing woman and what amazing accomplishments and contributions she made especially in that time.
1	AWESOME: Just got this sub to replace my sony 8 inch sub. I plugged this sub in, put on a cd and this thing rocks. The lows hit so low and sound awesome with my Klipsch Quintet SL Home Theater System. If you are looking for a great sub for movies and music then GET THIS SUB! You will not be disappointed.
0	Where are the sources?: This book is fantasy. It uses very few sources to support crucial elements and hypothesis and boils down to a delusional opinion of a Right Wing conspiracy theorist. The author refuses to debate this material because it is far fetched and unrealistic and it should **NOT** be taken seriously. It uses eyewitnesses who were in Nanking as sources when they agree with the author; however then when those sources refute the author's opinion, they are cast out. Read this if you want to know how NOT to conduct serious historical research. The author should be labeled as a right wing fanatic and illusionist; this should be listed under "fantasy/fiction".
0	revisionist history at its worst: According to this book there was no Rape of Nanking ,it was all Nationalist Chinese propaganda. The book is just not true, it presents a lot of facts but ignores others.It doesent read well
0	very poor quality: I purchased this item a few months ago and just took it out of the box for my daughter born the end of November...well all the padding has completely broken down and flaked all over!!!! I now have a complaint against combi pending and now must purchase a new seat because i will not put her in this one!!!!!!!!!do not purchase!!!!! who only knows what the material is made of( it was made in Italy)less then1 star
0	How to Show Your Own Dog: Fortunately this book is currently out of print, and should stay that way. The illustrations and pictures throughout the book date back to the late fifties and sixties. No where in the book does MS Nichols discuss in any detail the finer points of actually showing your purebred dog. To her benefit she did a very good job of depicting what it is like to attend a dog show and how champions earn their pionts. Unfortunatly, most of this information is not laid out in any organized manner. At times I felt like I was having a friendly cup of coffee as she skipped from one thought to another. Her biggest inside tip under the chapter "Tricks of the Trade" was "Keep your nose clean, your eyes and ears open, and your mouth closed until you know what it is all about." Good advice since you won't learn what showing your own dog is about from this source.
1	You have to see this Sherlock Holmes Film ... !!!: This one had escaped me ... you cannot believe the Actor who played Minister of Magic ... Fudge was it ... in the Harry Potter Series ... I never liked him in Harry Potter because he was so fake and luke warm (wishy washy) ... BUT you will loathe him in this film - a nasty evil sort of dude - causing more uneasiness because of the psycholigical nature of his crimes ... you'd have more sympathy for him if he ran around shooting people ... not that that's good either .... he really makes a mean blackmailer. The only movie I've ever liked him in was Sense & Sensibility.
0	Pigs at the Trough: This was a very poorly written book. It was repetitive, rambling and boring. I suspect she had someone write it to make money.
0	too little details, too much sarcasm: First of all, 20% of the words in this book seem to be devoted to sarcasm- it was funny at first but then became tiresome. The book follows the pattern of telling you what's wrong, who's guilty, and how much money that person sucked from the American taxpayer. Personally I'm more interested in the details of the loopholes. How do offshore tax havens work? How do corporate lobbyists operate in Washington? These details aren't available in Pigs at the Trough.
1	Riotous: Mercifully, Arianna injects enough humor into this book to keep the reader out of the inevitable funk that would come from the revelations inside. Well done.
1	No-nonsense truth from a no-nonsense woman: Arianna Huffington is a rare treasure...a political pundit who states the truth without sugar coating it. She is brilliant,insightful, and she has a great sense of humor. Her writing adds some exciting life and laughter to very serious issues.This book is a must read for capitalist pigs and those that hate them.
1	Good Book for RESNET test: Took a class to become a Class1 Florida Home Rater. This book was given to every student in the class. It seems to have quality information that is put in a simple format to read.Before I took the National RESNET test(passed), I highlighted and tab the book which was very useful come test time. I also bought the Online version and up it to my web site so I could use adobe search at test time.I found the online book not to be as beneficial because I was faster using my tabs. So I would recommend the Soft book version over the Online Adobe version. I think you learn more by highlighting and tabbing an actual book too.If you plan to take the National RESNET Test then this book is a must to have.
1	Great book: This the second book I have read of his, and it was well paced and kept my interest.Plan on reading more of his work.
0	If you're a Bela fan, you will have to see it!: The Devil Bat is a real poverty row effort from the1940s, when Bela Lugosi was being offered roles of diminishing quality. That being said, it does have a certain campy charm,as Lugosi trains his electrically enlarged bats to kill at the scent of his special shaving lotion formula! The big bat has to be seen to be believed, and its attack cry is really something. All in all, a fun hour of viewing.
1	Favorite: Robin Hood was my children's all time favorite! I still sing those songs in my head. So glad we can share this with our grands.
1	It's the best: I consider this the "original" Robin Hood. I never realized as a kid that this was one of my all-time favorite movies, but as an adult I realize that it was. I LOVE the music. Classic Disney
1	Robin hood: Co worker need this movie I just ordered it for her. She has not offered any complaints of the product.
1	Decent Disney film: This film was done of course, in what I would call `Disney's Off Years".Not up to their usual standards, was not a huge hit. Could have been if improvements in script & characters.It is only a good film.Bringing Phil Harris as "Little John" & making "Little John" a bear just because of the success with1967's `The Jungle Book" "Baloo" character.ONLY a1 disc version of the film.Some extras but nothing major. No Making Of or anything like that.And, something I HATE in DVD packaging. THESE HORRIBLE CASES WITH THE LITTLE OPEN UP FLAPS!! THESE NEED TO BE DONE AWAY WITH!!
1	shimmery....fresh feeling: I had used Revlon Skinlights Instant Skin Brightener in the past... LOVED it... couldn't find it in any stores anymore so went on line... was THRILLED that I could still get it... Love it....ordered three !!! :)
0	Not the Coverage it Claims to Give: I purchased this product since I was looking to try something to cover my hyperpigmentation. I was already happy with a different product but I was trying to save a few dollars and at the same time give something else a try. I was not happy with the outcome. First of all, the product comes in a "chapstick" type of container and size so for my age spots, I have to use quite a lot of product. I used it before I applied my foundation and it just didn't give me the coverage my previous concealer did. I agree with the saying, "cheaper isn't always better" and will be going back to my previous concealer.
0	Has Charlie from Mighty Ducks: When I rented this movie, from a friend's suggestion (he said he liked it in the seventh grade so at 26, I should like it too) I dind't really know what I was going to get. Little did I know I was going to get Charlie from the Mighty Ducks. While he's not the lovable winner from the show about ice hockey, he's still the good guy and good guys win (SPOILER ALERT).
0	the worst.: Whoa boy, I've seen some pretty lame flicks last year, but The Skulls definitely comes in as one of the worst. It's a mind-bogglingly stupid tale about a pretty boy (Joshua Jackson) who stupidly decides to join a secret society, and it seems all the members of this society, called The Skulls, are pretty dumb in their own rights, too. Of course, this didn't prepare me for the lame as heck finale, which features a duel, that's right, a duel involving two flintlock pistols.
0	Who DOES this remind you of?: Lightweight film, but interesting premise. The sons of wealthy, powerful families get inducted into an Ivy League secret society. In return for a vow of mutual lifetime assistance, they get all sorts of advantages (expensive cars, grad school admissions, forgivable student loans, old boy network at the highest levels of society).Best of all, their darkest secrets are whitewashed, covered up, and forgotten.Darned if this doesn't remind us of a skull currently running for president.
0	The Skulls: I am a William L. Petersen fan, But if I had a choice on watching this video again or being bashed in the skull. I would take the skull bash thank you very much.
0	Thai Fresh Lemongrass - 8 stalks: Exactly what I wanted, will reorder when I run out. Came fresh and makes the best tea. Thank you very much..
0	how not to learn a language: I moved to spain a year ago, but in the 6 months before i left nyc i decided to take a spanish class to give me a head start.my teacher was a native spanish speaker, so i trusted his decision when he required this book. i should'nt have.i quickly realized (after 3 lessons) that you don't learn a foreign language by memorizing list of related vocabulary. i'm sure we all remember that from high school, but how many of us actually learned how to speak a language that way, no one.once in spain and entered in a school with a real book, i realized that you learn by natural assimilation of ideas. A chapter or theme might start with a silly picture or story, and go from there. as the topic is further discussed, it brings in further vocabulary in a way that is natural.memorizing lists works for no one!
1	A Great Book to have: Bought this ebook primarily because I was assigned a few of its short story in my North American Writters class. The stories are amazing, my favorite ones are "Rip Van Winkle" and of course "The Legend of Sleepy Hollow".This particular edition (The Sketch-Book of Geoffrey Crayon) was free on Amazon.com and although it is very well organized and there weren't any errors that I could find, I'm docking one star for a critical flaw on the ebook's design. The table of content is not hyperlinked, so if you just want to read a certain story instead of the whole book you need to go through the entire book "page" by "page" in order to reach your desired destination. If the table of content had been hyperlinked I would have given it the full 5 stars.
0	The Legend Of Sleepy Hollow And Other Stories: The book that I read was called The Legend Of Sleepy Hollow And Other Stories. The author of the book was Washington Irving. I thought that was book wasn't that great. That depends on if you don't mind an old-fashioned type of language that they spoke. I thought that the book was a little too complicated for me because I didn't understand what the people were saying sometimes.I thought that the actual theme of the book was pretty good, but otherwise I didn't really care for it that much.I'd reccomend this book to anyone who ever read the actual verson of Sleepy Hollow and liked the story.By,Andy C.
0	DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY: Horrible movie. I actually laughed a lot, but it's not supposed to be a comedy. The acting was terrible, storyline bad, the way the movie was shot was supposed to be "arty" but just ended up looking like a10 year old child did the camera work. I only gave it one star for a rating because they won't let you review an item without one. If they had a zero star rating, that's what it would get. I am sorry I wasted my money on it.
0	Slow and pointless: I have read several of Steinbeck's other works. They are generally good. This book, although, is slow moving and has several irrelevant chapters thrown in. The ending is definitely not what I expected.
1	Exactly what I needed: I read a review of one of these notebooks that made me think they were teeny but I was happily surprised to find that they were almost as long as my hand and fairly wide. The perfect size for a notebook to bring around with me for whenever I need to jot down a thought. I ordered a few, all of which I love, but this one is my favorite. The painting is just beautiful.
0	Read The Club Dumas instead.: I bought this book because I found The Club Dumas to be excellent. I was deeply disappointed. Where The Club Dumas sparkled, The Seville Communion merely exists, and while The Club Dumas transcended its genre, The Seville Communion is deeply rooted in it. And that's a shame, because it means the mastery exhibited in The Club Dumas is a one shot deal rather than the arrival of a major literary talent
0	Yawn: A handsome priest is sent by the Vatican to investigate mysterious goings-on in Seville, after a hacker breaks into the Pope's personal computer and issues a warning that a church there "kills to defend itself." The Church, "Our Lady of Tears" is slated for demolition, and two people involved in its potential closing have already been killed. Perez-Reverte provides long--I'd say overlong--descriptions both of his characters and of Seville, including, for example, list of the names of 27 bars in one section of the city. I read this book because it was on the list for my book-club. Maybe I'm just not enough of a mystery-lover, but it did nothing for me.
1	A Real Pearl: Perez-Reverte disappointed me in the nautical chart book. It was artsy--too many references to books and movies, as if his characters couldn't emerge out of their actions. That's not the case here. His priests are real. That's a lot tougher than creating real cops in this world. And so's his Vatican. Dibden's CABAL works the same vein, but the comparison is all in Perez-Reverte's favor. He's closer here to DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP than to CABAL. Cather gets the 5th star; that's the only reason THE SEVILLE COMMUNION doesn't.
0	Don't Bother: I had really grown to enjoy Perez-Reverte's books after first reading some of his other stories such as the Fencing Master, the Flander's Panel, and the Queen of the South. I thought I'd gotten a good bargain by purchasing this book at $.45, but sometimes it's better to hang on to loose change. In this book, the plot was weak from beginning to end, and the climax was unrealistic, even with a stretch of the imagination. I was completely disinterested in the characters whom for the most part were unlikeable, anyway. On several occasions I thought about putting the book down, and had I not been spending a week on the beach with not much else to do, I probably would have. This book gave me the impression that the author was simply trying to fulfill his contract with the publisher to write a certain number of books, regardless of quality, before a certain date.
0	Review fraud: The Institute for American Indian Studies did not review this book. The attributed review originated with the author.
0	TOO VAGUE: I found this book to lack depth and explanation. It vaguely lists certain herbs and plants that are of a healing nature, but the true content I was looking for was not here. I wanted more in-depth remedies for particular ailments, where this book applies certain remedies to a very hazy and small range of problems. I was also looking for a guide to ritualistic traditions rather than unmeasurable herbal concoctions.
0	NOT MADE FOR THE REAL MOBILE DJ: IT DOESENT HAVE A HOLE IN THE BACK FOR THE CABLES THATS THE DOWN SIDE THATS IT U HAVE TO MAKE A HOLE AND THE AMP DIDNOT FIT HAD TO CUSTOM FIT CUTS IN FOR THE SPEAKER CABLES
0	weakest of the series....: I have liked all of this series, but this one is the weakest- seems to be a lot of duplications of recipe types (ie 3 or 4 simillar fish recipes..). I still like the resturant overviews and layout tho. This one just seemed stale..(the Southern book is TERRIFIC.)
1	Mixture of old & new: "Haunted Heart" starts with a blast of recorded film music that my kids recognize from Bugs Bunny. Then, it goes into "Hello My Lovely", a Charlie Haden original. Charlie Haden does a similar thing on three songs. His Quartet West plays an instrumental version of the song, then it segues into a clip of a 40's-era vocal version. Jo Stafford sings at the end of "Haunted Heart", Jeri Southern at the end of "Ev'ry Time We Say Goodbye", and Billie Holiday at the end of "Deep Song". The Quartet West plays its jazz in a very mainstream fashion. Ernie Watts is a very lush saxophone player -- his generation's Ben Webster. Mix it all together, and it's all quite romantic, though in the melodramatic sense of the word. I'm not a big fan of attaching the old songs onto the end. It doesn't work out as creatively as it should be. Still, it's a good disc, and is about in the middle range of 4-star discs.
0	A Book with Some Gorey Details: Heart of a Jaguar book had an O.K. plot, and there were some good parts. However, the gorey parts made the whole book unenjoyable for me. Since many of them are not appropriate to discuss on the internet, I will not give examples - but they were disgusting. Occasionally the characters did inappropriate things, or used profane language. I know this was how people acted in Mayan days, but the discription of some things was a little bit much. So if you love reading about bloody and gorey things, you would enjoy this book.
0	YAYA: The Heart of a Jaguar was a pretty o.k. novel with inaproprite parts. It tells all out about the Mayan civilization.
1	Heart of a Jaguar Review: Heart of a Jaguar is a superb book for young adults. Though there is some blood and fighting explained in great detail, it is a tale of great interest. This book explains about a boy, Balam and his hardships. Balam, a descendent of the Maya, has trouble finding his place in his village. He is not a boy, but not yet a man. His village, along with many others is experiancing a great drought.Over all, Heart of a Jaguar is an extrodinary tale of a boy who is asked to make the biggest desion of his life. This novel is geared for young adults, and contains some mature material and violence.
0	locking cap?: seemed like a nice heavy steel cap and would have worked great if they would have sent the rite keys for it! keys have serial number on them and cap has serial number on it they did not match! next time i will go to a store and buy it to make sure they keys are the rite ones!!!
1	Western story: Westerns are my husband's favorites. He liked it very much, but I thought it was OK. We received it quickly and it was in very good shape.
0	A boring story in N.Orleans: The most boring story I ever read, The story of a crazy woman his sex maniac sister and the ape of her husband. All is surrounded by the tipical sexim of William's plays. Don't waste your money
0	BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!: I had to read this book for school. I do not recommend it to anyone. Boring, Boring, Boring, Boring. That sums it up. Blanche is out of her mind. Stanley is just mean and cold. Stella doesn't see the true colors of Stanley or Blanche. Boring, Boring, Boring, Boring
0	Beware: These chairs look good in the picture, but are very flimsy & cheap in person. We ordered 2 of them 3 weeks ago, and one is already falling apart. We would send them back, but we've already thrown out the boxes they came in. Save your money!
0	Safety questionable: I'm returning this car seat. After only using it twice, the belt clip pulled right out when I went to clip my child into the seat. I was disconcerted when it came out so easily and wondered how easily it might come out in an actual car accident. The manual tells you how to re-insert it, but the model I bought only has one slot for it, so there is no reason to make it easy to pull out (since it isn't adjustable with multiple slots for different sized kids). I'm not taking my chances on this seat...
1	decent for life: this product is good, haven't had any concern or problem with yet.latching it to the car is alright since my car is decent one/
1	Just fine: This is not a very pricey car seat but I think it's just fine. We have bought more expensive and presumeably safer cars seats, but with twins and the need to have 4 seats, I got this one because it was lightweight and could be used more for in and out of my husband's car and family members that might take the babies. God forbid we should ever be in an accident and have to really test them out, but they seem safe and sturdy enough for older babies.
1	Great toddler and boster: We got this soon after our first grew out of the regular toddler seat. I found this easy to use and buckle. We love it. It easily converted to a booster seat too.
1	Can't beat the price!: We bought 2 of these for Christmas gifts. I wouldn't have paid $40 for them but they were an excellent bargain at $10 each. I should have bought one for myself.
1	Tragic fall of a family: Bernice Rubens' novels are difficult to find here in America but are definitely worth reading.The Elected Member is about the Zweck family, a well-to-do Orthodox Jewish family in England, and how it slowly disintegrated because of their firm hold onto their culture. The novel centers on the eldest son Norman who once was a top lawyer, but had to be admitted to a mental instituion after suffering a nervous breakdown. But what causes his breakdown? Was it his parents who simply hold onto him too tightly? His 2 sisters whom he committed crimes of the heart against? Rubens expertly transport us to the Zwecks' family past and slowly reveals how past mistakes can come back to haunt everyone in a family.
1	PTCB Exam Review: I train pharmacy technicians, and this is the best, most concise review book I have seen. Almost everything on the test is covered here.
0	It made no sense: I should have looked before I checked out this book. there were no pics and some of the rhymes didn't. I was disappointed. I felt I wasted my monthly book.
1	Beautiful and inspiring: I love all Henri Nouwen's writing, but this is one of his greatest works. It breaks open the real meaning of Eucharist better than any other work I have read, for the ordinary lay person. The book itself is very high quality with beautiful illustrations. It makes a great gift (I have given away many copies). Put this by your bedside and you will find yourself going back to it again and again.
1	With Burning Hears Review: This is a great meditation on the Euchar5ist and its application to everyday life. I highly recommend it to believers (and others?)Ray Jorgensen
1	Best crochet book ever!: I taught myself how to crochet and this book answered the questions that I had. All the other books I have never explain certain things (like where to stick your hook in your chain row). It also contains alot of patturns I actually want to use rather than1 or 2 in other books.
0	Mediocre at best: Happy Hooker is neither a book about a hooker or how to crochet. This is less than mediocre - try Vogue Knitting on the Go: Crochet Basics (Vogue Knitting On The Go).
0	Errors and more errors: I was so excited to get this book. I wanted to make almost everything in this book because it was all so cute. However, I couldn't get the patterns to work. I looked up the "errata" page on the book's website, and it still didn't work. There are so many errors in this book that I can only successfully complete one pattern (for the granny square afghan). I loved the driving gloves, but the pattern is so incorrect, I never could finish them.I do not know if EVERY pattern has errors. The problem is that I don't trust the patterns to be correct, and I'm not experienced enough to figure out if they are correct just by looking at them. Perhaps if you are a true expert in crochet, you can figure out how to fix the pattern problems on your own. However, this book just sits on my shelf unused, because I'm not going to buy the yarn and spend hours working on a project I can't finish.
0	Please.....: Come on....the number of errors.I made the capelet twice, even though the ending stitch count wasn't what it should have been due to the pattern error. An intermediate crocheter would simply know to make increases (or decreases if appropriate) and move along. A beginner may just be frustrated when it doesn't turn out as it should.Then there was the beanie pattern that I basically "winged" and made from memorizing other beanies that I'd made before.The fashions are cute and inspiring but very basic and can probably be found for free on the internet.
0	Lives in denial: Having read most books on Krishnamurti, I would give this book only two stars. Lutyens decided not to disclose the extent of the personal relationship even though by her own admission she knew about it from Krishnamurti himself. To that extent Sloss is accurate. However, Sloss is living in complete denial by not acknowledging either the culpability of her father who was a court established embezzler of public funds, not to mention her mother who was a married woman at the time she began her relationship with Krishnamurti. There are some other allegations against Krishnamurti as well but the lack of any objective evidence indicates they are likely a projection of personal bitterness. Sloss has certainly not helped her credibility by waiting for several years after Krishnamurti's death to go public with her version of events that took place many decades earlier.
0	Warning will not play: WARNING....be careful of buying this unless you have a HD DVD. Too bad I bought this DVD as none of my players can view it and can not return it.
1	Fantasia Amazia: Fantasia always has a great product and once again they deliver. These pencils are superb and sturdy. Great for the half hazard artist whose product ends up all around them. These pencils crashed to the floor often and were not affected (Note: I do not recommend dropping ANY colored pencil)
0	not what you think: First off this helmet is enormous, even in a medium. It is the right size for my head and fits ok but I might as well flip it upside down because is sits on the top of my head and doesn't really go on or around it. There is so much padding inside it that it does not even slide halfway down your head. Obviously a knock off with the materials used. I don't understand why there are so many good reviews! The chrome looks nice but it's so easily corrupted that I scratched it with my fingernails trying to get the stickers off of it. I can understand that in order for it to be DOT approved that it should include a lot of padding but the only way this helmet would be safe is if you fell straight down from the sky onto your head. I am definitely returning this helmet despite having to pay for shipping both ways. I will up my rating review if the refund goes smoothly.
0	One Star for Amazon!: All the stars in the heavens for Mozart's Zauberflote, of course. But there seems to be a bizarre confusion on this product page and in the reviews that follow it. The two editorial review MUST refer to different books. Several of the reviews suggest that they concern a children's retelling of the Magic Flute story, in English with illustrations. Is this a full musical score with the libretto in German (without translation, as another reviewer complains) or a story book for children? Your guess is as good as mine, but I wouldn't buy it on guesswork.
1	Good Clean Show: My daughter requested these for Christmas. She watches them over and over. This is a good clean show for teenagers. Highly recommend.
1	"Fellini-esque" Tradtional Brass Band Gets Hip: Beautiful and irresistible brass band from Italy, fans of Tom Waits would love it, has a very similar feel to some of his work - nicely orchestrated, moody dirges.Track one features guest vocals by Dani "El Mono Loco" Carbonell, of Macaco and Ojos de Brujo. Other vocalists appear and they are great too. Mostly an instrumental album though.
1	Easy reading, informative, a good starting point for anyone.: This is a123 page book that's quick and very thought provoking. The message is very simple. Just meditate and listen to the God force that's universal in all of us. Here's a small quote from the book, "It's easier to help a person who knows nothing than a wise man who knows all. Betty is very common sense in this book. She's selling no magic you don't already own. Buy two and give one to a friend.
1	Carry Me Across The Mountain: Dan Tyminski's CD Carry Me Across The Mountain is cool and on the cover of the CD is Dan Tyminski playing the F - Style Nandolin.
1	I COULDN'T PUT THIS ONE DOWN!: This book is 500 pages long and I read it in 5 days. Putting the book down was impossible and I took it wherever I went. Even though the book is kind of a copy from LORD OF THE RINGS it still will get you hooked. I recommend this book for ages11 to adult. Interesting turns are always happening to the characters. If you can live through the semi-boring first 40-50 pages you will love this book.
1	My favorite book!: Don't listen to the people who are giving this1's and 2's. This is the best book i have ever read! If you like fantasy books you definately have to read this!
1	adam s31: I thought eragon was one of the best books i have ever read the best part had to be the end. I am deffintly reading Eldest and the rest of the series
0	"I love you, little one": Overuse, and improper use, of language - no starsBoring, one dimensional characters - no starsBoring one dimensional and repetitive plot devices - no starsAbsence of originality, but the weyrcat pretty cool anyway - one starBrom/Eragon relationship okay - one starEragon/Arya relationship (with yucky adolescent wet dreams) - MINUS one star.Getting me to read The Eye of the Wheel - 3 starsHaving my husband leave me annoying voice mail in a deep raspy voice saying "I love you little one" - 5 starsAnd that adds up to one star. No Paolini in my future.
1	ADVENTURE MAGIC AND ENCHANTMENT!: I loved it!!!!!!! I begged my Mom, I screamed, I threw a temper tantrum for her to read more every night because I wanted to know what was going to happen next! (just kidding- no temper tantrums- but I did beg) It's filled with cliff-hangers that make you need to know more.It's sad and somebody important dies. I have to confess that it has been done before, there were alot of things similar from other books. Like somebody important dies in Harry Potter too. But still, it is done in an original way. Christopher Paolini has his own unique attitude and stlye.I can't wait to see what will happen in the Eldest. There is a red dragon on the cover, not blue. And this book left me wanting to read more in the trilogy.
0	I think I've read this before.: Wow. I've never seen so much "borrowing" done. It's amazing!In my opinion, this should not be allowed to happen, but evidently I must be in the minority. Perhaps most people are not so well read as I and think that this book is in some way original. In my opinion, it is in no way original. There are borrowings from every major work of fantasy and most minor ones. It's really distracting as you attempt to read. This is one of the few books that I have started and could just not continue with. It was truely horrid. Wonderful beginners work, I guess and great for a seventeen year old, but why publish it?
0	horrible: One of the worst books I have ever read. Ever! I forced myself to read it only because it was a gift, but honestly it's not worth the paper it was printed on. I wish I had those hours of my life back, I totally regret reading it.The characters are flat and have only one demension. The names are either copied from better books, impossible to pronounce or complete cheese. Through out the whole book you feel bad for the characters because the dialog is so bad.I've read better work by14 year old class mates!
1	Good read, despite the elitest raving: I read this book in two days at work...I liked it very much, though I did find that it had many common elements of other fiction. What doesn't? Everyone should know, there is never anything that is original now! Everything is a copy and it can be easily argued...The people raving about how bad this book is are simply elitist. They have had favorites in the past and are acting like they are rouge scholars and this book isn't worth there VERY valuable time. They are full of it! I say...Congratulations kid; I look forward to reading on and finding out what happens to our young hero.
0	Cute story but its been done: While I applaud the kid's efforts and see a fine writing future for him, I must point out that this book is a regurgitation of every other major fantasy series to date. If it were not in fact his parent's publishing company I doubt he would have been published. The story itself is cute, but the writer is young and needs many more years of polishing before he can reach the standards of those authors he's parroting in this book. It's quite sad that there is nothing new in this book. I had hoped for better.
0	Bland.: The kind of repetetive, banal, Tolkien-referrenced nonsense that gives fantasy a bad name. Loved by pre-teens, juveniles, and neophytes to the genre. Not a bad introduction to fantasy if you are young, but definitely uninteresting to an adult reader.
0	Rip Off: This book was The Dragonriders, LOTR, and HArry Potter in one. Even the names arent original, the Hero of destiny: LOTR, Aragorn, Eragon, Eragon, the Elf mistresss, LOTR, Arwen, Eragon, Arya, the evil foot soldiers: LOTR: Uruks/Orcs, Eragon, Urguls: The Wizard: LOTR, Gandalf, Eragon,Brom, The evil speacalist: LOTR, Nazgul, Eragon, Rozack, LOTR: Mordor, Eragon: Morzan, the list goes on and on. The character development is the same, and the nations are exact: both have dwarves who have shut themselves from the world, and a love story between a man and an elf, shaky alliances between the evil foot soldiers and the evil empire. And the spells all resemble that of Harry Potter. This book is ok but if u want a real adventure story thats original read all of Tolkiens books.
0	If their was a -5 Star... I would choose it..: I definitley give 'Eragon' a -5* star. I would if it were an option.Some well known 'funnies' to eragon1. Aria and Eragon will probably turn out to be brother and sister.2. Eragon is mad at Murtagh for being not 'merciful' enough, and later in the book is happy that murtaggh is such a 'merciless' fighter.3. Guess what story this is: A boy and an older man go off for an adventure! Nope! YOUR WRONG! Its not star wars!4. Aragorn and Arwen, Eragon and Aria? Call me crazy.. but they sound familar...I'm sorry I wasted 3 hours reading this book
1	Five stars doesnt even do it enough justice.: FANTASTIC!! AMAZINGLY THRILLING!! Paolini deserves an A+! very original, action packed, and all out cool, this book is defenatly a best seller!! by the way,Saphira was so well developed, I pictured the perfect dragon in my mind. NO young author can out-write this master of the English language!
1	An Awesome Read!!!: Eragon is an awesome read for people of all ages, ecspecially those who enjoy fantasy. Eragon has managed to hold my attention better than many fantasy books including the Lord of the Rings series. It's a fantastic story about a boy that enters the ranks of the legendary "Dragon Riders". I don't want to give too much away so honestly if you have a chance read Eragon it's incredible. Just one warning start early in the evening, if you don't you'll find it's well past midnight before you manage to find a good place to leave off.
0	it's not worth reading: There are a lot of one and two star reviews about Eragon. They seem to fall into 3 categories:1. The fantasy fans who have read other fantasy books or watched fantasy movies and therefore know that Eragon is a rip-off and they are not happy about it.2. The people who know something about good writing and therefore know how badly written Eragon is and they are not happy about it.3. The people who think the book is boring and predictable and can't finish it.Personally, I didn't like it because the female characters in Eragon are a joke. Well, all the characters are, but especially the females.I think if you buy it you'll probably regret it. Take it out from the library and see what you think because it's quite possible you'll hate it.
0	ewww!: This was one of the worst books I have ever read. The plot was quite interesting, but the way it was wrtitten was horrible. It dragged on and on about unimportant topics and was extremely boring. The action started around the two hundreth page. I would definitly not recomend this book.
0	I don't care how young the author was at the time...: It's sad that so much of the hullabaloo over this book comes from the fact that the author was a teenager when he wrote it. That's all well and good and impressive, but that does not mean the book is super. I'm sorry, but when I read it, I did not think about how old the author was and take that into consideration.The fact is that this is a so-so fantasy that follows the lines of so many other so-so fantasies without doing anything the least bit original.The characters are flat, the pacing is horrid, and someone needed to rip the thesaurus from little Paolini's hands. No one needs that many adjectives per sentence!Painfully generic and nothing at all special.
1	Great audio theater!: I had already read the book and the Eldest book before purchasing this set. It is an excellent quality audio book. It amazes me that one man did so many different voices. He is an excellent actor. The dragon's voice sounded funny to me at first, but now I can't believe they will use a women for the voice in the movie. Dragons are big creatures with big voices.A few friends have listened to the CDs because they didn't want to read it all before the December15th movie is released. They loved it too and the Eldest CDs. Audio books done well can be a great way to experience a story. I have purchased other audio books that basically just read the book aloud. This was acting. Its worth the money. We have enjoyed listening to it at least 3 times since it was purchased.
0	"I WAS FORCED TO READ THIS BOOK AT GUNPOINT BY FAN-BOY TERRORISTS!": [...]When I was in grade school I could remember the corny holiday card making projects. Those with no originality, which were the majority of kids in school, sprinkled glitter and crappily and happily glued little bows on the card. Those few who rebelled and wanted to differ from the class herd, drew Santa on fire or added some far different materials on it. The point of the metaphor is,Yeah, you love/like Eragon, not so much because it is your genuine preference, but because you do not want to differ from the class herd. That and you probably lack a basic reading in significant literature. But hey, if this author can sell-out and sell his books out, more power to him. You have a right to your opinion. But that doesn't make this book read any less like hackneyed cardboard fantasy prose...it still does.
1	Eragon: Have you ever been in a place where Riders and Dragons Rule? The book I'm writing this review about is Eragon, by Christopher Paolini. The book takes place around the medevil ages in the1600's in early Europe. I would classify the genere of this book as fantasy and adventure because of the dragons and the long journeys. The story is about a young boy named Eragon, who finds a blue stone that's really a dragon egg. Eragon has to battle to save a kingdom with his dragon, Saphira against dark enemies. There is a sequal to Eragon called Eldest and there is currently a movie out based on this book. I like this book because it makes you think about what is happening because the writing is descriptive. I think Eragon is appropriate for middle school and high school students because of the difficult vocabulary. You should read Eragon because it challenges you to believe that what is happening to Eragon is real!
0	Childish and too unoriginal: The amazing thing about this book was that it was written by a15 year old. But the bad thing is that it was horrible. The charactors were so much like LOTR. I felt like this book was too slow paced and lacked action. It also had a very loose story line and lacked any epic feeling. I also felt that is was hard to love the charectors. They all(old or young) had the heart of a15 year old. Brom,the old wise rider, lacked the wiseness that charectors such as Gandalf had. Overall I hated this book and i dont intend on reading the rest of the series.
0	I've read it all before: I've been a bibliophile since I was about six years old, and this is the first and only book that I have ever thrown onto the floor in disgust. From the poor orphaned farm boy who gets swept up into an exciting adventure, to the completely predictable dragons, dwarves and elves, to the Star Wars-esque evil empire and resitance movement, to the appearance of the white bearded wizardly mentor (tm), it seems as if every single stale fantasy cliche gets trotted out and pressed into service. This is a book composed of stock characters and overused plot points in an entirely typical and unimaginative pseudo-medieval fantasy setting. Anyone looking for a good YA fantasy novel would probably be better off with something by Diana Wynne Jones, Garth Nix, Tamora Pierce, Phillip Pullman, J.K. Rowling, Holly Black, Monica Furlong, Susan Cooper, or any of the many other writers out there who have come up with vastly better books for younger fantasy fans.
1	Some southern girl,: Ok i gotta say Christopher's(chris) book Eragon may have given away future plots in the story but you always had to guess when they came.i mean don't you people think it's nice to know how things work?and yes you may be able to tell he was real young when wrote Eragon but for some fantasy books that i've read by 40 year old people Eragon had way way more action.and about the whole crying thing,if you acctually read the book you would understand that Eragon had alot of pain in his life and to top it all off it was all happing at the same time.First with people he loved dieing, and losing good friends for a while.come on people show some sympathy.so to conclude my review I give it a two thumbs up,Chris could have done a little better but that's what practice is for right?But if this goes against what you think DEAL WITH IT!
1	Almost Amazing: The story of Eragon has all the makings of being one of the best fantasy books I have ever read. It only falls a little short during the few passages and plot lines that seem forced and don't allow you to get completely sucked into the book. Overall its worth reading.
0	Obviously writen by a15 year old: This book may have a good plot line, but by chapter three I began dreading picking this book up to read each night. I picked this book up because I am an imense Harry Potter and Artemis Fowl fan. I was very disapointed.The subject (and typically the first word) of every sentance in this book is a proper noun. Trying to keep track of the he, she, they and its quickly became annoying. Also, the author can't mention any inatomate object without giving you several long metaphores or symolies to describe it.This book reads as though it was writin by someone who has never heard of any literay devices other than symolies and metaphores and believes writing a good story means cramming as many of them into it as humanly possible. Sometimes less is more.
1	Eragon Book Review: This book was wonderfully imaginative and captivating. It contains all the elements that a fantasy reader could want and more. The action, emotional features, and the bonds of friendship are so clearly shown that it is nearly impossible for a person not to get caught up in it all.Christopher Paolini brings out the hero in his brave, yet young, character, Eragon. Paolini shows us how destiny controls our lives and that we have to accept who we are, no matter how much we wish otherwise. In the end, we may have bigger plans made for us in our lives than we ever could have made for ourselves. Christopher Paolini, my thanks for the wonderful journey!
1	I Love this Book!: Wow! This was a great book. I anticipate the rest of the trilogy. I'm a fan of Pern and when Anne McCaffery had rave reviews of Eragon, I had to buy it. I have not been disappointed. I highly recommend this book and intend to have my 9 year old son read it starting this weekend! I am normally a very slow reader but I was finished with this tome in less than 4 days, something of a record for me! My congratulations to Mr. Paolini! I can hardly wait for more!
0	Hmmm: This is alright for a beginner but, I hope his next book improves greatly, otherwise I will not even bother to read the third one.One thing that bugs me about this book is that the author seemed to keep changing his mind about almost everything! For instance, his dragon. She keeps almost changing shape! She's supposed to be so huge and strong but can't carry three people. She flies way up in the air one day, but the next day she can't breathe that high. It makes no sense. Its as if the author keeps switching from one story to another.I don't think it was written well.
1	A knockoff--yeah, but I liked it!: Ok, so its obvious Paolini was a Tolkien fan, and his descriptions of elves and dwarves come right out of middle earth, but I couldn't help it, I liked his story. As it progressed, I found myself checking his map and seeing exactly where his characters where and where they were going and I was hooked. Although I could tell a teenager, albeit a talented one, wrote this book, I thought Paolini's writing and plot got more polished the more I got into it. I'll be reading the next one for sure, and I'm not even a kid, just a middle aged housewife. I am sure any young reader would love this story!
0	Cliched, derivative, passable: Eragon is a fantasy novel written by Christopher Paolini. He started when he was fifteen, and finished when he was nineteen, which is truly a noteworthy accomplishment. This book has been hailed as a phenomenon, and has become an international bestseller. But honestly, I wrack my brain trying to understand how and why. For those who have read and love Eragon, I hope you become exposed to real fantasy and science fiction soon. For those of you who haven't read this, let me make a suggestion: read Lord of the Rings, and watch the original Star Wars trilogy. You'll know all you need to know about Eragon, and you'll save your money.
0	Needs works: I picked up this book based on some of the hype generated around Paolini. While I have to agree with some of the other reviews regarding the writing style and the portions of the story which are influenced from some very geat Authors. Even though Paolini has taken plot lines from other Authors I will wait to see where these stories end up. I don't want to trash his first effort completely and look forward to seeing what the next volume has in store. Hopefully, the editing issues can be resolved by then.
0	Not too great: this book is a major acomplishment for a15-16 year old, but so much stuff is ripped off of LOTR. It's really predictable and you can see what will happen chapters early if you are13+ years old. what really bugs me is that Paolini describes EVERY SINGLE THING in the book. i mean, do we really NEED to know what all the unimportant characters look like with so much choppy detail??? also, sometimes the characters speak like it's Middle Earth, and sometimes they speak like it's Today.
1	great book @#$% the bad reviews: the inheritence series is a great series to read. i loved every word in it. Also read the next 3 books
0	A REAL STINKER: Eragon is a total joke. I'm like the only one I know who finished it. Most of my friends tossed theirs. Does any character do anything it makes sense on it? Stupid. Stupid. Stupid. Stupid. Stupid. Stupid.
0	Borderline Plagiaristic: Eragon is a fluffy version of Lord of the Rings or the Wheel of Time. It shouldn't have been published.I recommend reading The Golden Compass by Philip Pullman instead of Eragon. It is much deeper and much more original.
0	Had he been much older, I doubt this would have been published.: Sure, it's good for a17-year-old, but that doesn't make it good literature. I think I've seen fan fiction better than this.So many elements of the plot, locations, even names are almost shamelessly derived from other works of fantasy, such as 'The Lord of the Rings' and 'Star Wars'. I read this in 6th grade and, of course, loved it. Now I've gone back, re-read it, and it's almost painful, how so much of this over praised purple brick is clearly written by a kid. It's good for a17-year-old, sure, but to me, that doesn't save it from being mediocre.Nonetheless, if he keeps this up, Paolini shows great promise at an older age. But for now, I'd much rather read Philip Pullman's 'His Dark Materials', or anything by Tolkein,instead this overrated purple brick of a fantasy novel. Kids will probably love it, but anyone older will probably be able to see through it.
0	I Could Write A Better Book: The only thing that grabs any attention to the "Inheritance" series is that Paolini is only17. If the exact same book was written by a 40-year-old, the book would have sold about 50 copies. The book is completely a ripoff of good sci-fi stories and the plot makes no sense. No sense whatsoever. Do us all a favor and buy a Get Fuzzy comic book. PEACE OUT!LOCAL CRAZY MONKEY
1	Best fantasy book ever: Despite what other people have said about this book, it is most likely the best fantasy book that I have EVER read! The people that complained about his language and choice of words obviously didn't read the book that I read. His vocabulary in this book was OUTSTANDING! I can't believe that he is only19! And, just because he knows to use other words besides 'said' doesn't make the book tacky!!!!! I think that its awesome that he uses rich vocab. Many books written by accomplished authors don't even write as well as this man did!!! I can't believe that people could criticize a book and dislike it just because he has wonderful vocabulary in this book. The people whom criticized it probably are just upset and jealous because they didn't know what the words meant and don't have that good of a vocabulary. This book is awesome with a deep plot, developed characters, and tense battles. Read it!!!!!!!!!!!
1	Fun read.: This book was a fun read. There are times that you can tell that the writer was in his mid to late teens when he wrote it, and other times that he writes far beyond what you would expect from someone his age. Excellent read that I would recommend to any fan of this genre.
1	Very Entertaining: I enjoyed this book quite a bit. While it is a bit derivative, the way it was written is entertaining and there are enough original components to keep you interested.
0	Boring and bad writing: All I can say is that i couldnt get through it. Poorly written and rather boring. I love a good fantasy book and there are many good ones out there that others have listed. Don't bother with this one
0	Save Your $ For Something Worth While: Like so many others I wasn't going to comment on either of these books but some of the recent reviews pleading with people to read it makes me sick. Begging people to read this? DO read the reviews however AND DO read them with a grain of salt the good obviously are there to promot the book,but many of the not so good reviews are there to promote it too. Don't fall for this and waste money lining this author's pockets. I rate this as NEGATIVE -5 star! Don't buy this book! You are better off without it.
0	don't leave me hanging: I just could not get this book. I was so confused with this made up language and the the main character drove me nuts! Is he this great dragon rider who can use magic, or is he a pouty teenager from the 21st century.When I got to the end I was so upset because I felt that there was so much that has been left unanswered. I felt that I was left hanging with some important issues, such as Eragons parents. It seemed to me that at the begining of the book he cared a great deal with wanting to know about his parents, especially his dad. But when it was discussed later on in the book Eragon never tried to find out any information. Especially when the character Brom talked about his mother and the fact that he knew her. Which led me to come up with my own speculation of...was Brom his father? Who knows because nothing was revealed.
1	Copy-cat: Overall I thought Eragon was a pretty good book. I liked the way Paolini described the land, people, and dragons. Although, he needs to learn to be more original. I can see getting your inspiration from a book (The Lord of the Rings) but this is just taking it too far. Paolini is obviously talented so he should use his talent and creat something of his own!Eragon needs to stop being so inquisitive. Some of his questions that are needed to describe things could be answered through the story instead of by the characters. The story has an okay plot line and I am eager to see where it takes Eragon. But advice for Paolini on future books, use your imagination and do something original! It's easy to imitate other books but it takes talent to come up with something new.
1	Exquisite and Riveting: When I had first heard of the book, I thought it would be a ridiculously confusing science fiction fantasy book that was not worth the trouble of reading. However, I gave in and checked it out form the library after my curiousity rose when I saw its unpublished sequel being sold on amazon. I am very glad I did. Eragon staisfied my appetite for a good, decent, and understandable story about dragons, and Eragon and Saphira. I enjoyed the plot development and the creativity Paolini put into making the story and its world seem real and fascinating. I wait patiently and curiously for the second book of the trilogy, Eldest, which I hope will be as good or exceed Eragon. Loved it and recommend it to all fantasy-genre lovers. Enjoy!
0	boring and, well, boring.: I believe that my title says it all but I will add a little more. If you have read this book you might have noticed that the main charactor, Eragon, is knocked out during all but one battle scene. From this I conclude that the author is a wimp and is too frightened to write out the details of a battle. Don't read this book and read the Tolkien books instead.
0	Not even close to the hype: Poorly written cross of Pern, Middle Earth, and all the rest. You'll find yourself stumbling over tedious descriptions and unneccessary dialog tags trying to read a story that you feel you're read before... This is, quite frankly, the kind of writing you find in online fan fiction.
1	Eragon: I got an ARC of the upcoming Random House release of Eragon at the BEA in Los Angeles; read the book on the way home. Out of curiosity I got a copy of the self-pubbed book to read and compare. I loved both! I wish the best of success to the young man.The Random House reps are spreading this review of Eragon to the trade: "Full praise to Eragon and I want more! A winner ... tip of the hat to young master Paolini."--Anne McCaffrey
0	Don't let the rave reviews fool you!: Like many, our family bought this book and the next based on the glowing reviews of the many readers. Unfortunately, we were in for quite a shock as these are the most unimaginative, poorly written books ever published. At Borders where I returned all four books we purchased (2 copies of Eragon and 2 of Eldest), there was a pile of returned copies of Eldest behind the counter. I was in fact unable to get a refund, instead I got store credit on a gift card.Eragon is an uninspiring story chock full of tired, overused characters. The prose is unimaginative, very wordy, and fails miserably on all levels. Each characters talks just like every other character. I don't know why everyone said this book was so good. My kids are in tears. Thanks a lot Chris Paolini for ruining our last week of summer break!
0	Two things: Eragon has two things going for it:1) The cover. Come on, ya gotta admit that it's pretty, right?2) The plural of "Galbatorix" is "Galbatorices".
1	A Kid's Review - Awesome Book!: I'm 9 years old and I really don't like to read very much but my mom suggested i should read this book. I started reading it and loved it. Eragon is an awesome book and i think everyone who likes action-packed fantasy books should read it. its about a teenage boy who finds a dragon egg and raises it to be a powerful beast. Together they go on a journey to fight the evil king Galbatorixs.This book is 497 pages of fun. I can't wait to read the next one!
0	Yuck!: Shallow characters, uninteresting story, and an unoriginal fantasy land fail to sate my sense of wonder. It's like so many previous reviewers said, its all been done before and Chris has just stapled all these mediocre fantasy staples into one humdrum conglomerate of nothingness. Kind of what Stephen King did in the Dark Tower (Adams,Baum) only at least King can write!!!!!!!!!Anyway don't bother with this steaming pile of sentence fragments and embellished adverbs. If you want a GOOD young adults fantasy saga check out Philip Athans "His Dark Materials", contrary to this you WONT be disappointed
0	You Can Run But You Can't Hide: This book is a rip off the famous Star Wars Saga. I cant stand it. It also borrows a few ideas from the Dragon Riders of Pern and Lord of the Rings. It may have been an enjoyable read but still pathetic.
1	excellent effort: Having written fiction since I was 7 (that's 80 years ago), I am impressed by what this young man has achieved. It's not great literature, nor even particularly original, but it's an excellent start. I couldn't have done as well at his age; and I'm a dam' good writer.
0	not great, but not terrible: Ok it was pretty derivative, although I admit I never clued in on the Star Wars similarities until I read some reviews. And the writing was pretty pedestrian. But I did enjoy it and that has to count for something. A good introduction to the genre for young readers? yeah I think so.
1	An entertaining read: Is it the same world that others made up? Yes, that's true. There's little originality in Eragon's universe.Is the prose below the level of Tolkien? Obviously. It is on par with Robert Jordan, which I think is decent enough, as Eragon is merely another fantasy novel and not an epic work.Is the plot completely and utterly predictable? It is so predictable that the complete plotline of the entire trilogy is spelled out in a fortune-telling early on.But is it entertaining? Yes!If you can settle for the penultimate.. if you can enjoy a book for its vividness and adventure, even if it wasn't written by an Oxford scholar... then you will love Eragon. It is not /Lord of the Rings/-- it is /Harry Potter/.
1	Eragon is amazing: Eragon was looking for a deer to eat for his family. He tried to get the deer but he found an egg instead. He did not know what was inside of it. One day the egg hatched and a baby dragon came out. Then the dragon flew in the sky and turned into a big dragon. But then Eragon had to fight the darkness and kill the person who makes fire. Read this book to find out if the firemaster dies. This book is for eight-year-olds and up.
0	Time for Credibility/Reality check??: The reason people claim to love this book is because it was supposedly written by a kid. Definitely time for some truth in martketing Knopf. Paolini is at this time 22 years old. If I do the math and go back 2 years that makes him19 or 20 when Eragon was published. A19 year old is not a kid. So why market this book as written by a kid? Only reason I can figure is since the book could not be sold otherwise. As for litery quality or merit this book has none. I didn't dislike it due to the fact it was derivative. I disliked it because it was contrived, poorly written, and lacking any redeeming quality. Parents before letting your kids read this think twice about the poor example being set.
0	verbose!: This book is full of adverbs and adjectives and extremely verbose. Sounds amateurish. Lost my interest. Stick to established fantasy writers to get your money's worth from your reading.
1	WOW!: A wonderful book full of fantasy and wonder. When you think you have the plot figured out it changes and changes again. Better than Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter in my opinion!
0	Geez.............: As other reviewers have alredy stated, Eragon Does draw too much from other much better works of fantasy. What I noticed the most though, was how much was taken from David Edding's "Belgariad". The stories are so alike. Eragon is a farm boy, just like Garion. Eragon is an orphan, just like Garion. Eragon befriends a storyteller who turns out to be a sorcerer, Just like garion. Eragon does magic in the same way Garion does, through "The will and the word".I could go on and on. I think Paolini counted on the fact that most people haven't read Edding's masterpiece. One of the only resons his book sold so well was because he was so young when he started writing it.Also, the dialogue is stupid, and it is obvious that he tries to make his writing sound impressive through flowery writing style.
0	I really wanted to like this book: Really, I wanted to like it. That's why I kept reading. But ultimately, an editor needed to sit him down and tell him to take it down a notch. Or two. It was soooo overwritten and totally unoriginal. I got the feeling that Paolini is used to everyone defering to his superior intellect and that nobody around him had the sense or the heart to tell him his book was crap. It took me days to plod through it.
1	Good, but written by a teenager: This book was pretty good. It took a while to fully get into the story and I did not think the plot or action moved along enough, but am interested to see what happend to the cahracters in book 2. You can tell it was written by a teenager as some of the vocabulary, plot development, and character assessment were rather rudimentary. I did like how there were some new types of chracters introduced into the fantasy world, such as the werecat, But overall, it was worth the read.
0	Even for a seventeen-year-old....: This is among the worst fantasy books I have ever read, and it infuriates me that it is getting so much attention. I could possibly forgive the utter lack of ingenuity of its plot or the language, which is more suited for a 7-year-old, if only I saw some signs of the author caring about the quality of his book. Unfortunately, it is obvious for the entire first third of the book that it was not even edited for basic grammar, and I find it insulting.
0	wow...what a disgrace: oh my god. this novel makes me want to eat six lemons and call my mom to tell her i hate cats. this is not in any ways original. what is happening to childrens fiction these days.
0	Meh ...: This book redefines derriviative. It seems like the sort of fan fiction where the writer goes in to other writers' worlds, kills their dragons, steals their gold, and makes out with their Arwen. This book makes a fine door-stop or paperweight, though (+1 star).
0	Not impressed: The author makes many radical and unrealistic assumptions based on the Bible with not one reference or footnote, and no bibliography.
1	Learn the lessons in the Bible: To be able to go through the entire Bible, verse by verse, chapter by chapter, book by book with such an amazing Bible teacher is such a blessing. Pastor Chuck clearly teaches topical lessons we can learn in the Bible, which were put there for us by God!
0	The book was great, this movie not so much: Nowhere near as good as the book. Nothing like it. You might like the TV personalities though. Still love Deepak though. Smart man.
1	Light, funny British Christmas fun: My kids and I really enjoy Creature Comforts. It is laid-back dry British Humor, the characters and voices together make the creatures endearing. Clean humor. It has no plot to speak of and no action. So if those are important to you, you might not like it.
1	Positively hilarious: This has become one of my favorite annual Christmas viewings and the funniest of my very large library of Christmas specials. So original and creative, and so very hilarious. Good pickup for just about anybody.
1	Creature Comforts Christmas: I really love this short movie, and I'm glad I could actually FIND it and for a great price. So, thanks a bunch!
1	interesting: I found the book interesting enough to stay reading it. I was never bored with it. I am always looking for a good western!
1	ANOTHER GREAT ADDITION TO THE COLLECTION !!!!!!: Not as magical and is darker than the first 3 movies. Overall it was a great movie!!!The ending leaves you anxious to see the next film!!!
1	Harry Potter Movies are Outstanding!: The Harry Potter movies are great! My favorite is the Goblet of Fire. It has a lot of action in it other than the to be expected. It was closer to the book than I expected.
1	great prices: I was very happy with this item! it was shipped quickly and it was still in the factory packaging just as promised. and the price was perfect! i watched it the day i got it.
1	Harry Potter Rides Again: Another fine adaptation (though you get the sense that they could have added in more). The students are growing up, the stakes are getting higher, and this, of course, features the full return of Voldemort. And of course there's the character played by an actor doomed to play that infernal pasty white sparkly vampire in the years to come. Where's a Voldemort or Wormtail in those Twilight films when you really need a sparkly vampire dispatched anyway?
0	Guilty: Drek in the First Degree: All of the Harry Potter movies (as well as the books) are artless adolescent, "no-rules" fantasy composed of pubescent cultural drek of interest only to those newly familiarizing themselves with incipient secretions of estrogen and testosterone. Mature adults, stay away unless you consider gagging and retching forms of entertainment.The most recent (...Goblet of Fire) is actually the worst - mostly for the length of time (2.5 hrs.) it takes to pass. Rawlings is no Tolkien, and director Newell provided no improvements. The special effects - especially flying - are too fast and furious to be appreciated as anything but blurs. If you must see this travesty, complete the experience with stale popcorn.
0	Is this a bootleg copy?: I ordered this to replace a missing copy for our home collection. The HP movies are our favorites, and we watch them often. I loaned Goblet to someone, can't remember who, and it's been more than a year. I finally decided to admit it's not coming home, and ordering a new one. Unfortunatly, you get what you pay for here. I was excited to find a coopy for around five dollars (and didn't think twice about it, since Blue Ray is becoming popular, and it's an older movie now) but when we watched it last week, the DVD plays, but skips and catches every10 minutes or so and the picture looks 'off'. I haven't bothered trying to replace it, since it was only a few dollars, but I will be looking for a real copy soon.
0	Bait and Switch: Warner Bros. has shown us the dark side of the entertainment business by releasing this "Ultimate Edition" without the extended version. It's unfortunate they will still make money on these flawed editions from people who were pleased with the year one and year two sets(as was I), which included both the theatrical and extended films, who will feel compelled to keep this incomplete set (I will be returning mine). I encourage everyone who feels the same to write about it. Whether it's in these reviews, a blog or emails directly to Warner Bros., letting the powers that be know that their customers are dissatisfied is the only way they'll even consider terminating these shady business practices. The following link is to Warner Bros. Studios' online customer service: [...]
1	Very Entertaining: I'm not certain that this edition is better than the dar kand disturbing Prisoner Of Azkaban, although it is solid entertainment in a sort of "potentially fatal" Olympics kind of way. The acting is improving with the maturity of the cast and The Goblet of Fire really brings this into the light. A must see film for fans of the series although perhaps not the best of the series.Fans of this Harry Potter type of fantasy also check out- Artemis Fowl or The Uncommon Adventures of Tucker O'Doyle
0	Italian language available ?: Someone could tell about italian language on ultimate edition ?Thanks for helpHarry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Ultimate Edition) [Blu-ray]
0	Not extended!: There is an extended version and this is not it. It is on television all the time. Clever of the WB to make the first two extended and not the next two. I assumed they were extended and bought them.
0	What a dirty trick: Ran into Bestbuy today grabbed the first DVD of Potter I saw. Got home, it was one disc no special features. Why not just make one edition like with all the other Potter movies? What a dirty rotten trick pulled by Warner Brothers. (...)
0	Betrayed: If you are a fan of the book do not watch this movie. They have turned what may be the best book of the series into an amusement park ride - all flash and no substance. As the books evolve J K Rowling has targeted an older and more mature audience. This movie targets the mindless.
0	why a director is able to ruin an adventure of a lifetime: harry potter movies1 and 2 and 3 are excelent.they cut, obviously, but the story was still a clear, presise message. then along comes a yodelin', rough backin' coyote to change everything the way he sees fit. heres just some of the loose ends left untied.why did neville go nuts by the cruciatus?how did crouch live, escape, attack moody,who killed crouch? where did the house elves go, when is fudge gonna call dumbledore mad? what about rita skeeter? or spew? and theres hardly any snape!at least the actors were good. daniel radcliffe, EMMA WATSON ,and rupert. but the director must think that because they call it harry potter, it cant be about any one else. i quote: 'harry potter and the goblet of fire is about HARRY POTTER, and THE GOBLET OF FIRE. PERIOD!'
0	Good job, geniuses.: Okay, everyone who's given this movie a good review and critiqued the rest of us for comparing it to the movie, is not too bright.What you fail to realize, is that the movie doesn't form a coherent plot, unless you've read the fourth book. So, the book fails on two fronts. As a movie, it isn't coherent enough to be considered good. Too much time is spent on things that aren't crucial, while crucial events are extremely undercovered (see Chapters1-12).As a movie replicating a book, it miserably fails. All can agree.1 Star. Next time, pick a side, and stick to it.
0	Enough Chumps Will Buy It Anyway: Goblet of Fire, the movie, is an unacceptable hash. Sure, the original is a long book. Did the mercenaries running this franchise think perhaps to make it into two movies and sell them both? I understand that a film adaptation of a novel is an adaptation, not a copy in another medium, but it must still be a finished work in its own right. GOFtm is so disjoint and illogical and the progress through it so unmotivated that a fair amount of what happens in it makes no sense. It would be a complete waste of money even if the book did not exist. This is not a film but an insult. Slapdash, haphazard, chopped up exploitation. The cinematic equivalent of a Barbie doll.
1	Very cool book!: Beautiful book. Cover and art are incredible. Very proud to display in home. This is a great, quick read and this edition is very nice.
1	Greatest author: This novel is one of the best ever written by the greatest author ever. I first read this book when I was in third grade, and still love it five years later. This story was the first to get me into the fantasy genre and it has truly been a marvelous journey ever since. To anyone who enjoys a good story, read this tale of elves, dwarves, dragons, trolls, hobbits, and wizards. Also, if you choose to read this novel, don't forget to read the even better Lord of the Rings Trilogy by the same author. Remember to read this first, however. Don't listen to the other reviews which state that this book is a load of hogwash. It is, in fact, a wonderful adventure that a reader will never forget.
0	cheesy/boring: sometimes when i was reading this i just feel like why am i reding this?? people told me that its a goodbut technically it makes no sense at all. its not tht great honestly.
1	There and back again, a Hobbit's tale, by Bilbo Baggins: This is the story of Bilbo Baggins, a Hobbit, of Bag End, Under Hill, Hobbiton. The story tells of how Bilbo came to be involved in the dwarves mission to travel to The Lonely Mountain, defeat Smaug (the dragon) and retrieve their treasures and their homeland. It's a great tale of survival through untold hardships, when all seems to have failed, and yet, a little luck, and a little perseverance sees them through.The Hobbit is a great introduction into Tolkein's world and a great set up for the Lord Of The Rings. I highly recommend it.
1	nicely done: this audiobook is a good. i was looking for a good audiobook where where i can relax and listen to. well, i found it. a very good renbition of the hobbit. buy it
0	What a HORRIBLE book.: I just don't see how everyone loves this book. It is a *never ending* tale of Bilbo Baggins and his 'journey' with the wizard and dwarves. J.R.R. Tolkien is a quite horrible writer...the story goes on and on and on, continuing with them hiding in a cave, fighting a dragon, or another thing of that sort. I am a pre-teenager and I still cannot focus on it because of its pure stupidity.
0	Well this book wins the award for the most boring, stupid &: This book had way to many characters! Is boring from start to end and has no point! What the hell does this book mean?
1	Deluxe Pocket Edition: I own many copies of the Hobbit to include the audio and ebook. This is a perfect travel version and read it often. Font size is perfect for me and the maps in the cover are great for quick reference. I have noticed a large number of one star reviews for this product that have nothing to do with it with most being either the Kindle version or the audiobook. Take heed when you look at the reviews.
1	All time favorite: This is a classic that can be read over and over. Good for reading aloud to the kids on trips too.
1	I loved it again!: I have several ragged copies of this here and there in and out of boxes. I don't have to hunt any more. It'll always be on my Kindle.
0	The hobit: The book is about a young hobit that goes on an adventurer to get rid of a ring that if you w where it you turn e ebook
0	How do you keep an idiot busy for hours?: If you have some extra time on your and feel like pissing it away, then read this book. I love literature;however, I cannot believe I wasted valuable hours of my life on reading this so called book. I've read technical manuals that are more interesting. If there is someone you really don't like, suggest that they read this book.
0	the stupidest book i have ever read!: i thought this book was the dumbest book i have read in a long time. i hated it. i found it very hard to get into with all the characters listed in it. i would give it0 stars if i could.
1	Amazing:): I have read this book several times and it seems to get better each time! I love this story! Very different tone than the Lord of the Rings, after learning more about JRR Tolkien it makes total sense. The Hobbit was written to a younger audience who would be adults by the time Lord of the Rings was published. Amazing, talk about attention to detail.Read this book if you haven't yet, it is simply fantastic. There is beautiful imagery, sword fights, dragons and trolls, what's not to love.
1	AMAZING: This is the best book ever, as it explains many things and story's in the Lord of the rings book.
1	Classic: There's nothing bad to say about this book! Everyone should read it before they die. Great, entertaining book for anyone.
0	Don't buy the audiobook: Please note that this review is specifically about the non-BBC audiobook version.I adore "The Hobbit." My first memory of my father is hearing him read the first page of the book to me as a very young child, and I've read the book countless times since then. Given my long commute currently, I've become a big fan of audiobooks. I picked this up with high hopes.What a let down. The audiobook is abridged, although the package didn't note that anywhere, the abridgement choices are odd at best (leave in Beorn but take out almost everything of Rivendell?), the voice actors seem to be interested in portraying the characters as comically and unpleasantly as possible (I want to give all of the elves in the audiobook some throat lozenges) and to top it all off, the sound quality is incredibly poor and inconsistent....
1	Hobbit: I really liked this book. The beginning was kind of slow, but if you keep on reading you can't put it down. I really like how he used the main character as a hobbit (or really small person), instead of this tall, masculine person, who works on a farm, and all the chicks dig him, because people like that have "a really hard time proving themselves".That why I like The Hobbit, because Bilbo proved himself even though he's three foot tall.It shows us that height and weight have nothing to do with our character. We could be four foot five and two hundred pounds outside, but a seven foot high one hundred forty pound body builder inside.
1	I read it again after 30 years - still good read: Almost as good as The Lord of the Rings trilogy, but more of a kid's story.Very enjoyable even so
0	good only for insomnia: Actually, I would prefer to give it zero stars. In a number of attempts to read this thing, I succeeded in falling asleep every time. In ten or so attempts I was able to get no further than page15. So dull.
0	The hobbit: Disappointed didnt receive the item at all and the transaction said it was successful even got an email confirmation saying my order was successful
0	LOTR is better: i didn't like this book very much. it seemed more like a children's book compared to lotr. Just an opinion
1	Good: Quick and e as y read. Pictures are to large had to continually turn book to see them. Good digital copy.
1	Slow but good story: This book takes a while to get into but I guess that is to be expected with an older novel and with Tolkien's writing style. However a good story overall and worth reading.
1	The hobbit: I am not much of a reader but I must say I really liked it had little dragged out spots very adventures
0	Am I missing something?: I read "The Lord of the Rings" trilogy before the movies came out in anticipation of them, having always put them off for one reason or another. Naturally I was drawn to this book afterwards as a way of looking for some of the background to the story. Honestly, I don't know what it is and hate myself for saying this, but I simply did not like this book. I'm not sure if it's the style of the narration or what it is, but I found it a struggle to read. I normally read until the end of a chapter and then stop for the time being, but with The Hobbit I found I could barely get through one chapter in a sitting. I know that many are going to hammer me as "not helpful" for knocking the book, but I just want readers to understand that this book, much like LOTR, is not for everyone. The LOTR is a much better read than this one, and in my opinion The Hobbit is really only a necessary read for those diehard fans who really need to know where it all began.
0	Little people versus a huge dragon: The little people win, of course, but boy does it take awhile for THAT to happen.
1	Great book to a Great Series...: First off I gave this book a four because, in my opinion, it was not as good as Lord of the Rings which I proudly would rate a five. Writers mature, getting better in their writing style on their second/third book. Tolkien did a fabulous job on the Hobbit. Humor, confilct, but no romance. Good for children, good for just anyone. I thought Bilbo to be hilarous, the dwarfs just as funny. A true classic was the Hobbit that it will remain on my "read again" books forever, until I die of course. If you haven't read it yet I highly recommed for anyone who is looking for a good book to try this one out. I know others have said it, and I won't be the last but Tolkien was a master writer of our time!!
1	Some people...: Do you find it interesting that all the people giving this excellent book a rating of one have dozens of spelling and grammar errors in their reviews? I think that is just about the least shocking thing I have ever seen. And can anyone tell me where the schools that "make" students read Tolkien are? At my school we have to read crap like "The Scarlet Letter". I am jealous of you people who were "forced" to read this book! In the sixth grade my teacher suggested that I read "The Hobbit" and L.O.T.R. Since then I have been a Fantasy MANIAC! I followed it up with Terry Brooks and Death Gate and I haven't stopped yet. I owe it all to The Hobbit! How could anyone not like this book?
1	Good Book but no music on Kindle Touch: The book is fantantic, with lots of information and figures.The only issue resides on the missing habilitie of the kindle touch to reproduce the authors voice on poems and music inside the book, this can only be done in Fire version or Kindle for Iphone or Ipad, not even on Kindle for PC. I really can't understand!
0	Poor edition for Amazon's own Kindle Fire HD: I do wish I could review the book separately from the edition. But you cannot so let it be known this is about the edition. For whatever reason Amazon has decided to provide this book in its' most complete form only on the iphone/ipad. The book on the iOS platform has the audio available within it. However, on Amazon's very own Kindle Fire HD that feature is not available. Kudo's to Amazon for telling you that up front but I find it really sad that Amazon does not fully support its' own platform.
1	awesome little book: This is the second time I've read the Hobbit but the first time I have owned it. It is an absolutely beautiful copy....gilded pages, leather cover with embossing, and a handful of illustrations. Definitely worth purchasing!
1	This book is absolutely the best!: I read this book10 years ago, and it has never left me since! Bilbo is an inspiration to us all! You can see yourself in his character. I have been suggesting this book to all of my friends since I read it, and each one who's read it thanked me immensly for introducing them to the world of Tolkien. Now I'm tackling the "Lord of the Rings Trilogy"....
1	Gorgeous Book: I had recently saw the movie and was intrigued to find out how the story ends so I bought the book. I'm not a big reader and have never liked paperback size 4 font books and this was def an excellent choice for me. Its an easy read and the bigger spaced out font just makes it more enjoyable to read for an extended amount of time. Its absolutely gorgeous and will look great on the bookshelf when I'm finished.
1	Wonderful!!!: I have read J.R.R. Tolkien's The Hobbit, and I think that it is a great book!! I recommend it to everybody!! It is my favorite book.
1	A Fine Beginning: While Tolkien was nowhere near as excellent of a writer at this point as he would become years later with the Lord of the Rings, the Hobbit is still an enjoyable introduction to Middle Earth. The story is more simple and the flow is more like reading a fable or children's story to me compared with the more serious and high fantasy style of the Lord of the Rings. The Hobbit is more fast paced. There is more action happening all the time but it's not as atmospheric. This is the story of Bilbo joining a band of dwarves to go get treasure from a dragon named Smaug. Along the way he braves many dangers such as orcs, trolls, giant spiders and meets Gollum and finds a ring. It's a good prelude but nothing amazing. However, the book does hold a special place for me because I found a copy in my parents book collection in the basement when I was a kid and it became the first book I ever read. I owe Tolkien a thank you for hooking me on books.
1	Awesome!!!: This is a great tale I loved every second of it! It is by far one of the best stories I have had the pleasure of reading!
1	lived up to the expectations: was a great book. Unlike LOTR which i tried to read once, I found this book to be very easy to read, and it went rather quickly.
1	great but not outstanding: I enjoyed Anderson's book, especially the background into Tolkien's sources and early writings that is invaluable. I must say I have read the Hobbit at least100 times and yet I have never enjoyed reading it as much as when I read it with Anderson's anotations. I especially appreciated the philological background into the many proper names and archaic words that Tolkien used. What is a "carrock"or what does "confusticate and bebother" mean? Now I know!I also enjoyed the immense number of illustrations that were included, many of them sketches and pictures made by J.R.R himself. Alas, they are not in color, most are black and white prints of original color pictures. If more had been invested in the visual quality of this book, it would have greatly added to the level of pleasure in the words of Tolkien that Anderson's comments bring out. Still worth the money, hopefully Anderson will add color in the next edition
1	Always enjoyable.: Like visiting with old friends and enjoying a lovely chat. I've read this multiple times and always find the adventure great.
1	The Hobbit is exceptional: The story is adventure and adventure. Exciting and thrilling, it left me breathless. The characters were so real and compelling.
0	Somewhat Overrated: The Hobbit is considered a literary classic for the fantasy standards it created, and though there's a wonderful story here (the Riddles in the Dark chapter with Gollum is particularly exciting), but I was turned off by the quick writing style that emphasizes innane background details and cordially dances past what could have been epic sequences. For example, we get a full paragraph or two describing Bilbo's Hobbit hole, yet a measly sentence or so describing a battle in a thunderstorm between giant rock monsters. The Hobbit is an imporant piece, and many will undoubtedly love it, but I found it difficult to enjoy.
1	Great for kids learning about J.R.R Tolkien: My 7 yr old son became interested in the Hobbit after a Lego catelog showed up with Lord of the Rings and Hobbit themed lego sets. He tried to read my copies of the LOTR and the Hobbit, but it was a little to much for him. I was excited to find a graphic novel version of the Hobbit. The pictures are engaging and keep to the spirit of the story. I know it misses some details that you will only get from reading the originals, if he loves the story as much as I do then he will eventually read the full length novels when he is older.
1	Amazing book!!! <3: Best book I've ever read!! Love it. Recommend lord of the rings as well. J. R. R. Tolkien really is an amazing author!
1	"The Lord of the Rings" Light: This is LOTR light; Well written, but not nearly to the fullest extent of the literary powers Tolkein reached later with LOTR. The story too, is more for younger folks. It should however be read before LOTR because it provides necessary background. It's a quick read too -1 day.
1	hobbit: When I read the hobbit , I could hardly put my kindle down! It`s magic and quite a few strokes of brilence from our favorite burglar Bibblo Baggins!
1	Adventure, Thrill, Treasure .... A delightful tale of fantasy.: The Hobbit is different from Lord of the Rings. Firstly its short but equally interesting. The Hobbit takes you to the wonderful world of Mr. Bilbo Baggins ( the hobbit) and how he is swayed away to the world of Adventure. It has everything a fantasy book should have - Trolls, Goblins, Elves, Wizard and of course the magic ring.I loved the book because it keeps you hooked from the first page and keeps the excitement right till the end. It's descriptive and a light read .All throughout history , we human beings have been fascinated of being Invisible - Invisible Man, Hollow Man, LOTR and of Course The Hobbit. The beauty of the book lies in the presentation and the creativity of J R R Tolkien.Enjoyable 320 page read with a good adventure and strong story.
1	Classic: I fell in love with the cartoon version of this movie as a child. Now, as a teenager I can appreciate the book all the more, and I thoroughly enjoy every moment of Bilbo's adventure. 5 big ol' stars!
1	Pretty Good Book: The Hobbit was grappling! It made me feel like I was the main charecter. The book is about Bilbo Baggins, a Hobbit Who meets Gandalf the wizard, who takes Bilbo and a group of dwarfs on a adventure to reclaim the dwarfs' lost treasure and kill the beast that killed almost all the dwarfs in the castle that it took over. This book is for someone 7+ years old and likes magic, elves, goblins, etc., etc,. etc.
1	An amazing novel: I am sure there are many reviews for this book already, but I will heap more praise upon Tolkien's genius. The Hobbit relates the reader to the character. The story is also adventurous and exciting. I remember the first time I read the book in fifth grade, it thrilled me then, as it thrills me now when reading for the third time. A land of hobbits, dwarves, dragons, and wizards. The adventure is suspenseful and well worth the time. After reading the rest of Tolkien's books, I appreciate the Hobbit even more. It is a small part of his work, but the detail he uses to weave a creative plot is astounding.
0	The epitemy of Fantasy: This "book" is a travesty to everything ever written. Swoar, lil' fools wack for REALL. J.R.R. Tolkien is clearly a man of minimal intellect and an insufficient grasp on what a a real novel is composed of. Boy, ain't nuffin' but a playa-hatin scrub!. Daniel Miller, anonymous in Kentucky (MMS!)
1	Best book ever!: Why 5 stars? Because it's the best freaking book EVER!The Hobbit has,1. Adventure 2. An awesome villain and finally 3. An epic group of characters!
1	The Hobbit: I had never read this book, but having enjoyed The Lord of the Rings, I thought it worth reading this earlier tale. It is sometimes too predictable with a satisfactory outcome. I look forward to seeing the film.
1	Trail Blazer: Arrived on time in New,Unwrapped Condition. Amazon Connects with Topnotch Retailers that provideGreat Customer Service.
1	Great listening: We bought this at our daughter's request. When we saw that it would take11 hours to hear the whole book, we asked her if we could "test" it on a drive to Phoenix (and back) at Christmas. With her approval (we'll take it to her this spring when we visit her in China), we were entertained for the whole trip plus another hour when we got home. Now we've seen the first of the three Hobbit movies, too and were more familiar with the characters than we would have been without the great preview.
1	Classic: We bought this book to read together with our son. It was a great experience. We also got a few Lego sets to bring the book to life.
1	Fantasy Master: One of the best fantasy novels ever. Many have already outlined why this is such a masterful story, so I won't replicate that effort.I enjoyed this book as a young grade schooler and plan to re-read it again and again. This is the kind of book you want to read out loud to your grandchild and to the kid in you.
1	The Hobbit: Although The Hobbit tends to be a childs book it is a must read before the "Lord of the Rings" saga.It is also about to hit the big screen.
1	A Magical Tale: I loved The Hobbit. It was a fun, delightful read. Tolkien was obviously the narrator, and he had a way of inserting little quips that would make me chuckle. The story moved along quite nicely, as it was short, and you ended the book feeling like the story had come full circle. I would recommend that everyone should read this - it's a classic!
1	Enjoyed reading again after so many years!: I read the book many years ago in high school and wanted to read it again before I saw the movie. It is a classic and I loved being introduced to all the characters once again.
0	Hobbits are just another type of Elf: I would strongly recommend this book to those who play "Dungeons and Dragons." I honestly don't care which of the 5000 races of little people someone belongs to. This book had a few highly actioned and interresting parts in the book, but overall this book is dull, and Bilbo the main charachter complained most of the time.For instance, there was often a large gap between action scenes. I was really looking up to the death of Smaug, a charachter who's ego was expanded into godlike preportions, died a pitiful death, with hardly any contact with the adventuring gang. And finally, my favorite charachter(Gandalf)left prematurely.
1	supurbe: Cain CoxELA 8The Hobbit/JRR TolkienBook review10/1/03The Hobbit by JRR Tolkien is about a hobbit named Bilbo. In the book the hobbit gets taken on the adventure of his life.In one of his adventures he meets some trolls that have a cave behind them and he is sent to look in the cave to look. But before he can get into the cave he gets caught by the trolls. The only reason that he was alive was that a wizard saves him.I thought that this was an exciting and adventurers book. It had a great plot and a great story about wizards, hobbits, dwarfs, goblins, dragons and elves. If you like that kid of thing you should read it. It's great for all ages.The hobbit was a great book with a fabulous plot. So if you like adventures you should read the book the hobbit by JRR Tolkien. I would recommend this book to people who like fantasy.
1	Perfect compatibility: Checked with Sears and they could no longer help. I had one remote that I had to hold just right to get it to work.I ordered two of these remotes. The compatibility match is perfect. These are exactly as described. It took me longer to get the ladder out, to reach the green button on the back of the garage door opener unit, then it did to set the frequency on the two I ordered. Took approximately15 or 20 seconds to set the frequency on both remotes. Extremely easy. Perfect match, perfect replacement. Wish I had ordered sooner.
0	Didn't work: This product tho it seemed to match our current one, failed to synchronize with our garage door opener. It didn't work at all. A waste
0	The Bad Outweighs the Good: This could have been such a wonderful book. The prose was elegant, the story was intense and everything came together well.Except for the fact Buzz Bissinger has a vendetta against sabermetrics and sabermetricians. The attacks on the book "Moneyball" and the flipant remarks attacking others (like me) who love the game was sickening.I would avoid this book and look elsewhere for that "summer classic."
1	Book was good: The book arrived in excellent condition. It was a fast enjoyable read. Although, I feel the contents were geared to a woman no older than forty.
0	I don't like it: As a man, I bought this book to help me try to understand how women think. This book scared me. The author seems to have a narrow idea of what men are. I found it sexist and almost racist. Women that read and follow the guidelines of this book will only find men that the author describes. Selfish and lazy. I was going to give this book to Goodwill, but I think that I will burn it instead.
0	This is the problem with American Women: If you think this is how a woman should act in a relationship, you have another thing coming. Athough I suggest to you that we neither want a meek woman but someone inbetween who can hold her own and still be a lady.Such a gross misrepresentation what a man wants..ugh.
1	Beth: This book is fabulous. I am a 25 year old female who has always been "the nice girl." It's not as if I haven't had relationships. Yet, even in those relationships, I always felt like a "doormat." My friends and I always wondered why the guys we didn't like kept coming around. We would sit in the car and read this book aloud to each other. This book is liberating, and I recommend it to any woman looking to take control of herself and her love life.
1	Why Men Love Bitches - THE BEST there is!: Sherry is an EXCELLENT and THE GREATEST writer there is!!! A MUST read for all women out there!!! This book is the absolute BEST! "T-H-E B-E-S-T!!!" The contents in the book are amazingly true and "real"!!! No other relationship books can be compared to this! You just HAVE to read it and you will see why Sherry is so AWESOME!!! Be your own judge! I love it!!!Sherry teaches you all the PRINCIPLES that EVERY WOMAN should know.... to believe in yourself... and put yourself first.... start counting yourself as Number1 instead of Number 2!!!Sherry, please keep writing!!! You are truly AMAZING!!! You are a Goddess!!!
1	One awesome book for any woman.: I was the "nice girl" before reading this book. This book has helped me so much when it comes to dating. I find myself being happier in relationship than ever before. If you give to much to any man in your life I STRONGLY suggest that you buy this book you won't regret it. I'm even going to buy this book for my closest girlfriends. Before dating another guy read this book he will help you out tremendously.
0	Not completely accurate: This book is directed towards a certain type of women, to advise them them on how to act towards a certain type of man. Contrary to what it suggests, not all men are alike, no more than all women are alike. This book seems to categorize all men as chauvinists, and all women (at least the target audience) as dumb blonds. Doesn't necessarily work out that way. If you are having social issues of the sort that this book alludes to, you might want to see a counselor instead of taking advice from someone who is probably (as the title suggests), a Bitch!
1	I can't believe how amazing this book is.: I am/was your classic doormat kind of girl and I realized that I just might be doing something wrong. One day I was discussing this with my friends and she recommended this book. In the first10 pages I learned what exactly I was doing wrong. I recommend this book for every woman who feels like she needs to change herself for the better and no longer wants to be a doormat.
1	great book on dating!: This book is hilarious! But it is also very helpful. I learned a lot of new tatics and approach. Women have a lot of power and when used properly we can get what we want from a man.
1	Wonderful!!: I have told all of my girlfriends single and married about this book. It is right on point and gives very good insight into the males ways of thinking and how we should interact with them. We as women sometimes lose our identity to please a man and it never works. I have always held my own in a relationship for the most part, but I have found new insights into loving myself and loving my man without losing myself in the relationship and have found it totally true that a man appreciates a woman more when she stands up for herself, has a live apart from him and does not make him her world but a part of her world. I can hardly wait to read why men MARRY bitches.
0	I don't know if this really gets to the point: I am a fast reader by nature, but this book took months to get through. Although she made some good points, I think it's pretty much what every other book out there says.
0	WOW!: This book was manipulation and games to the max. I understand why guys think girls are so crazy sometimes, because of books likes this. Some of the things mentioned in this book were okay, but playing games catches up with you and then nobody is happy.
0	The title should be "FOR WOMEN WHO HAVE NO LIFE OUTSIDE OF DATING MEN": If you are a woman who has no life outside of whatever man you are trying to pursue, then this is the book for you.This book pretty much tells women to pretend to have a life outside of your boyfriend or lover, only then will he realize how truly amazing you are.Only then will the man will try to pursue you and feel like he is winning you over, you alpha female you!Man's thoughts: "Gosh, she has friends that she goes to the mall with on Saturdays and yoga in the evenings on weekdays, she's such a busy and important lady. She doesn't need a man in her life, that's why I like her."For all women out there, I know finding the right person is tough.But please stop caring so much about having a relationship with a man.Find your own happiness within yourself.You don't need to read this book to tell you to go out and have a life!!!!!!
1	Girls! It's so true!: I personally loved this book! It gave me a completly different outlook on relatonships and how to hold my own in one. I used to be auch a doormat! Seriously, this book transformed my entire demeanor and has helped me to become a dreamgirl that men respect and ultimatly want. This book gives great advice and real life exapmles of how to deal and be happy with a man. Basically if a man is walking all over you, you are doing something wrong. Man up girl, and dump him! Haha..I would honestly reccomend this book to any woman who is looking to improve herself, her relationships and her overall attitude and confidence level!
1	good video for beginners: This video is a mix of streching and extrememly light toning, if you need a light strech, or need to relax, this is the tape for you! It is done by Greg Smithey and regular people of all ages, anyone can do this!!!
0	A hodge-podge of personal trivia: I doubt this would have been published if Crichton weren't Crichton. Just a hodge-podge of stuff - medical school, a few good travel essays, a lot of paranormal stuff - energy balancing, auras, channeling, etc. etc. I see a lot of readers loved it, but I thought it was a waste of time.
1	Crichton at his best.: The book arrived ahead of the promised date, in fairly good condition.This book blew me away, wish I read it when the author was still alive. I would have made an effort to talk to him about some of his experiences from the book. A MUST read for anyone with an open mind.
1	Not typical Crichton fiction: Travels is a fascinating, truthful, revealing compilation of adventerous essays. It's humorous, silly, terrifying at times, and enlightening. Crichton takes his readers with him in all of his journeys - to places where most people have never been. It reveals what makes Crichton Crichton. The best part of this book is that he doesn't expect you to believe everything. If you think that the paranormal is hokey stuff, then fine, you can believe it is hokey stuff. You can be skeptical about it. I am. But he encourages his readers to experience things for themselves.
1	AKA Bentley Little: Horror writer Bentley Little moonlights in the suspense genre under the pseudonym "Phillip Emmons." Gruesomely original with the most politically incorrect serial killer ever committed to paper. The final setpiece in a Phoenix hospital, is a nail-biter.
1	FYI: Although I haven't read this book by Nicky Cruz, I thought I'd just add my own "2 cents". This is just a bit of trivia about the author. This is the same Nicky Cruz who is mentioned in the book, The Cross and The Switchblade. He was portrayed in the1970's movie, of the same name, by a young Eric Estrada (TV's CHIPS).
0	A Disappointment: I'm going to make this short and sweet. What a disappointment. I also waited with much anticipation for this book and was so upset I almost but a match to it. The ending left me wanting to throw it out the window. I loved all the previous books but like other reviewers I found myself skipping page after page searching for some "action". I'm hoping the next one will be better. Usually I buy the hard copy. I may wait and get it from the library.
0	Very disappointing: If "Clan of the Cave Bear" was as mediocre as this book, its likely that the series would have ended right there. "Clan" was an excellent book -- and the others in the series were also very good -- but this book is very lacking in drama and repetitious to the point of boredom. The detailed research, which was skillfully woven into the story in earlier books and gave life and dimension to the characters and events, appeared in this book as lengthy descriptions which interrupted the story. As an Auel fan, I've eagerly read all of the previous books in this series, and was hoping that the negative reviews on "Shelters" were exaggerated. Sad to say, they're not. The only positive thing about this book is that Auel fans will have a chance to re-enter Ayla's world again after a long wait. I'm hoping that the next book will be better...
0	a long wait for disappointment: after re reading how fire is made ,what seemed like a1000 times I decided this was the most boring book ive read in a long time.
0	Dissapointment: AFter waiting so long I felt cheated after reading this book which could have been summarized in one sentence. Ayla reaches final destination, mates, and has Jondalar's baby. The rest of the book is totally plagarist from the other books in the series. All the events are exactly the same, just the names are changed. There was absolutely no new plots involved. What a shame.
0	Repetition, repetition, reputation: Wonderful series prior to this. Shelters of Stone, however, tarnishes Jean M. Auel's reputation. Quite frankly, I don't believe she wrote it herself.
1	A "must read" book: This book goes with the others books in this series and is a great read. Well worth the money and very gripping.
0	snore.........: I painfully read the entire book just to see if something exciting would happen up to the very end of the book. It didn't.
0	Fans only: What is this series? I guess it is romance, in the same genre as those thick novels with a woman and Fabio on the cover. If one starts this book with that in mind, you won't be disappointed. It still has Ayla inventing everything and healing everyone, and Jondalar is still an amusingly dumb blond with one endearing attribute. The animal friends are still there, wowing the prehistoric residents of France. Auel still manages to make sex scenes tiresome -- singlehandedly she may keep teenagers from having sex because she makes it seem so boring.But a fun bubble-head read nonetheless. Smart of the publisher to release this book in May -- it is the perfect beach read.
0	Boooring!!!: Ugh...how much can one read about the landscape...the rocks...the rivers??? and Ayla & Jondalar having sex?? I skipped through most of the book and was still bored. What a disappointment, after waiting so many years!I do not recommend this book to anyone.I won't be reading any other sequals of the Earth's Children after this one!!
0	A12 Year wait and this is the best she could do?: Repetitive, slow, and too detailed.How could there have been a12 year wait for a book that was for at least the first 700 pages a repetition of the first books? How many times do we need to be told Alya has to go to the bathroom more often now that she is pregnant? Do we have to have her show how to make fire over and over and over? Where is the plot, the suspense, the action?I do not recommend buying this book, get on the waiting list at the library.
1	Worth the wait: I thought the book was very good. It does get a little boring to me because of so much explicit detail written in on everything. The book is around 750 pages but well worth the read. Can't wait for the final book.
0	Tedious: Boring and tedious! Repetitious story line both from earlier books and from within this story -- how many times do you have to tell Ms Auel, I'm not stupid, you know. Hard-to-remember names, and an error-ridden Kindle transcription add to this reader's frustration. I'm new to Kindle and wonder if all Kindle books are subject to transcription errors or did someone forget to edit this one? Tell you what, Amazon, let me be an advance reader, give me the titles for free and I'll edit for you.
0	Same old, same old...but worse: Read the first couple of pages and then skip the next 250. It is all review. Auel should assume that people who are reading this book have read the others and should not spend 250 pages re-hashing what we already know. We already know people will be "amazed" and "disbelieving" of Ayla's and Jondalar's previous adventures. We do not need to sit with them while they tell the story to each of Jondalar's relatives.We also already know Ayla and Jondalar "share pleasures" more and better than any earthly couple ever did or could. I am not reading this story to get a "thrill". In the last book, it got to the point that whenever Auel wrote about pleasures, I just skipped it, because it disturbed the flow of the story. This book was no exception.I want more depth, more story and less review. I haven't given up on the series yet, but if I have to wait another10 years for the next - I won't be buying it.
0	I waited HOW LONG for THIS?: After waiting with great anticipation for12 looonnggg years, I actually took the day off work when my copy arrived so I could immerse myself back in the Ice Age! 300 pages later, I gave up and decided to clean house instead. I now know why the book has the shortened title of SoS - 'cause if I EVER saw a book in distress this is it! I am now perfectly willing to believe all those rumors that Jean is dead - she couldn't possibly have written this drivel.(well actually she did, it was just in books1-4) This has been my favorite series of all time and now, sadly, I don't care if she ever gets around to publishing book 6. Even Ayla's skills as a medicine woman can't revive this victim.
0	Worst Book I have Ever Read!: Jean Auel should return any and all monies she received from the sale of this book to all the tortured readers who had to endure it!
0	Slooooooow: I was a big fan of Auel, right until this book arrived. It's approximately 700 pages long and it took nearly 500 pages before it starts to get interesting. I skipped chunks of pages because they are pure repitition from earlier in the book. I'll probably buy the next one but only because of the first three and to see how it ends. Hopefully Auel won't let us down. If this book was half the length it would potentially have been great. I was disappointed.
0	Bad graphic design.: The first four books, as they originally came out, followed a consistent and attractive design pattern, thus they look like a series on your shelf and are artistically pleasing. The new binding looks completely different -- simplistic, boring -- and the text in no way lines up with that of the previous books. I don't believe they're going to get people to re-buy the earlier books in the new design. And the new design is not a correction to the original design. The decision makers at Crown Publishers have once again shown a lacking in sense of aesthetics and a lack of concern for their customers.
0	Tedious: Sorry but I had alot of trouble even finishing this book. I've read the entire series so far and enjoyed all the others. There are so many characters one needs some sort of outline to keep track of who's who. The dialouge is extremely tedious with far too much small talk that adds nothing but words to the book. I'm thinking Ms Auel wrote this in a hurry to fullfil a contract obligation.
0	The Shelters of Stone: My teenage daughter and I both enjoyed reading this series. This book in particular was full of interesting insight as to how people may have lived and communicated pre-ice age. Very well written and enjoyable to read. Caution -- not for younger readers due to sexual content.
0	No stars, No story: Unfortunately Amazon doesn't let you rate a book with zero stars. How so little could happen in so many pages, I'll never know.
0	Kindle edition rife with typos: I was excited to have the Earth's Children series available for my Kindle, but the OCR errors in "Shelters of Stone" make it almost unreadable. Surely SOMEONE must review the copy before the book is made available for sale? The quality of the story notwithstanding (the plot rather drags, as others have noted), it's incredibly distracting to come across so many mistakes in the text when trying to read the story. Publishers need to institute better quality control when issuing Kindle editions of old manuscripts.
0	Extremely boring and repetitious: I used to be a huge fan of Ayla to the point that I even read the first three books more than once. The fourth book however didn't attract me as much until I had read 200 pages. I find Auel's latest book very boring simply because there is nothing new in the book. The rest of the reviewers explain perfectly how this book has nothing offer so I won't repeat their comments.I wouldn't recommend this book to any friend.
0	The Shelters of Stone: Remembering way back when this series started with The Clan of the Cave Bear, how well and entertaining that and the following books were....till many years later when this book came out, and then the entertainment just stopped and it became a boring read, I lost all interest in the characters.I truly did try to read it through, but I just couldn't do it. I had to stop half-way through. Maybe it was just too long between books, or maybe I've just outgrown the writing.
0	Brainless dribble!: Perhaps I was expecting too much, given the long wait since book four, and considering that I thoroughly enjoyed the other four books in the series. However, this book for me was nothing but a brain dulling barrage of introductions and recaps of the other books in the series. In fact, I must admit that I did not finish reading this book. After 200 pages of pure "nothing," I finally decided to discard it. I had help with this decision, though. A good friend of mine began listening to the book on tapes at the same time I began reading. She finished--only because she has a long commute and nothing better to do--and quickly informed me that absolutely "nothing" happens, that there is no drama, action, or any form of brain teasing within the pages of this new book from Jean Auel.
0	A cure for insomnia: This book is a real snooze. I plan to keep it near my nightstand for the next12 years - just in case I have trouble dozing off. I loved Clan of the Cave Bear and really enjoyed the next 3 books, but this book is nothing more than a 700 page description of the way the continent of Europe looked 30,000 years ago. BORING stuff. As for the brilliant Ayla, she is relegated to a pathetic shell of her former self. I agree with all the other reviewers about the boring sex scenes, rehash of the Clan ways, etc. etc. That hunt on the 2nd day (page 250 thru 280 or so) was very contrived. They were so greedy they had to have 2 hunts? This was done more to show off Ayla's skill and Jondular's spear than to entertain the reader. It seems that way too much in this book is just 'filler'. I will not run out and buy the sixth book Ms. Auel. When I hear it's been published, I'll re-read Clan of the Cave Bear.
0	Agree with "Just A Reader": The author is obsessed with her exploration of the historic sights and forces descriptions of minutiae on us that add nothing to the story; in fact, they take the place of character development and divert the story line.As much as I liked the first three in the series, I put this one down for good just over half through. I would give NO stars if the rating system allowed that.
0	DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK: Like everyone else, I waited for tweleve years for this book.. and I ran out and bought it as soon as I could.I want my money and my nine hours back.The characters are bland. There was no plot, no twists, and just about nothing happening that wasn't either easy to foresee or a rehash of books one through four.Wait till book six comes out, then pick this one up in paperback and skim it. Trust me, I'm trying to save you the anguish of characters you can't get into, events that are just plain silly, and the endless retelling of events that you don't need to be told about if you bothered to read the rest of the series.
0	*sigh* I guess it couldn't last forever: No one is a bigger fan of "The Clan of the Cave Bear" than I am - I've read it cover-to-cover at least10 times since1996. And the same goes for the others in the series (especially "The Mammoth Hunters") which were all really great. I will not be rereading "Shelters," I'm sorry to say. I got the impression that the whole story, inflated to over 700 pages, could have easily fit in the first100 pages of the next book. All the conflict built up to in the last few books - especially the very big question of the Zelandonii's acceptance of Ayla and her Clan background and son - were dismissed entirely. Oops, I guess Jondalar didn't have reason to be worried after all. Kind of makes you wonder why he almost left her behind out of fear of his people's reaction. There's no story here - just constant introduction and repetition. Read it only if you plan to read the 6th, so you won't be lost in a maze of characters.
0	What happened?: I eagerly awaited the coming of this book but after reading it I am sorry I wasted my time. There were so many chances for drama that were missed, so many segments that did nothing to advance the story. What little bit of action that did happen was so weak that is wasn't even action! It seemed to me this book was just a comercial for the next book. The first 4 books are well worth a second read, but this one should be forgotten.
0	Like a Seinfeld Episode....: ...this is a book about nothing. Ms. Auel really phoned this one in, and I couldn't be more disappointed. My advice, if you haven't started the series, is to read the first three, skip four and five, and hope six lives up to the first half of the series. Unless you want a slightly less boring version of a research paper on the topography of Europe 30,000 years ago, stay away. I think it took her twelve years because she kept dozing off.... I NEVER have written a comment on a book before. The only reason I felt compelled to do so now is, after all the anticipation, I feel cheated and let down. Of course, who cares, because of course I'll buy the sixth one too, just to see if things look up. Still, I think I'll wait till it gets to the 2nd-hand store next time.
0	Enough already?: Only reason to continue the series at this point would be to see how many more pages it takes for Ayla to invent The Wheel (and is anyone else as irritated as I am by the constant capitalized spellings for nearly every activity from ceremonies to having sex?) Seriously, I can guess why Auel is constantly rehashing material from earlier books--to hide the lack of a story or interesting new characters--and I had particularly looked forward to meeting Zelandoni, the previous great love of Jondalar's life. For an entertaining and far quicker read on the subject of Stone Age life, read Joan Wolf's trilogy(Daughter of the Red Deer, The Horsemasters, The Reindeer Hunters). I've recently reread the book, and while still giving only two stars, I must say that it reads faster the second time around--maybe because of knowing which segments to skip over altogether!
1	I wish it was longer.: I just finished it and I've got a great big smile on my face. It starts out slow but by the end you want more. Thats half the fun imagining what will be next. If your the earthy type this series is a must read. My all time favorite set of books. Get the series and set off on the adventure of a lifetime. If the next one is truely the last please please make it twice as long.
0	WOULD THE REAL JEAN AUEL STAND UP: Would the real Jean Auel stand up. This book,THE SHELTERS OF STONE, seems like the author had three people read the other books in this series and then had them each pen the chapters. It is a great drop below her other books. No real finality to the problems that were introduced in the last book. And with the new problems introduced in this book, the reader is left with a sense of loss. No closure to Ayla's pain about Durc. No meeting among the Clan and the Zelandonii. Ayla has to be able to strut her stuff for the good of her new people.
0	Ayla is like a prehistoric McGyver: This book is tiresome!!! Took real effort to read it all the way to the end. I was very much looking forward to this book which turned out to be a real snore. By the end of the first hundred pages I felt like Ayla was a prehistoric McGyver. Good grief, the needle, bow and arrow, etc., I wondering how it was she didn't invent electricity (wait, no, that was Ben Franklin). The effort to get to the end of definitely not worth it.
1	Ties up loose ends: I gave it five stars because I liked it. I considered giving it four stars because I don't think this book will hold much for a person who hasn't read the previous books in the series. It ties up loose ends and sets up an interest for upcoming adventures, but it doesn't carry a lot of excitement of its own. Obstacles are too easily overcome. This book works well as a step in a larger series, but I don't think it could stand on its own.
1	classic: read this book and it was the same as the movie or the series that I saw a good read from cover to cover
1	love it: I read this for the first time about 2 years ago. And when the books' free....This book (and the books after it) were great. Lousia May Alcott made 4 girls, that seem real. 4 girls with problems that girls have now.I especially loved the bond that the March family had. How happy they were when their father came home....Wonderful book. 5 stars.
1	Grosset & Dunlap Illustrated Jr. Library Ed.: I'm sure there are plenty of reviews on the actual story, so I'll just comment on this particular edition of Little Women. I'm referring to the Grosset & Dunlap Illustrated Junior Library edition. I found this at a local Borders and was immediately attracted to the cover illustration. This is a beautiful book. There are many illustrations throughout the book, both in color and in back and white (the majority are in black and white).When I looked it up on Amazon, I was a little hesitant about buying this book because I had read reviews stating that it only contained the first half of the story (288 pages). The book I bought (at Borders) contains the entire story (643 pages). So, if you like the appearance of this particular edition, but are put off by the lack of the second half, it is available with the complete story. Just be careful when making your selection.
0	Little Women: I found this version to be very trite and the voices did not match the depth of the characters. I was quite disappointed compared with other audiobooks that I have listened to.
1	Wonderful book, very tasteless introduction!: The book was absolutely wonderful!! But the introduction was written in very bad taste. The insinuations were offensive and with out just cause!!Had I read the introduction before I purchased the book, I would have chosen another copy. I had purchased it and then read the introduction, so as I write, the pages have been cut out of this book. Louisa May Alcott did not deserve the insinuations from this person.
1	This was a really good book , and was very interesting !: This book was a wonderful story, which was very similar to real life. I liked the romance in the story, and how there was a little sadness in the book as well. This book was also definately worth reading even though it was long. The text in the story was extremely descriptive and the whole plot of the story is definately #1 for a lot of the books that I have read. It was a book that was hard to put down, with all the struggles and problems the characters overcame in it. I advise mostly everyone to read this book, because it is pretty easy to read, and you seem too be done not long after you have started! By, SLG & JDG
1	Greaaaaaat Book!You will never want to put it down!!: Louisa May Alcott weaves a wonderful and touching tale about the March sisters:Amy,Meg,Beth and Jo.The way she describes it,tells the story,has a touch of old-fashioned charm in it,taking one back to the days of long gowns,bonnets,rich lords and ladies and the such.The four sisters' personalities are also vividly described in Louisa Alcott's eyes.
0	It's Only the First Half of the Book: I bought this book as a gift to impress the receiver. To my shock, the receiver told me the book was very nice indeed but it contained only the first half of the book. I did not see anywhere where we are told about this being only half of the book unless you include the Library Journal description.
1	Good Book: This book is an old favorite love the old movie and loved re reading about simpler times comforting and enjoyable easy reading with some funny times Happy sad and is good to get lost in am sight impaired and have not long had my Kindle It is fantastic amozon have been great and easy to use This book was one of my first and I am really enjoying the story of The March Family their ups and down and will look forward to reading the next in the series
1	A story about four girls who change their whole lives.: A brilliant book of true lives. Of great hopes and tragedies. A story someone has to read till the end.
1	Little Women: "Little Women" is a classical novel of four sisters, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy. These sisters live with their Marmee while their father s away in the Civil War. They overcome hardship by using the only thing they have, love. They each have their individual and unique talents. They each find their true love, and live in happiness. Louisa May Alcott, the author writes a timeless classic.
0	boring boring boring!: zzzzz zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz zzzzzzzzzzzzzzz z z zzzzzzzzzzz zzzzzzzzzzzz z z zzzzzzzzzzzz zzz z z z z z z z z zz
0	A Great Book: This is a GREAT book! I was thrilled to find it at my library, because everyone told me that I should read it. This unique story shows how the March sisters deal with problems together. (I have two sisters, so I can relate to that). The four girls, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy, form a tight bond as they deal with frienships, money, marriages, and much more, during the civil war, when their father is away. When their mother, "Marmee" goes to help their sick father, they struggle to find any help for Amy, who is dreadfully ill with the scarlet fever. This, and many more problems fill their lives, and they learn to live a better life as they mature and grow strong within each other. This is a wonderful classic, and I encourage you to read the book,watch the movie, or listen to the cassete (of which I have done all three!).
1	Compact & Durable: I received my first of these flashlights as a gift. After it was stolen out of my truck, I bought two more. It is compact and durable. The xenon light is very bright and the LEDs provide a good close distance flood light. The best features are the compactness and light options. The negative aspects are the special battery requirements and the weight. I still like this flashlight better than the MAGlite.
1	good overview: This book gives to a foreign lawyer who represents customers of securities dealers a good overview of the american securities dealers law and the procedures his clients have to go through.
1	Enjoyable Family Movie: I had never read or even heard of the book so I was able to approach this movie with no bias at all. I found the movie to be pleasant and enjoyable. The roles were all convincingly played and I found myself really mad at the Scott Wilson character, Judd Travers; Wilson did a great job at being a despicable villain. The other major and supporting roles are well cast and played by seasoned actors and actresses which contribute to the overall ambience of the movie.Blake Heron plays the part of Marty Preston, our stories hero, and is convincing as the young lad who falls in love with a dog. The dog is in trouble and turns to Marty for help; Marty reacts to the need and decides the dog is his responsibility. That decision is the beginning of Marty's time of testing that will lead to an ending that won't disappoint.This is a first class family movie and one the entire family will enjoy.
0	A bad film adaptation of a great book: It really is sad to see Phills Reynold Naylor's great masterpiece about a beagle puppy trampled on like this. This film was not at all faithful to the book. The first difference is that in the book Shiloh had a black spot just behind his left ear about one inch in front of his leg. In the movie, the spot is way over on his back! In the book, Shiloh's tail was a couple inches long. In the movie, it's like a foot!The classic "this little piggy goes to market" scene has been ommitted, and scene where Shiloh tries to hump the kid's leg was just plain unneccesary. C'mon, this is supposed to be a family movie! Avoid this and read the fantastic book trilogy instead(which I also wrote a comprehensive review for)
1	Very good but doesn't follow book: We loved the movie very much...my 9 and 5 year old girls loved it, especially the ending. We didn't find it too scary at all.However, both my 9 year old and I enjoyed the book far more...it gave such a deeper insight into Marty's heart, and into the world of a boy and his dog. We were both very affected by the book; it made an impression on us that the movie did not.I especially did not like the addition of another child, a girl, into the story. It seemed Hollywood wanted to add a little childhood flirting to make the movie more sellable. That just served as a distraction from this fine story. There were many differences from the book, but this was the one that irked me.It still was a very good movie with a heartwarming ending. If you haven't read the book, you'll like it even more cause you won't be comparing differences.
0	Awful Book Cover and Content...: When you first see this book you figure, well the content has to be better than the cover. As amazing as it might sound, the content is even worse. The amount of errors really baffled me and stressed me out. Trying to look up things and the entire layout is just awful. How awful books like this get published is beyond my knowledge. Perhaps someone lost a bet or Schiller owns their soul. Maybe if your a 900 player this would help you break1000. If your getting this book thinking your gonna be able to defend d4. I guess your gonna have to find out the hard way how shoddy this book is. A bad chess player that writes awful books is a scary thing. I think Ken Smith and Schiller should start their own club. Donate your money to a good charity or buy yourself something worth having. The only use this book has is the hope of being burned when no logs are left.
1	A century in the life of The Hog: Clearly a grand advertisement & a fine way to take a peek at the transformation of The Hog. Along the way you'll catch glimpses of both ten decades of advertising & dressage styles.If you're expecting to see the development of the mystique we've come to associate with The Hog, you will be disappointed for those who make The Hog are not necessarily those with whom it is associated. I don't think I've seen so many squeaky-clean, carefree people up close, sans helmets too!Actually, a fascinating book & certainly one any lover of motorbikes, the open road & social styles will enjoy.
1	A classic in pristine condition.: The problem with old (esp. foreign) film is that it can be hard to find good editions. Classics like this, which have already survived the test of time, tend to get picked up by two-bit distributors and released in the most disgraceful of manners. Thank god for the Criterion Collection; This lavish transfer will not disappoint those with a healthy aesthetic. Reading a lot of the other reviews, I've noticed that they've mentioned something about the sound quality: it's true, even in the newly restored edition there are some imperfections, but I don't think that is enough to merit less than 5 stars (maybe 4.5, but that's not an option.)
1	much cheaper at target: I haven't even taken this out of the box yet but I got it at target for $50! This item is definitely overpriced.
1	Ax Genrich - 'Highdelberg - Super Session' (Germanofon): At (one time), the insanely-rare1975 solo effort by the original Guru Guru guitarist {1970-73). But some of us might ALREADY have this lp on another title - it's included on the Admission To Music pressing 'Best Of Ax Genrich,1971-96' (see my review). Tunes that make this title a keeper are tripping "Der Platzhirsch", "Super Normal Rider", "A National Affair" and the quirky "Acid Drops And Sweet Wine". Line-up: Ax Genrich-guitar & vocals, Hellmut Hattler (Kraan)-bass & vocals, Dieter Moebius-synthesizer, fellow Guru Guru member Mani Neumeier-percussion, Peter Wolfbrandt (Kraan)-guitar and Jan Pride-drums. Didn't even know about this particular reissue until recently. A must-have.
1	Great Play: I strongly recommend this play. It's a powerful piece and especially great for women to use as cuttings for auditions.
0	Louder than a Diesel engin: The pump sounded like a good deal--SOUNDED is the word that needs to be taken into account here. I bought the pump for a reef aquarium. Before I installed the pump all I could here was the trickle of water from the other pumps. Turned this one on, and I thought I was in the middle of the freeway. LOUD!!! Other reviewers had said it was loud--I should have listened. I will be returning it this week. HyperFlow--It should be named HyperSound
1	In Times of Trial: Cheryl Brodersen is a gifted teacher. She's candid, humorous and real. I would say she has both her parents' (Chuck and Kay Smith) gifts of exhortation and teaching. Speaking from her heart, she helps you find God's grace in and through your trials.
0	Agree with other reviews, doesn't last long: Overall I liked the case, but as two people previous to myself pointed out the belt clip falls out too easily. Within two weeks of purchase the soft leather that was supposed to hold the plastic tab in place had stretched to the point where it was freely rotating. After less then two months, it plastic tab falls out entirely, dropping the phone to the ground at inconvenient moments.It looks like I'll be looking for another case again.
0	read VICSARJOO's review - more entertaining than the film: I could hardly believe this film was being high-listed for possible DVD release during the Amazon.com voting... let's be honest, it is not that good a movie (neither acting nor plot nor cinematography), unless you have an intense need to see some gymnastics and Kurt Thomas. But do make a point of reading VICSARJOO's review, for a delicious satire of over-blown and mis-guided reviews. If you enjoy that review (one of my favorites) there are some other classics by him if you link to his other reviews, though some seem a little half-hearted compared to this review by him. Cannibal Women in the Avocado Jungle of Death is another fine example of his dry wit. Thank you VICSARJOO for making me smile.
1	Excellent: Finally such an amazing movie appears on DVD! It is no wonder Ingrid Bergman won the Academy Award for this film. She is spectacular as an abused wife, driven mad by her husband.The ONLY reason I gave it 4-stars is because you can get it cheaper somewhere else. The actual publisher's list price is $14.99 and I'm not entirely sure why Amazon offers it for almost $2 more. This is the same with the Masterpiece Edition Alice in Wonderland. Amazon lists the price as $29.99, but in stores the list price is $24.99. Curiouser and curiouser.
1	Absolutely mesmerizing: I bought this movie based on a recommendation made to me years ago that I had completely forgotten. What a waste of time. I haven't seen a movie this engrossing in many, many years. The acting is superb and you just can't believe what you're seeing, or take your eyes from it. In the age of "Eyes Wide Shut" and similar movies where sex is used so freely to capture your attention, it is refreshing to see pure acting and story-telling keep your eyes wide open and fixed on the movie. Highly recommended!
1	Interesting: This is a very interesting movie, considering that now the term "gaslight" is being used to describe a form of abuse. I had never known what it was until a friend mentioned it a while back and then another friend recently mentioned this movie. I was delighted to watch it here on Amazon and do love the old black and white movies. The setting is so wonderfully done & the acting is marvelous. This is overall a good movie to watch, regardless of the form of abuse and message being sent across.
0	iNCREDIBLY STUPID FILM: This film really made me angry and pissed off I bothered watching it. The characters were cardboard and I can't believe Ingrid Bergman starred in this junk.The main character totally lost it, believing all what her husband was saying about her. She was totally unthinking in the whole episode until it was revealed that her husband was a con.
1	I have to say this!!!: There are already over twenty reviews of this movie at this site, but I had to put my two cents worth in.Gaslight is the earliest of Bergman's works I have seen.We know from studies on facial expression and nonverbal communication that the face is difficult to read because of the rapidity of movement of the many features of the face...eyes, mouth, checks, chin. But I swear, watching this film makes me believe that Bergman could command the movement of her hair folicles and skin pores. There are facial movements in this film that absolutely cannot be seen with the naked eye. It appears that she has not moved a muscle yet she has conveyed a powerful emotion.That's why Bergman must be in the top ten actresses of all times.The story was good, but watching Ingrid was superb!
0	You Know What They Say About Sequels: I loved "The List of 7", but this book pales next to it, and is a disappointment. The characters and story are good. But Sparks' fall from grace and the things he does during it are disappointing and I think unnecessary to the story. It takes away from his lustre as being the inspiration for Sherlock Holmes. This is not a book I will read again.
0	BIG DISAPPOINTMENT: I thought the author couldn't do worse than his job with The List of 7--how wrong I was! The 6 Messiahs is an endless stream of predictable moments and horrible plot development. Characters and situations seemed trite and confusing and the last part of the novel was a complete waste. I still believe Frost has the potential for great exciting fiction, but somehow he fails to deliver.
0	SAVE YOUR MONEY this isnt a repair manual: I own dozens of Haynes and Chilton manuals and they actually show you how to service something. This book goes over NOTHING. It gives very basic info that doesn't help you at all. I was working on a10yr old Duetz and it had a few pages on 70's models but no spec sheet or repair info on anything. I ended up having to pay someone to service it because I couldn't track down specs and apparently neither could the author of this book. WASTE OF MONEY
1	The Best Clarke You'll Probably Never Read: This book is out of print and pretty hard to find, but if you ever come across a copy of it I highly reccommend you pick it up. It is a masterpiece of speculative essays. In it, Clarke accurately predicts many things... of course lots of things about space and satellite communications, and even an accurate description of the internet! Also of note are essays on what we should do if we have contact with an alien race, a debunking of UFO sightings (much needed), a debunking of the cliche "nothing is impossible" with a listing of things that are, much talk on the speed of light and relativity, and of course a lot about space. The two most interesting essays in my view are one that speculates on what the Star of Bethleham (Clarke settles on a supernova). Also, there is the short essay "God and Einstein" which is one of the most thought-provoking things I have ever read in my life. Highly reccommended.
1	A beautiful song: I got "I hope You Dance" for my eight year old who is a dancer.She looks so sweet dancing to it.It is a beautiful song.I also got "A Song For My Son" for my mother groom dance with my son at his wedding in June. I love this song too.Thanks to some great writers and singers both my children have a special song from me.
0	Disappointed: I bought this album just for the 'I Hope You Dance' song that I liked so much on the radio. I was very disappointed to find the song had been 'redone' with somebody called the Sons Of The Desert, whoever they are. It detracted so much from the original that I returned the album.
1	It is a necessity for anyone over 50!: This is a workbook-for both those comtemplating death or planning for it as an eventuality. It is also an instructional book on various methods of dealing with property so that one's wishes are fulfilled after death. Even young adults should have this to help parents or friends deal with loved ones with fatal or potential fatal diseases.
0	Me quede aterrada con ese final: Isabel Allende tiene una forma unica y peculiar de escribir. Me gustan mucho sus libros, pero tiene un problema: da demasiados detalles y se sale de la trama. Esta era una fantastica historia, sin embargo, no le dio la importancia que debio darle al personaje. Se intereso mas en describir la vida en chile y otras cosas que le restaban importancia a lo que verdaderamente la tenia: la historia de Eliza. No es que no me haya gustado, si me gusto, pero el final es algo tragico e inesperado. Me quede con las ganas de saber que paso despues. Se habra quedado con tao'chien? se habra reconciliado con Miss Rose? Eso nunca lo vamos a saber!
0	no es tan buena: Esta novela es entretenida, pero definitivamente no es el mejor trabajo de Isabel Allende. El final no deja mucho que decir. Mi recomendación es que lean otras novelas de Isabel Allende, como "La Casa de los Espiritus", que es mucho mejor que ésta.
0	defect merchandise: i purchased a sony clie pegt615 on08-15-02 at compusa/madisonWi. I found that it didn't beam and took it back for an exchange model, same item only to find that this one didn't beam either. (the technician at the store confirmed the defect). i decided to reverse the purchase for cash. on our way out ot the store we found that the display model had the same defect.this tok a hunk of time out of our short vacation unfortunately not with a happy ending.angie siewert
0	be careful: be very careful. I have a sony clie and it broke 2 months after i got it. is started getting white spots under the screen, then the digitizer was going crazy and I had to reset it after 5 min of use. I then put it in my pocket and walked to my room and the screen broke. why do they call them pocket Pc's if you cant put them in your pocket with out them breaking? and be aware that I took very good care of it. It was a waste of [price].
1	Great Magazine: We love this magazine. My husband and I are planning a move to Maine and this magazine is a fun read for us.
1	Excellent Book! Great Examples!: This book covers almost every aspect of Exchange that you will need to pass. It also has study questions that are almost identical to the ones that you will encounter on the test. The CBT that comes with the book is useless though.
1	Good book with detail information: This study guide not only lets me pass the exchange 5.5 exam, but she provides a very useful information about the exchange 5.5 in which I can't find from other MCSE books. I quite enjoy to study the chapter12 ( Managing an exchange Environment) and chapter16 (Migrating to exchange). Whatever you choose this book for exam or knowledge, that's a good choice.
1	HANGMAN'S DIARY WITH A VIGOROUS STYLE: Franz Schmidt's diary is written in a pity, vigorous style which probably reflects the way he went about his unenviable business. The supporting material is just what is needed to make us understand the world of Franz Schmidt.
0	Great Features, Poorly built: Bought the Yepp 700 online exactly a year ago, and it is now broken. The battery case will not shut. (This has happened to many other customers. BUYER BEWARE.)However, the mp3 player does have nice features.-Good Sized Memory256 mb is alot of storage. You can get about 70 songs with that. Buy the media card. It's cheap.-Slick lookingThe yepp is very nice looking. It is also pretty small. Good to exercise with.-Remote controlIts nice that they put this here, but it is pretty worthless. The LCD is wothless, and the FM tuner on this is EXTREMELY WEAK!- Voice RecorderGood feature.In summary, nice features, but poorly built. If you want to take a chance on the mp3 player, go right ahead.
0	Not a best buy: Yepp 700H is nice looking but apparently only works with iTunes1.1 or1.2 on the Mac platform. iTunes is on 3.0 with 2.0.4 being the last working version that ships with Apple products. It is useless to say Mac compatible.On a PC, the unit caused my computer to crash and repairs to software loads needed to be done to recover. So I was not able to get satisfaction via that route either.May be a good idea to just ...go- and get a iPod for Mac or PC.The buttons on the Yepp are difficult to use unless you have tiny fingers, the rocker switch slips and it's easy to depress the play function while rocking, confusing your input. The remote is cool though. The FM Tuner worked medium-well.
0	bad: nanci needs to get back to her roots. I would just like to hear some new work from the "old" nanci. This cd is terrible
1	Nanci Griffith album: I thoroughly enjoy this album. It has been a while since I purchased a CD of Nanci. I was not disappointed. The selections were excellent.
1	Fresh - clean, fresh, and very alluring: I originally wore Desire by dunhill. A salesgirl asked me to test Fresh because she liked it. ever since, I wear nothing else. I receive numerous compliments on my cologne all the time. it is a very clean and fresh fragarence,the kind men Desire.
1	No one did it better: In my opinion, Charles Dickens remains the writer who defined the art of characterization in the19th century. This novel contains a bevy of characters that the readers will find unforgettable. The haunting figure of Miss Havisham has stayed with me since my10th grade literature class (almost 30 years ago) and my recent rereading of the novel brought her horrid existence into full view again. The plot has twists and turns and although I found myself having to stop reading and letting certain episodes sink into my understanding, the beauty and scope of the writing is truly remarkable. As a young student of Dickens, I resisted the long descriptions and difficult dialogue and I don't remember loving the book when I read it the first time. As an adult, however, my admiration for the novel is undeniable.
1	A Very True Side of Human Nature: Charles Dickens' novel Great Expectations explores the side of human nature that many do not like to read in novels. In the United States, in the 21st Century, people would rather read about romantic-style plots where all turns out well for the protagonists. Dickens, however, chooses to illuminate what man can really be capable of: betrayal, duplicity, unfaithfulness, and a handful of other negative characteristics.Definitely an interesting novel, Great Expectations will undoubtedly have its audience intrigued and constantly pondering.I would highly recommend this masterpiece.
1	Enjoyed it more now than in high school: Get characters. All kinds of emotional confrontations. Some things would be politically incorrect now. Loved it. Nice break from some of the thrown together single topic stories I've read recently.
1	In repsonse to "A reader from St. Louis, MO": You said no one who is still is high school will understand this book. That is not entirely true. I am in seventh grade. I not only loved the book, I understood it too. I have done character analyses (for instance: Bentley Drummle had a troubled childhood) and critisized Pip's character. My mom insists that he's a "loser" - but, then again, she never did have that much insight into character. The poor guy is in love so he can hardly see straight! Anyway, I don't pretend that I'm average, because I'm not. But I enjoyed it and understood it.
0	didn't live up to my expectations: I had to read this book this year for my English class. At first I was interested, when Pip was a child, but I quickly became sick and tired of it's boring nature. I am in the honors program in my school, and we only had about 2 and a half weeks to read it, but it seemed like 2 and a half years. I was disappointed most because this massive plot builds up, and I was waiting for something to happen, but nothing really did. Furthermore, it was a bit hard to understand, especially since my mind was drifting, becuase it is hard to pay attention to this book.
1	A Deeper Pip: Worth re-reading as an adult. This was mandatory reading in middle school. Nobody of that age could get the full story with all its nuances at that age. It's like reading a new book. What a wordsmith Charles Dickens was.
1	You can never go wrong with Dickens: How nice to reread an old classic as an adult, instead of in the classroom. A wonderful novel of Pip who comes into his "great expectations" via an unknown benefactor -- who he believes to be Miss Havisham. We see how the influence of money and position affect Pip's relations with his family and former neighbors, and not necessarily for the better. There are lots of surprise twists and turns in the plot, especially about Miss Havisham and her adopted "daughter" Estella and her true parentage.As always, a Dickens novel is peopled with wonderful and unusual characters that eventually all play a part in telling the story. I understand that there were two endings of this book published. The version I read had only one ending and I don't know which one it was. I will have to search out another version of this book to see which I liked best.
0	BO-RING!: This book by far is the worst piece of shi--garbage I have ever laid my eyes on. The story has a skeleton, and a little bit of meat (and I like meat), but mostly, it's just fat. Especially the second stage of Pip's expectations, which finds Pip devoid of any characterizations beyond "I'm rich and you're not," and "Oh, how I do love the lady Estella." It's enough to make you vomit. Mr. Dickens should have made this a much shorter novel, or maybe even a short story. It still would have been boring, but maybe not as boring.
0	Long-Winded, Excruciating to Read and Finish: I had to read this for a high school summer reading list. It was the worst reading experience I ever had, and I love reading books. I cried several times trying to plug through the long-winded (obviously Dickens paid by the word) presentation. While some themes are mildly interesting, there were no scenes that captured my attention or held it for any period of time. This book might be great as an adult (which I'll gladly never know), but definitely not as a16 year old. Sucks sucks sucks.Note to Teachers and Principals, please don't assign this to your high school students. There are so many better and more captivating books. This was the first book I ever read that truly took the joy out of reading for me.
1	Ever the best of friends!,...: ...this book and I are! I had to keep reminding myself that this story was fiction, otherwise I probably would have gotten much more emotional about it than I did. Many of the emotions Pip went through, I have also at some point. What doesn't kill you, makes you stronger (or at least very sick... poor Pip!).
1	Classical Literature: Great Expectations was the greatest book that I've ever read. The way that the book was put together always left you wanting to know more. The book was told by a young boy named Phillip Pirrup, that falls madly in love with a young lady name Estrella. He ends up being sent away to England to become a young gentleman, and strays away from the love of his life. A great deal of scandal goes on, and if I tell you anymore than you'll know what happens, but I will tell you this. If you like a dramatic sope-opera filled with love, suspense, and action than you will find this book astounding. I can tell you I loved this bok, and I'm sure you will too.
1	Great Book!: I had to read this for my AP English class. At first, it didn't catch my attention, but to my english teacher's urging (Mrs. Brodmerkel) I read on. Actually, if she wasn't there to explain each chapter after we had read it, it wouldn't have been As good. This was a great book, and I think everyone should have to read it. There are so many different social conditions that still pertain to life today. Dickens does well in making this novel timeless.
1	The book was kind of confusing, but the idea was great.: It took me a little while to get into the story and get to know all the characters, but once I did I couldn't put the book down. Charles Dickens is a wonderful writer, and Great Expectations prooved it.
0	Overrated, worthless, and so very boring: This book reminds me of algebra, its boring, time-consuming, worthless, and you will never have to use this in your whole life. Never! So when you're teacher asks you to read this book, don't do it. Read the Cliff Notes or watch the Wishbone version.
1	Long, entertaining Dickens story for the car.: I listened to the unabridged audio tape version of this book narrated by Michael Page. It's one of those deals where you listen to each tape entirely on the left channel, then play the whole tape again on the right channel to get the next part of the story. Which is kind of awkward, since you forget which channel you were on if you also use your stereo for music; but these editions are probably the least expensive (by the hour) audio tapes you can buy.I think Dickens' tendency toward exhaustive descriptions works a lot better when you're listening to it in the car than when you're reading it in print. I might never have had the patience to read the actual book while sitting in a chair, but listening to it in the car was pretty entertaining. Colorful characters, humor, suspense, unexpected plot twists; I can picture a lot of it in my mind even now. A recommended story.
1	still a classic: Don't waste the classics on kids. I remember having to read and write book reports on musty old classic books in school, dull and boring. Now I am ready to enjoy these books. Great Expectations shows how much of our lives are lived on incomplete information. The hero assumes that he knows who is guiding and helping him to live and grow beyound his simple beginnings, only to discover at the end that nothing he assumed was true. The hero does live up to the expectations of his benefactor, and beyond the expectations of many others. He also finds out what it is to be given a better future and how much you owe to those that believe in you. I enjoyed this story and recomend you read (reread) this enlighting story of growing up.
1	Beyond my Expectations: I know for sure now why Charles Dickens is such a famous author for works other than A Christmas Carol. The reputation of the book and the author speak for themselves. I was overwhelmed with the quality of Dickens' writing, the intricate nuances of the plot and the many surprise twists. The illustrations in the book plus the alternate ending were also bonuses. I could not be more complimentary of this book and plan to read many more Dickens works starting with David Copperfield. Great Expectations is now one of my favorite books of all time.
0	Profoundly worthless.: Just think of all the trees cut down to make all the additions of this classicly boring novel. This ranks with Catch-22 and Huckleberry Fin as one of the worst novels yet published in the English language. Was there a plot? No. Don't kid yourself. The fool author made it up as he went along not caring if it made sense or if the characters had any meaning. I hate this novel with a passion so great it scares even me. I'd like to see all copies burned. Okay, not really. That's a little extreme. But, at least take this garbage out of school curriculums. Its' making us stupid, making us believe Pip's world is what the world really is. Pip if a fool that got dumped too many times and where's the sex. Was Dickens scared of it. I believe that all great novels should have sex in them. It brings some humanity to them . Great Expectations is a fantasy on level with the Bible but worse, tragicly worse.
1	Finally, some clarity!: I have a pile of XML books on my desk. They all seem to assume too much or assume to little. Those written at my level appear to be written with the "stream of consciousness" approach to technical authoring. This book is a breath of fresh air. As a novice with only a basic understanding of XML, I jumped right into the chapter on schemas and felt I had a very strong grasp of it in just an evening. Every topic was explained with clarity, and, yet it did not seem too slow or dull. The code samples included line-by-line explanations. If I got it just by looking at the sample, I could move on. Otherwise, the explanations were there to illuminate the sample for me. The review and exercises at the end of each chapter follow the collegiate textbook formula. Why is it a formula? Because it works! What a sense of accomplishment to get to the end and be able to answer the questions and perform the suggested exercises.
0	Other reviewers must work for the author: The book doesn't show a user how to use the lang. in a real world environment. The examples in the book are to simple for the user to understand how to transfer the in to something a user can use.
1	Sorprendente y entretenido: Me recordó aquellos libros de la Generación Kronen: un libro muy pop donde ha calado el lenguaje cinematográfico para presentar la trama. Personajes bien definidos. Un libro entre Yorkshire y la nostalgia del Levante español. Sorprendente y entretenido.
0	hi: i ordered this movie off of amazon 2 months ago because my uncle in lebanon wanted it so i ordered it a month and a half in advance and i still have not gotten it this is horrible.
1	Eliminates rusty bolt freeze up: I started using this on the recommendation of a sports car mechanic (lug nuts). I then started using it on anything that was going to be exposed the the weather. Now things like spark plugs, head bolts, license plate bolts etc. It ALWAYS works, the bolts come off w/o a breaker bar but never comes loose either. I have been using it for about 5 years now and it has never caused any kind of problem, except maybe the silver colored product itself is hard to wipe off of your hands and work clothes. Actually, that is a plus, I know it will stay where I put it, not leak out under heat or pressure. All of my friends now have a tube in their workshop, I see them using it everywhere. It is cheap enough and solves tons of problems...get a tube yourself, you will never regret it.
1	Great shorts: Very comfortable and durable shorts. I bought several pair of these shorts and wear them constantly. I recommend them highly.
0	You can find better: There are better shorts out there - these felt rough, not soft or comfy, and too heavy. The waistband was not smooth and was distinctly uncomfortable with a backpack on.
1	This one is the perfect afternoon read!: The Story Princess by Rebecca Winters~ Harlequin Romance #3090 ~ November1990What a charming love story! I was enchanted from the very first pages when we are introduced to Peter and Michael Wolfe, fans of the Story Princess, and to their cynical father who warns them when they enter a contest to meet her, that she probably doesn't even like children in real life. Domini aka Story Princess isn't at all what Jared expects, but he insists on interpreting her words and actions to fit his picture of who he thinks she is. The boys were delightfully portrayed, and Domini and Jared's undeniable attraction and very human insecurities made their journey to a HEA such a satisfying one. This one is the perfect afternoon read!
1	No Problems: The material was as described and was delivered on schedule. The packaging was less than adequate since the bar broke through one end cap of the shipping tube. Otherwise it would be five stars.
1	Different: Being a person who enjoys the sound of trance but not necessarily a fan of it, I thought I knew what this album was going to sound like but it was not even that of which I thought. Expecting a fast paced and heavy techno sound such as from Paul Oakenfold's Tranceport, the album was very different. Sasha experiments with all sorts of sounds and many different tempos and emulates the sounds of heavy trance as well as slower paced techno beats like you would hear from the Crystal Method or Paul Oakefold's Ibiza. This album dips through the sounds of trance, pop, big beat, and even a slow trip-hop beat in Mr. Tiddles. Airdrawndagger is one of the most diverse albums that I have heard is the trance/dance genre, and no trance or dance fan should be without it. I give it 4 stars.
1	This is quite oddly, yet deservingly, PERFECTION: I have been listening to trance for 4 years now. To be truthful, over the last year, I have started to lose my aggresive stance on trance and its success. It has let me down quite a lot lately.Sasha got me with this one. He starts with a magnificent intro song that completely brings you into the album from the start. He holds the bass that you are craving off for the first 2 songs, and it is well worth the wait.It's all so perfect in the way that he manages his sounds. Bringing you up with any one sound and holding it until you can't take it anymore, and then adding just at the right moment either a kickass breakbeat or another airy keyboard that is completely unique. Sasha is good, once again, in my book. This is definitely one of my favorite trance albums of the past year and a half.
1	Profound: I bought this CD blindly - just because I needed something to listen to, and I am amazed. One word descibes this CD: Profound! It definitely strays away from Sasha's normal groove, and I hope he can keep this up. This is a beautiful CD.
0	DISAPPOINTED!!!!!!!!!!: 've Been looking for this movie for a long time and I really was happy for have gotten it, what happened was that at PLACE THEM IN MY DVD The disappointment was that the film was poorly recorded ES MAS can not be viewed, say no more movies buy ME UBIECE LEAST lIKED THAT before sending THE REVISED UBIECEN!!
1	A classic: This is one of my favorite movies and I was so happy to find it on here for sale. It not only has the dvd but also special features! The movie quality is great for the date of production. Would definitely recommend this movie!
1	Truly a classic!: This movie came out when I was 9 and it's been a fixture it my movie collection ever since. There are so many memorable moments, some filled with sheer hilarity, others that are quite touching. The acting is great, the story is good, and this is by far one of my all time favorite performances from Tom Hanks. In addition to the immortal line "There's no crying in baseball!", there is a large selection of quotable moments from many different characters. I'm not even a big baseball fan, but for some reason I've always loved baseball movies. Perhaps there is an innate fun and big-hearted nature to the sport when you use it as subject matter to frame a story. Films like this and Sandlot, and Field of Dreams, and Rookie of the Year have always had special places in my memory because of the fun and humor they inspired.
1	ONE OF THE BEST MOVIES: This is one of the best movies ever. The cast stands out in this movie about a women's baseball leaue during WW2. Tom Hanks usually gets top billing in this movie, but the top billing should go to Gena Davis and Lori Petty, who play the sisters that the movie is based around.
1	A Must-Read for any Ladakh Traveler: Ladakh is an unbelievable spot, very unique. Although almost 30 years old, this book hasn't lost any of its magic and relevancy. It helped me understand Ladakh and its Buddhism better.
0	I'd like to thank the Academy...: This album features a large English chorus singing traditional Christmas songs. Songs are sung not just in English, but also in French and German. It's certainly well sung, but it's pretty boring to my ears. Most of the songs don't have that much energy, other than the bombastic "Hark! The Herald Angels Sing". But fans of classical music will probably enjoy it more than me.
0	Plastic Taste: We tried everything to get rid of the plastic taste. We ran through plain water, coffee, baking soda, vinegar. All told, we ran through at least 40 cups. It still tastes like plastic -- I'm thinking plastic infused water is not good for us also. My husband is taking it back to Costco this morning
0	The Keurig Special Edition model is NOT recommended!: The Special Edition model is NOT recommended!I recently purchased the Special Edition model as a replacement to my single serve Tassimo. I changed because my favorite Starbucks single serve coffee changed from the Tassimo to the Keurig. Well, after about 2-weeks of using the Keurig, I have found that the Special Edition Keurig is poorly designed. The water container is a joke, even with the larger 60 oz container. It is so oddly shaped that it is difficult to remove and impossible to replace on the unit without spilling some of the water.In addition, it seems like every cup of coffee tastes about the same. This was not the case with my old Tassimo. I have tried a few brands provided in the assortment pack and like the Starbucks coffees. However, all the Starbucks coffees taste the same and even different brand coffees all taste about the same.Very, very disappointed!
0	great product, great service - thanks Kathy: I had an issue with my B50, and Keurig was absolutely great about resolving my problem (thank you Kathy in customer service)!! I didnt realize that my water is very hard and combined with my low use of the machine it naturally caused build up on the sensor. This wouldnt have happened if filtered water was used or the hard tap water didnt sit in the container for several days at a time building up mineral deposits which was my fault for doing, not a product issue. But Keurig (Kathy) was really super about taking care of this for me. I've had a great experience with Keurig and the B50 product, and will say their customer service is fantastic.
0	PERFECT FOR THE RECKLESS CONSUMER: We had this machine at work and made maybe 6 cups a day on a busy day. Within a month the machine broke - Keurig did replace it right away but then the second broke as well (a co worker bought one for his home and had the same problem!!). they gave us an upgrade on the model and this one is still going. The Coffee was good but the tea was not. Most importantly people is IT IS WASTEFUL. WITH LITTLE PLASTIC CUPS FILLING UP THE GARBAGE, AND IN OUR CASE TWO MACHINES IN THE DUMP. COME ON PEOPLE LETS HAVE SOME CONSCIOUS COMSUMERISM AND SLOW DOWN. What ever happened to putting the coffee in a paper filter and pouring hot water over it and letting the fragrance wrap around you. If you are that busy and needy for coffee instantly maybe you should be looking at the job ads or self help books and not over priced hunks of wasteful plastic for greedy americans!
0	Floating pieces of black plastic: After having the Keurig for one year the plastic lip inside where the coffee pod sits completely broke in several different pieces and landed in my coffee cup. Three friends of mine had the same thing happen after having the Keurig for a short time. It seems the heat from the Keurig eventually weakens this piece and makes it brittle enough to break apart.
0	Shrunken version of original is WAY TOO SMALL!: The original, much larger version of this Bible is excellent. However, this printing is way smaller. The text is so small it's barely readable. My 8 year old who is used to the other version started crying and needs a magnifying glass to read the text.Get the original, much larger version if you can.
1	Illustrated Children's Bible: This is a great illustrated children's Bible. My only complaint is that the font is extremely tiny.
0	Shocking Small Unreadable Text - Waste of Money: WASTE OF MONEY!!!!!!!!I had no idea that this book was a pocket edition that is UNREADABLE. I wish I had read through all the reviews before I purchased this item. The book is tiny and the font size is ridiculous.I would return it but would cost me more to return than to just throw it in the bin.Really disappointed with this seller not informing buyers more clearly. Obviously a lot of people have the same opinion as me and would like AMAZON TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT if they can so others aren't ripped off!!!!I have used the larger book for quite a while and it is an excellent book that you can actually read unlike this one.
0	Way too small!: With the price, I naturally assumed this book would be a typical size hard back book however it is just slightly larger than a pocket size. The print is ridiculously small and I have perfect eye sight. Not at all pleased with this purchase.
0	Disappointing: Although the text is wonderful, the print is so small that a child cannot read it. Actually, it's difficult for adults as well. There is a larger book, 'The Children's Illustrated Bible' that is sooo much better. However, on Amazon, I could NOT exchange this book. Buyer beware.
0	Very Small Print for the young eyes: If you are thinking of purchasing this bible, spend the extra money and purchase the larger book. This one is a nice personal size but the print is so small it is hard to read. I bought it for my granddaughter who told me it hurt her eyes to read it.
0	fonts are too small for children to read: My children love the content but I can't let them read the book for too long.Double the size of the font and print it in a larger format would be better.
0	Children's Illustrated Bible: I bought this book for my 8 yearold grandson and did not even give it to him. The book appears to be miniaturized. The print is so tiny that many people would not be able to read it without magnifying glasses! It is not appropriate for children given this tiny print. The pictures are well done and it would have been a perfect gift if the print were not so small.
1	Her best record to date: Davis really shines here. Her first two records were commendable in their artistic integrity, production values and market risks, but this record really nails down what she does well: sings.The arrangements are stellar, and the layers and twists really showcase her composition skills. Her singing is rugged and compelling, and if the lyrical content is any indication, this is clearly her "Sade" record: somebody must have broken her heart and the listeners get to benefit from the raw emotion that shines through from her experiences. She channels all of her previous potential, influences and the freedom that running her own label affords, and comes out with a stellar record.
0	'Natural Foods? Just another mainstream American Cookbook.: With the words 'natural foods' heading the title, I expected to find whole foods, vegetarian dishes, and low fat recipes. I did not. This cook book is exactly like every mainstream American cookbook I have encountered, it is full of meat recipes. Only12 recipes made it into the vegetable section. In addition, there are ingredients called for such as 'canned mushrooms', 'packaged onion soup mix' and 'undiluted cream of mushroom soup'. One sauce recipe for a meat dish, called for a half pound of butter! I am not what I consider to be a health nut, but this book fell far short of my expectations.I could not find a publication date, so I am assuming that this book was written before there was clear health information on eating whole, low fat, foods.
1	Tiffany Ortiz's Review: This was a refreshing book. I thought it was written with great insight. The ending was a change from the typical happy ending. The characters seemed real not fictional. I liked that your evil character Virgil had more than one personality trait. Thank-you for having a conference call on a Saturday morning; that was really gracious of you to do that. Thank-you for writing this wonderful book. I can't wait to read any other books you write!
1	A Look into a complicated man: This book brings you into a thinking mode while entertaining you.A capable man who can make practical reality based decisions whodeclines to take control or make things happen in his personal life. A man who reacts rather than acts, through most of his life. It is also introspective of a man's view on loss. I truly felt this was a thinking feeling person's book. All the more remarkable for a first novel writer. even though an experienced writer. Looking forward to the next book from this writer who shows a brilliant future. Entertaining, emotional, and educational, what a combination!Patt Gronick
1	Waiting for the World to End Review: Waiting for the World to End to me was a very interesting novel. I thought that the book was a lot different from other books I have read in the past. The ending was not what I had expected but it was unique. Waiting for the World to End related to real life situations and controversial issues. The book showed that not everyone is perfect and everyone does make bad decisions in their lives. The book gave me faith and let me know that when life is bad to just hang in there.
0	Review: I had neutral feelings torwards this book. I didn't hate it, but I didnt like it. I thought the book was rather boring and was hard for me to get into. I did like how the story was easy to understand and follow. I do like that about books. I did not like how the book ended. In all the book wasn't bad but it was not my kind of book I would chose to read.
0	IMAGINATION: WHEN I READ A BOOK I DO NOT CHOOSE TO KEEP TRYING TO USE MY IMAGINATION I PREFER THE AUTHOR TO TAKE ME SOMEWHERE AND I DID NOT FEEL MUCH FOR THIS BOOK
0	Waiting for This Book to End: The dialogue in this novel is as stilted and ridiculous as its characters. Here's the premise: a grown man with a successful career in education meets the mother of one of his students and, after a few seconds, he's madly and deeply in love, the dilemma on which the rest of the plot depends. I was expecting the main character to metamorphse into a serial killer but it doesn't happen. This book is not worth anyone's time. It's author obviously thought writing a good book wasn't worth her time and it's definitely not worth yours.
1	Works OK: I personally like this, but it dries too fast. I constantly need to reapply this after a few minutes. The feel of this is pretty nice, and the consistency is a little thick but overall I thought this was pretty good.
1	Very satisfied.: Dvd movie was as promised. Very satisfied. Thank you. Saw this movie ages ago when it came out. Still very good.
1	An excellent tale of the military, good and bad: I first read this book many years ago and have reread it several times since, through my time at West Point, in the infantry and special forces. Now that I am retired I can safely say the characters rnig true, to include the bad ones. I recommend a couple of other books about the military if you are interested: Andy McNabb's SAS books which are #1 bestsellers in England and an excellent view into special operations-- the SAS wasn't that much different than SF. Closer to home I've enjoyed Bob Mayer's Special Forces series-- wish they were all in print-- as I had wished for years they'd resissue this book-- but you can get some here at Amazon.
0	A dissppointment: Our neighbor across the street has a little girl with downs syndrome and my daugther who is 4 has started to notice that she is different from her. I wanted to get her a book that showed someone with downs syndrome doing real things so that I could use it as an example. Unfortuntately the pictures are so far away that you don't really get to see Russ. It would have been better if there were some closer photographs.
1	Easy and useful!: I have these in the corner of my daughters nursery with various little things on them (vase of flowers, framed photos, my first mother's day card) and they are nice and strong. I painted them the color of her accent wall and they really pop. They paint easily and install even easier. A good purchase... would be great in a bathroom to keep little necessities at hand.
0	Problem With These Discs: Is anyone else having issues with these discs? When you first place the discs in the player, it skips over the main menus. Then the "menu" button will only start and stop the episode selected, but it will not return you to the main menu. There is no Spanish or Portuguese dubbed audio on the discs (despite what the menus and packaging claim) and the episodes automatically play with Spanish subtitles even when the subtitles are turned "off." The only way to avoid this is to choose "other" subtitles with the remote. This appears to be an authoring issue, as I am using a two year-old Sony Dream System DVD player and have not had these issues with previous seasons. I'm exchanging my discs immediately, but I have a feeling they might all be bad. Anyone else hear about these issues?
1	A diverse, determined collection: MIXED explores the mixed-race experience and successfully dismantles so many common misconceptions about people of mixed-race or cross-cultural heritage. It's a gem that ought to be featured in high school literature courses not only for its collection of outstanding stories, but for the insights its contributors shed on the realities and paradoxes of the contemporary multiracial experience.
1	Great CD: This CD exceeded my high expectations. Highlights for me are the title track, Monasterio de Sal, Punta Umbria, La Nina de Puerta Oscura (amazing!), and El Vito, but all of the songs are good. I've definitely got to buy some more of his CD's.
1	Very Good, But Not the "Kick" I'm Looking For: There's no doubt that Green Mountain's Dark Magic K-cups make extremely good cups of coffee. It's just that I don't think it packs that much of a punch. The finest espresso K-cup I've tried so far is GM's Espresso Blend. I like my extra dark coffee to have a little bitterness to it. That quality makes me know that it's strong, and Espresso Blend has it. Dark Magic is lacking that "something extra." I think the word "sweet" in the product description is the culprit here. Either way, I'd still recommend these to anybody, but Espresso Blend is the best espresso-like coffee to date.(Note: I have 3 varieties that I've never tried coming in the mail: Black Tiger, Double Black Diamond, and Revv. It's highly possible that one of those could unseat Espresso Blend. Can't wait to find out!)
1	some tropicalia in your pants.....: i must say that if you don't hear the very intense influence of the most brilliant 60's tropicalia band Os Mutantes here, you must be deaf. I give them props for letting themselves be influenced by such an incredible, revolutionary band of Brazilian tropicalia geniuses.....but in the end, wouldn't you just want to listen to the Mutantes???Buy it anyway, this isn't run of the mill by any means. These guys, much like Mr. Kurt Heasley of the Lilys, know the art of intelligent, complicated songcraft in the sway of the fantastic sounds of the 60's with a slight modern twist. And for a time where music was NEW, where guitar had never been heard like that before, what better than to pay homage to such an important time in pop history??? The Wondermints do it right, and you better do it right than do it at all. otherwise you just look ridiculous. purchase, my friends.
0	The Gangster Chronicles: I remember the original NBC tv series, as it started my love affair with gangster films. This movie has taken all of the "guts" from the mini series, leaving it complete flop in all regards. Joe Penny and the rest of the cast deserve better than this butchered mess. I WANT the original at just about any cost. Can someone help me find it. E-mail me at theasburygroup@yahoo.com Thanks.
1	This book may can be life changing: I first was given this book to read over thirty years ago as a very young Christian. I could hardly put it down. I was so struck by the very personal relationship David Wilkerson had with God and how God led and guided him so intimatley. It caused me to seek God's direciton in my own persoanl life and I can honestly say, changed the whole depth of my relationship with God.I work with teens who are incarecerated and I recently had one of them tell me that becasue of reading this book, he now believes there is a God. He was struck at how God led this man so personally. The kids love the book. This book and "Run Baby Run," which is it's counterpart, are a couple of the most popular books that kids check out in my little library I offer them in the detention center.I highly reccomend this book. It is an awesome true story!
0	?????: I thought this was going to be a live performance from KENNY G.instead this was just a recording with a fire place burning not what i was expecting.
0	Major loose end: Two days after I finished this I thought -- hey, wait a minute, she never explained just how the anti-semite group just happened to have a knife with Tara's blood on it to conveniently plant in the teacher's car. They supposedly didn't know who did it so how do they explain having the murder weapon? Did anyone else pick up on that and if so, did she explain it anywhere?
0	What an incredible letdown!!!: At first I was unable to put this book down. The intriguing beginning piqued my interest, and the compelling theme grabbed my attention and forced me to continue to find out what happened. Sloan's style of writing is very skillful and her artistry is outstanding ... therefore, my question is, how come she began a book with such potential and promise and then proceeded to force on her readers such a disappointing ending? It's a shame, because the book had so much potential. Too bad she wasted it on such triviality and shallowness. Her writing style made it very clear that she could have done much better. I only recommend this book if the reader stops after the first half; it's better to make up your own ending than accept the author's.
1	Captivating who-dunnit; keeps you guessing again and again.: Captivating throughout. Though in the end, I wasn't shocked by who did it--I had figured it out almost from the beginning. Good twists and turns. I was made to think twice more than once! The characters were well-developed and "real." This is movie material to me! Hmmm...Jimmy Smits as the Chief of Police? Kyra Sedgewick as our heroine? I recommend the book. Great beach book.
1	A Must for Art Quilters: An absolutely inspirational book for the art quilter who prefers the art quilt to be based on historical blocks. A refreshing approach using patterns that are accurate and directions that are concise.
0	NOT A USB HEADSET: I typed in USB headset in the search box and because this one was the cheapest I purchased it. When it finally arrived I found out it was not a usb headset which was never written on the product description. The sound quality is good and the mic quality was horrible.
0	I didn't know I owned this: I love the "jingle" in this movie (x more days till Halloween, Halloween, Halloween etc) and being born on Halloween, it is even more fun. Now how do I get my movie?????
1	This movie rocks!: Forget about the other Halloween movies...this is by far the creepiest halloween movie I have seen. The scenes are dark and atmospheric...the moody synthesized soundtrack is truly the best I have ever heard (even by today's standards). Yes, the acting and special effects could have been better but if you look at the movie for what it portrays...ancient wichcraft, stonehenge rituals, sacrifices, halloween origins, end of world events, etc...it really deserves a place in your movie collection.
1	Classic Horror!!: First off....I am the biggest fan of Halloween of all time, and I love Halloween III Season of the Witch! It may not have Michael Myers in it, but it still has that John Carpenter innovativness and plot making it a classic. The movie does have its share of blood and gore, but still relies on suspense and carefully planned scares. The cast may be rather low budget, but still manages to pull off a good horror flick. Those who trashed this movie need to open their minds and realize what a classic this is! I highly recommend it!
0	Worst movie ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!: This movie is discraseful! It is is tasteless, boring, and STUPID! The plot is ridicilous, the characters are horrible, and the script is possibly the stupidest piece of s*#t ever written. Tom Atkins might be the worst hero ever! He plays a doctor investigating a patient's murder, and why the murderer lit himself on fire. THe res is to stupid to even bother talking about! Don't see it, or else you'll be those poor little kids having bugs and snakes coming out of your mouth.p.s- it has nothing to do with Micheal Myers. Sorry.
0	Dont Let the Good Reviews Fool You!!!: This Is By Far the worst Horror Movie ive ever watched.I really cant say anyting else about it.It could have been good,but the Director didnt succesfully put the story to film.Its worth watching once,Just so you say youve seen the worst horror movie ever made.
0	Worst movie ever: This is the most horrible excuse for a movie that I have ever witnessed, and I want my two hours that I wasted seeing this back.
1	Cool: H3 is a very different kind of sequel. No Michael Myers. This one has witch craft and all that sci-fi stuff. Above average.
1	Loaded with special features: A pretty underrated movie that would have much more acclaim if not for the "Halloween III" banner above the title. This disc is great for collectors as the special features are top shelf. Two audio commentaries and a half hour retrospective documentary. A solid transfer and good sound. Recommended for those who watch the extras.
0	What?? Are you people crazy!????: first of all it has nothing to do with the famous Michael Myers searching for Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) series, which, sorry people but it is SOOO not played out!! Not too mention it's the dumbest movie I've ever seen, there's really not much of a plot, and the main actor who's made out to be some sorta hottie looks like he got run over by a mack truck!! Also, I had the horrible jingle "eight more days till Halloween...Halloween...Halloween...eight more days till Halloween...SILVER SHAMROCK!" stuck in my head for like two weeks!! TERRIBLE!!
0	possibly worst movie ever: This film is quite possibly the worst movie I've ever seen. Oh, it's true... What a waste of time! No Mike Myers, Jamie Lee or the Doctor? Why even have "Halloween" in the title then? There's absolutely nothing scary here except maybe the acting and cheesy effects. Horrible!!100% USDA Garbage
0	Time to make corrections: Ok, lets get this right out in the open for some of the other reviewers that do not know what they are talking about. John Carpenter, had NOTHING to do with this movie. The only one he ever had anything to do with was the orginal. Which by the way is by far the best of the bunch. I don't really even count the others at all. Well, maybe the second one, it wasn't too bad.As for this movie, I'll be honest I've never even watched it. I guess I'll rent it someday and see what it's all about. At least it doesn't have Michael Myers in it, which is good, cause in my opinion he died after the second movie. I do think they should of changed the name of this though. I mean, every Halloween movie has had a different director, naming this one part III doesn't even make any sense at all.
0	Wow. But wow, is this movie bad.: I really hate this movie. It's so bad I can barely describe it in words. I despise any film that uses children as nothing more than sucker-punching props to inspire sympathy when they're completely undeveloped, like the rest of the characters in this trash.If you really wanna see what's in this movie, go to [...] to see my video review of it. Get ready to laugh.
0	Wasted "Witch": Stupid piece of trash that is the black sheep of the "Halloween" franchise, because, it has nothing to do with the Michael Myers saga.After the death of a toyseller, a doctor and the toyseller's daughter investigate his mysterious death. There snooping leads to the Silver Shamrock mask making company and to it's owner - a warlock bent on destroying the planet by way of his magical melting masks, that children wear on Halloween, turning them into slimy snakes, bugs and venomous insects."Universal Pictures" bought the rights to this turd, along with "Halloween II", hoping to take the franchise into a different "Twilight Zone" style direction, with a new "Halloween" film supposedly coming out every season. Instead the studio put the series right into the toilet. John Carpenter wrote the music and serves as executive producer (with Debra Hill) and Nick Castle ("The Shape" from the original) directs this piece of celluloid waste. Stick with the original.
0	Worst Horror Movie I have Ever seen: where is Michael? Shame On Moustapah Akkad for Naming This Movie Halloween. If You want To See a good movie see halloween1,2,4,5,6, and h2O. Skip this one.
1	Hasn't anyone got it yet!?!: I liked this movie, not because it was a break from the originals but because it was what defined the series. Most people who criticize this movie obviously did not watch it several times over to get the whole point of it! The first 2 movies never truly explained what the curse of Michael Myers was and how it came about! Nor did they emphasize on the history of Samhain like this one did! This movie attempts to explain that and Halloween 6 (Curse Of Micheal Myers) finishes it up! Try to read more into a movie, people, and not be so quick to judge!
1	OUTSTANDING HORROR MOVIE- AN ORIGINAL: This has got to be one of the greatest and underrated horrormovies I have ever seen. They don't make movies like this anymore and they are hard to find. This movie has all the esseintial key components for a great horror movie--1. Mood.2. Plot.3. Atmosphere.This movie is only for the true horror fan and this movie is well acted to a T' by Tom Atkins. GREAT MOVIE FROM THE 80s.
0	bad: i thought this would be ok but i mean not a good title people say bad title but some said it was ok but not only is it bad but bad acting bad special efects and kids were pupkins on there head stupid stupid stupid and the death scenes kids shake there heads and die and a guy trieng to take over the world bad plot
0	The award of worst movie of the century goes to...: This movie was okay. I have it1 star because it lacked in suspense and acting. I am sure people would have liked it better if it never had anything to do with Halloween and it was an independent movie! But no, the stupid writters had to install this horrible peice of junk. The only reason i have this movie is because I want to have all the Halloweens. But I want to actually watch Girlfriends or Ally McBeal while I am watching this. I did not like it. BORING !!!!I advise you carefully, watch Halloween 4 instead.I advice
0	Halloween III - Don't Waste Your Time: I am a fan of the "Haloween" series of films but have never seen part III (due to eveyone I know saying its terrible). After all these years I wanted to give it an objective chance and was excited to actually watch this film. Please note going into this film I knew Michael Myers has nothing to do with it and was just fine with that. Well - This film is terrible by any standard. I would classify this film more as Sci-Fi and what a far-fetched (even by Sci-Fi standards) plot this was. Sloppy story-line that doesn't flow, horrible acting and the movie moves slow without much suspense. The only question you will ask is "how much longer is this movie" after the first1/2 hour.I love the idea behind doing something different with the movie besides Michael Myers but this one misses badly which is probably why it went back to the Michael Myers theme. Too bad.Believe the negitive reviews you have heard and don't waste your time!
0	What witch?: Why did they call it "Season of the Witch?" There's suppose to be a witch in this movie? I really don't like this movie. It has nothing to do with the rest of the series. A factory produces masks with a computer chip installed on them that turns children's heads into snakes and insects. What the heck is the purpose of that! This movie should be on Mystery Science Theatre 3000.
0	Gruesome...: Well, you won't see Michael Myers in this sequel, but it's still watchable.An evil maker somewhere in Northern California provides young children with devilishly made pumpkin masks... need I say more.
0	Halloween 3 is a classic... piece of Garbage!!!!: Halloween 3 is the worst horror flick ever made, I would rather eat Guano while sitting on thumbtacks and drinking bile while watching Leprechaun in Space, than watch this 98 minute slaughter of the prestigous Halloween series. What was John Carpenter smoking when he came up with the worst possible idea in the history of horror films. If you purchase this film then you have just donated your hard earned money to foundation of crappy movies! Remember, Have a Happy Halloween From Silver Shamrock!!!!!
0	Why?... Why?: How they could call this movie "Haloween" I don't know. I understand that was Carpenters Idea, but it was stupid. Micheal Myers is the coolest horror movie killer I can think of, and calling this a sequal to #1, and 2 is an insult to the movies. It wasn't even that scary, and the plot was horrible, even worst than Nightmare on Elm Street, and that is saying something. The only thing I can think of that is good is the director, but he made a terrible mistake with this movie. So I give it a1 star. For that one factor. People may say this movie is okay and stuff. But a horror movie that has nothing to do with it's prequels, that's not scary almost at all, has a horrible plot, and is just plain stupid, is not worth calling what it is. Dont watch this movie. Maybe, maybe rent it just to see why it is such a bad movie, and then you can tell all your friends that you just saw a horrible movie. Well, that's all I have to say.
1	Charles Mann's1491: well-written and fascinating: My first purchase for my Kindle FireKindle Fire, Full Color 7" Multi-touch Display, Wi-Fiwas the perfect choice. Mann's research of indigenous people living in the Americas prior to Columbus' arrival was thorough and his conclusions well-balanced.
1	Good Read: This is an excellent book. Well researched. A little heavy sledding in some places. Author does a fair job of showing where he is speculating and where he is reporting.
1	Good overview of pre-columbian world: I have not kept up with recent research in pre-columbian america, and this book gave alot of good information on what the recent discoveries and controversies are. The information on how advanced and extensive some of the south American cultures were was good. However, I found myself getting a bit impatient with all the details about royal lineages, who killed who, etc. A bit more micro focus than I expected. The information on ecology and the impact of the native cultures on the landscape was very interesting. It seems there should be more interchange between biologists and anthropologists. The issue of what is natural and how humans fit in with the natural world has major implications for our world today.
1	"1491" by Charles C. Mann: Every chapter was a revelation about the demographics of North and South America before Columbus. Most american indian populations were agricultural with substantial population centers with running water and covered sewers, unlike the European cities of that same time period.The scale of the devastation caused by the introduction of European diseases, particularly smallpox, is so immense as to be incomprehensible. The rate of fatality in the European black death episodes was1 in 3, while that for the smallpox plagues in the americas was19 in 20.
1	Over the top: I liked the author's story but I can't believe all the things that he assumes for what was happening in the Americas before1492.
0	Droll and Boring: If you'd like to learn the entire hierarchy of old native american and Latin american cultures than this is the book for you. Dispersed facts about each culture that could be interesting if tied together and actually filled the book make it worth perusing. However, the book is entirely too long and filled with drivel consistent with reading a list of kings for every country in Europe for the last 3,000 years. Information about each king would be written out and spoken as fact, though when the source behind the information is given you begin forming some serious doubts about the authenticity of it all.
0	book was destroyed.: content is great! the company that sent it to me, however, did not mention that the book would come in two parts!! I was horribly dissapointed. I am however, a Social Studies Teacher and I use this book ALL the time in my discussion of Pre-conquest Americas.
1	A must for hard house fans: Well I got this CD for Christmas and I am extremely pleased with it. I think CD1 which is more hard house than trance is the better - mainly for Florian F's Surreal Brazil which is a masterpiece - But still I like the harder feel of this disc. Number 2 is definitely lighter and trancier but gets a bit harder towards the end although it is spoiled at the start by using too many tracks with vocals(I think a definite no-no in trance), but even so there are some gems like Moogwai's Viola. So overall if you like stompier hard house tunes, buy it and listen to CD1. CD 2 has too many cheesy vocals for me, so if you want good trance, wait for the soon-to-be-released Binary Finary album instead.
1	7 episode DVD: Jamie Oliver's original TV show is superb, better than his subsequent ones. The episodes on this DVD (Season1) are: Chef's Night Out, Hen Night, Babysitting, the Band, Birthday Party, Girlfriend, and Christmas Comes Early, with a special feature "pick a dish" (dish by ingredient and method).
1	Tent play: Easy to set up. Big enough for several kids to play in. Does take up a lot of room. Just be careful with the rods when setting it up. We did get a tear. Overall, the kids have fun playing with it. It's a good play tent for several kids and older kids as well.
0	Shine: I bought "Shine" and found that the sound was inaudibly small with maximum volume control. So I complained and got a new copy which turned out to be the same.For this dvd of a story of a mentally unstable genius pianist the sound is the most crucial but it failed.I advise you that you should have checked the quality of sound before you put on this item for sale.
0	Not my kind of movie.: Too slow, not much going on. I couldn't even finish it. There was no character study, no plot that I could see, nothing. I kept waiting for something to happen or for something to mean something or to see if there was any direction in it. Maybe it was just me, but I don't get it.
1	Very nice color: I bought these for my daughter to use before a dance. SHe used 2 towels ( she said they fell apart) but the color was very nice. She is very fair with red hair and I thought the color looked very natural. I will be using these this summer.
0	Tales of Alhambra.: Multiple pages missing ie, blank.Had taken this book on vacation to Spain and was disappointed as I could not completely read few stories The pages were blank.Fist bad experience of a purchase from Amazon.
1	Wonderful!!: I bought this tent for my16 month old for Christmas. We were so excited when it arrived that we put it together early! We bought it for $24 and I think we're definitely getting our money's worth! Very durable, perfect size! He likes to put a chair in it and watch movies!
0	too small!: We bought this toy to replace a tent that was falling apart (that our kids loved and used in the house). This one was way too small. Good for one kid only.
0	Chinese phone: The keyboard, and the default language is chinese. After spending a long time, I was able to find out how to change the language to English. But still it would store "names" in the address book in Chinese language only. They should have warned the customers about this issue. Will try to return the phone !
0	A bit much?: While I appreciate the daunting task of putting all that history into one volume, you'll find this book to be like the old adage more "His story" than history. The writer's personal value system shines through the book as he interprets his view of history. One interesting rant about his major premonition about the Roman Empire and how it was defeated by a child in Bethlehem. Other than a giving us a few vague moral lessons, Van Loon gave us no insight of what Jesus Christ did that was so revolutionary to topple the largest superpower ever. Could you give us a bit of depth? I don't get it.
0	There are no illustrations: I was very disappointed when I realized that this version does not contain the illustrations or maps. I had planned on my fifth grader using this for history.
1	If you're having a hard time letting go, this is for you....: I love this guided meditation! When I fall for someone, I fall in love really hard and I can have a hard time moving on after a breakup, even though logically I know I should and I want to. This CD helps guide you through your feelings so you can release and move on. Every time I have used it I cry really hard, which is weird to me because I wouldn't expect to before the meditation. Releasing the sorrow is a big part of the healing process. I highly recommend it to anyone after a recent breakup or divorce; or anyone that is having a hard time letting go. This will speed the healing process so you can go out and enjoy life!
1	Good Bike Rack: Bought this bike rack and it works perfect. Amazon was running it on a deal so I like that I got it for even cheaper than it was originally posted. My only complaint is that if your bike isn't shaped just so the bike sits a bit funny on the rack. It still works but you have to secure it from a bar that fits into the plate.
1	.A Call for Rationalism in Religion: The patriotic writer and essayist of the American and French Revolutions sets forth his beliefs on the place of religion in society. He affirms the need for rationalism in religion, attacks national religious institutions, and points out inconsistencies and fallacies of the Bible. This was first published in1795 and it is still interesting reading today.
0	Dissapointed in cover and description: Looking at the book's cover and at the now defunct editor's description, there was no indication this book was primarily aimed at - and indeed was written for - Photoshop Elements users. The copy said it was also for Photoshop users but it only covers through version 6 and the introduction says using applications other than Elements for the actions described may not work.I've not used Elements so I have no idea whether the book will be helpful there. It's certainly not helpful for me.I'm a professional using Photoshop CS and thought some of the tips might be worthwhile. I also use PaintShopPro 8. I thought some of this book might be worthwhile for me but I'm nothing but dissapointed.
1	One of the best: This is probably my favorite album of all time. I purchased it about 8 years ago and listen to it regularly. Can't understand a single lyric from it (a few excepted) but it remains one of the best I own. It is soulful, enchanting, exciting, and mysterious all at once.If you are in the mood for something different that will grow on you, try this one. You won't regret it. I promise.For something similar and equally intoxicating, try Antonio Carlos Jobim's "Wave" or "The Composer of Desafinado, Plays". Both fantastic choices.
0	Waste of money, cheating!: this is not a dvd to watch! it is only audio music of brad paisley, with 2 stupid background slides. they are not even real photos, just digitally created. a big cheat if you expect to see somehting of brad paisley...
1	The best book in the series: This was a awesome book, that focused a lot of it's attention on Dairine, Nita's annoying younger sister. Since I myself have an eleven year old brother who irritates me quite a lot (though I'll admit he's not as bad as Dairine) I found myself truly resenting Dairine's character in the other books. But, since this book told a lot of the story from her point of view, I began to dislike her less, and finally in the end I realized I identified with her quite a bit. This book was definitely the best in the series, both in character development and in writing quality. The Lone Power is such a cool foe! Kind of like the dark side of the Force except it's more solid than that. This book would be good for anyone who likes fantasy, and even those who don't might change their minds reading this books like these.
0	Beginning of the end of American leadership in sciences: The sad reality is that year after year fewer American students are going into the fields of science and the best students (and teachers) are increasingly brought in from overseas. Most recently non-citizens in the U.S. have received more Phds in the sciences and engineering than citizens.The fact that (un-)intelligent design is given a sounding board or that idiots like Phd theologians are pining on scientific theory shows how far we've fallen behind. In a generation or two moronic ID theories will vie hand in hand with New Age idiot beliefs while leadership in real science and technology migrates to Europe and Asia.Shame.
0	Please guys, you can't take this seriously: To understand intelligent design you have to understand the political and psychological position that the United States is at. "Intelligent Design" and "Christian Science" are concepts needed to create the Orwellian Society that the US establishment needs to propagate their position as a superpower.Guys, open your eyes, you're being lied to. How come you're the only ones not seeing it?
0	Could be better!: The reader of this story was hard to follow because there was no difference in the voice of each charater. I found this hard to listen to and understand, sorry!
0	Iagogo: As dull as unbuttered toast; the only thing worth mentioning (briefly) is Ewan McGregor's Iago. Young, cheerful, well-spoken and winning, McGregor is the most charming Iago I have encountered in any medium. For awhile, that is very nearly enough. One understands why people like and trust this man; one also understands why no one takes him seriously as lieutenant material. But as the play progresses and Iago's cruelty deepens, McGregor's unvarying amiability seems incongruous. A strange countertextual interpretation emerges, reminiscent of Auden's trickster theory but with a novel twist of its own. In brief, Iago tries to play a harmless joke on Othello, only to see his prank spiral out of control. The poor man is forced to improvise desperately as he struggles to resolve the mess he unwittingly created. Iago as the Boy who Cried Adulteress, a feckless but innocent victim of events: that is indeed a novel take on the play, and it would be fascinating if it weren't ludicrous.
1	Shakespeare "King henry IV Part1 with notes.": Wordcraft: New English to Old English Dictionary and ThesaurusIf you only know Shakespeare by the fact that he existed and was a play writer and you decide that you want to read one of his history plays and the history play that you pick happens to be King Henry IV part one then just reading the text alone will be extremely confusing. Barbara Hodgdon has done an amazing job editing this play and her notes are extremely helpful besides her explication of this play there are historical graphics and historical maps that will help you when reading or seeing the works of Shakespeare. This book is more than a college textbook, it is enjoyable historical reading. Craig Barr.
0	Horrible fragrance: They use the same base fragrance in all of these shower/hand gels and it is nasty. I don't know how other reviewers give it such a high rating. I had to use alchol repeatedly to remove the lingering smell from my hands after trying it. Nothing pleasant about this product. How hard can it be to add a natural lime essence to scent a wash gel? Camille Beckman uses some kind of artifical scents instead. Yuk.
0	ZOOM IN OR OUT: Alvin Lee Zoom album is a non pretentious work, but a truly well done one. Simple, direct, great... From start to end is music at its best, to be joyful, to dance, no matter if the lyrics are sad or happy, it fullfills the quest of making musical sounds!
1	Perfect combination for adults and children: Even though my four year old wasn't ready for the entire movie, she refused to leave until the credits were over because she loved the music so much! I think this is a great soundtrack for both grownups and children- it does allow you to visualize some of the fantastic scenes in the movie with silly songs like "Hot Chocolate", yet the soundtrack also throws in some of the beloved Christmas classics for good measure. All in all, it is a great compilation that should please both children and adults alike.
1	Keurig Green Mountain coffee, Nantucket Blend: A very nice coffee; not overly strong and with nice flavor. The Green Mountain line of coffees are a good choice for the Keurig System.
1	Smooth Cup of Coffee: The Nantucket Blend is one of my favorite k-cup coffees that I've made. It's a medium blend coffee that tastes great with flavored creamer or just regular creamer or milk. I will definitely buy more of this one.
1	Fit my fuel pump canister exactly: The original Bosch fuel pump died in my1991 Saturn after 20 years of service. a Replacement part was $600, for a 20 year old car. No thank YOU! I replaced it with a Walbro pump, bought on Amazon. Let's be honest, dropping the tank and replacing the pump is not a fun thing to do and you don't want to do it again any time soon. In installing the new pump in the old housing it makes no sense not to replace the strainer as well, the old one in my car was yellow, somewhat brittle after doing its job for 20 years. Some fuel pump makers will not warrant the replacement pump unless you replace this part as well- I can understand that as it is not hard to imagine pieces of a disintegrating strainer being sucked up and constricting the pump mechanism. Hey, if you are going to spend money on a pump, and the time to pull it spend the few extra bucks to do it right so that you don't have to do it again soon.
1	Woderful and memorable.: I watched this series when I was ten years old. I was astounded by the cinematography. It might have not been as advanced as today's movies but, it was worth the shot. You certainly will need patience to watch the movie but if you are a lover of the series, you can let your mind roam free. During turbulent times in my life in Nigeria, it provided me with a way of escape. I loved the theme song and I loved Aslan. He was stern with the girl because she needed to know the gravity of her situation.
0	very, very weak: It's amazing how weak this album is. The drum programming is tedious and sounds banal as do the riffs and the production. THis is a truly terrible album probably the worst most uninspiring thing I've ever had the mispleasure of hearing. I was so put off by this album I never gave them a second chance so I don't know if their other albums are any good, I do know that Rosetta Stone's Adrenaline and the Sisters of Mercy's - First and Last and Always are infinitely better examples of this programmed drum gothic rock type schtick.
1	legendary: I don't care how much Elgar you have, this should be in your library. The composer's rendition of his Second is one of the best. It should be considered a standard. You might also be taken with the ancient version of the Cello Concerto. The sad, rugged atmosphere is captured.
0	The worse movie since "The English Patient.": I just got to tell you that I was just bored to tears watching this long and stupid movie. This one doesn't earn the rights for an Academy Award :-(
1	Very good: Who said that this movie was based on historycal facts ?? : So what's all the BS from the over reviewers about a gladitor woould never do this or that ; an emperor blablablablabla...... If you want history go to the library and get a book ! If you want great action, great settings, beautiful pictures and exceptional acting then get this movie !!!!!!!!!! Crowe & Phoenix are great, the story is full of action, suspense, love, etc... Great movie
1	Roma: Ben Hur, Spartacus, even the ever tantilizing Roma...no other film of the Roman Epic class will ever compare to the beauty and splendor that is found in Gladiator. Russell Crowe is one of the few leading men who truely fits the Strong Silent role perfectly, while horribly tradgic, the movie astounds me every time I watch it. You will need to nuke 2 or 3 bags of popcorn prior to the movie, you will be too captivated to get up for food let alone to pause the film.
0	AVOID this BD Release of Gladiator!: The picture is extremely shoddy in this Blu-Ray release! Avoid like the plague, so the studio gets the idea! What the heck is the studio doing releasing this atrocious transfer on BD when the movie itself is such a great one? Unbelievable! A movie like this should have a flawless transfer! Argh!
1	Gladiator: This is by far my favorite movie! Russell Crowe's acting is superb. All parts of this movie are fasinating and entertaining. I would recomend this movie to ANYONE. If you haven't seen it yet, you're missing out! This film has everything important to a good plot and screenplay. Drama drama drama!
0	Upscaled DVD is better!: I don't have to say it, since everyone knows, but just wanted to add my thoughts to this release. Paramount needs to give those of us who purchased this a free trade-in for the re-release that's supposedly coming out that fixes this quality control problem. On cable and satellite, the broadcast version is actually the way it's supposed to look, it's true1080p as opposed to this upscaled DVD-looking mess. I'm sorry for all of us, and very disappointed. :( Get with the program, Paramount!
1	THE BEST MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN!: The Best MOvie I have even seen. Great directing and acting! Has everything you want, action, love, romance! It has it all!
0	GREAt movie BAD blu ray: i love this movie more than love itself. it is one of the most amazing movies ever made period. BUT the quality of this blu ray is garbage. wait until the re-release or just get the DVD ...to bad it looks so awful...great movie
1	An epic like no other: I worked for the most well-known entertainment company in the world, so I'm very familiar with the "formula" used in epics such as "Gladiator." Yet even with the knowledge of how it would follow the peaks and valleys of a pre-determined storyline, it was still an amazing movie. I watched it 3 times in the first week of its release (in the theaters) and I bought several copies of the DVD for family and friends. Watch this movie uninterrupted, without distraction, and on the biggest screen you can access. Among the best movies of all time...
0	Blu-Ray at Best Quality or Bust: Seriously, either make the Blu-Ray copy the best transfer available or don't bother. We already have the DVD version, so it's not a rush to meet a street date. This movie has been around for a while now - the only reason fans are rushing out to buy it on Blu-Ray is because they love the film and they want the best quality version of it - duh!!!! To release a lame transfer of THIS film is inexcusable! I returned my copy on principle alone and will wait for the the correct release (anyone remember Fifth Element).
1	Awesome movie almost amazing picture: Awesome movie, story, acting, etc. The blu ray quality was good, but not blown away 5 stars great. I, too, could see the arrows in the beginning, plus different markings on the packaging so i'm assured it is the remastered version.
1	Stunning, Brilliant, Classic, Masterpiece,etc.: Why is everyone complaining that this movie is not historically accurate?? Who cares, it's a movie, not an encyclopedia. Strong performances by evereyone particularly by Crowe and Phoenix. Even though its155 minutes long, it keeps you interested with amazing battle scenes and well written plot.Everytime I watch it, only one word comes to mind: Stunning.. This is one of the all time greats
0	Barely Palatable: I believe this is one of the top10 over-hyped films in recent years--enough hype to garnish a Best Picture from the self-lauding Acedamy. In all of the two hours of so-called "honor" "courage" and "loyalty," all I seem to get is bad acting, a contrived story, and fast-moving scenes. It reminds me of eating a large vat of buttered popcorn, a big box of jujubees washed down with a 64 oz. soda--fills you up, but no nutrition.
0	Potential unrealized: Knowing that the movie would be (basically) historically inaccurate, I went expecting to like it anyway. However, despite some excellent performances, the movie is too long and doesn't really realize it's potential. My biggest complaint was the very obvious transitions between live action and computer animation - something that shouldn't occur with the techniques available today. Russell Crowe's performance is the saving grace of the movie, but I can't recommend it to anyone interested in historical fact or riveting drama.
0	rubbish: this comes from an action fan, and this aint no action film i was expecting something to keep me excited and on the edge of my seat. no way. there are like 4 fighting scences, and admitedlly these are very good but that does not lift the whole film, the dialogue in between these fight scences is laughable, i went to sleep 4 times in the cinema. now some people might like borin "chat" but i dont if a film is goin be based on the talking it should at least be well written like shawshank redemtion but this is borin i repeat borin borin borin. i know a lot of people will disagree with this but then maybe they werent expecting an action fest like it billed. so if u like boring chatter (a lot of) and a fighting (not much of) then buy this but i personally would not buy it. the end of my rant :)
0	poor recording: Have not been able to watch it as the picture and noise (not movie noise) is so bad. Sorry
0	This Blu ray will NOT work on Australian (region B) players: Hello everyone,Just to bring it to the attention of all region B player owners.The version of this movie that Amazon is selling will not play on region B Blu-ray players.I did do my research on www.bluray.com. There is information there that says it is region free but this information is wrong (at least for this version of the movie anyway).I like this movie by the way, it was my first purchase on DVD.I hope this saves some people from making the same mistake I did.Amazon are not to blame, they resolved my issue in less then1 day. I love shopping for Blu-rays here and this will not discourage me from any future purchases. Just make sure you do your research before you buy.All the best.
0	Wait for it to be done right: I watched and compared the Blu-ray to my DTS DVD. Don't support this kind of crap transfers. I will wait for this to be done right. I gave it two stars only for the audio. The video is really annoying!
1	Maximus!!!: It is a great tale,perhaps historical, i`ll have to go o computer to decipher it!!!!Maximus the great!More words is tooo much folderal!11111
1	2001 Best Picture and10 other Oscars: Simply the best picture of 2000 and perhaps for years. This is an instant classic... Russell Crowe sits with the greats like Kirk Douglas and Charlton Heston. Get this DVD... even better get Ben Hur and Spartacus and have a Roman Marathon.
0	Just Buy the DVD: Don't believe all the five star reviews this release has received, many of those are for the film itself and were entered in before the blu ray was even released.As others have said, the picture on this blu ray is pathetic, DNR and EE everywhere, I'm no A/V fanatic but even I can tell when a blu ray looks like crap, especially this one. If you love the movie just buy the DVD version and watch it up-scaled on your blu ray player, it'll save you some serious money and frustration.
1	Classic: Gladitor is a must have in any movie collection. It is one of the few movies that is comparable to the likes of BRAVEHEART.
0	Quite Sub-Par: I cannot seem to get over the fact that Russel Crowe won an Oscar for this! He swung a sword around for 2 hours, come on! If you want to see the Best Actor of 2000, i'll refer you to Javier Bardem (Before Night Falls). Crowe's character reached no emotional level whatsoever. We saw his wife & kid through 40 seconds of silent flashbacks, tell me why we should sympathize with his grieving?? Well photographed, well choreographed, but the rest--Craptacular.
1	Worth it just for the 7 minute montage of missing scenes: Well worth the money. There are 25 minutes of deleted scenes, but the best part is the 7 minutes set to music of unused footage. You'll see why. I don't want to spoil it for you.
0	Disappointing!!!: Having heard so many wonderful things about this film, I expected a lot. I was quite disappointed - great cast but not great acting. I was bored through most of it and not even Russell Crowe was worth watching. He is most brilliant in ROMPER STOMPER!GLADIATOR certainly does not measure up to the great SPARTACUS!!!
0	Artificial, Contrived, Etc.: This movie was better when it was called "Ben Hur." And I hated "Ben Hur." The effects here were so overdone, the computer-generated scenery so artificial, I felt ill. Computer imagery ought to be used only when necessary, and with a budget like this clunkers,' real scenery would have been easy. The acting was fair, I'll admit, but the script so trite and forced one wonders why the actors even bother. Oh, yeah....money. This movie is all hype. bleckt
0	WAT??......ANOTHER EDITION?????: IT REALLY STINKS!!!FIRST IT WAS SINGLE DISC, THEN THERE WAS A 2 DISC RELEASE AND NOW AN EXTENDED 3-DISC EDITION IS UP FOR PRE-ORDER.CAN SOMEONE AT DREAMWORKS CLARIFY HOW MANY MORE EDITIONS WILL WE HAVE??PUBLISHING HOUSES LIKE DREAMWORKS ARE TOO BUSY CASHING IN ON GREAT MOVIES LIKE GLADIATOR AND ARE JUST NOT BOTHERED ABOUT THE HARD EARNED MONEY PEOPLE SPEND ON BUYING EARLIER VERSIONS OF THE MOVIE.
0	Disappointing: This movie could have been great. Russell Crowe is, despite the not so well written screenplay and mediocre plot, very convincing in his role, in fact he is the only one who makes a pretty good job in this movie - Phoenix was not bad. But that just because Russell Crowe in an excellent actor. The movie fails because it was bad told, and not well directed. You couldn't identify nor share the characters feelings because of the large distance there seemed to be between them and the audience, and that's where the director fails, in the telling of the story.
0	Zero stars - DO NOT BUY Amazon selling you broken/inferior product: I will not rehash all the explanations on the problems with the Gladiator Blu-ray - please read the other reviews for a technical explanation. Suffice it to say there is a "new" version that has been cleaned up and looks gorgeous and there is an "old" version that is junk. The old version was so bad that the studio recognized it and decided it needed to be corrected.But guess what, Amazon insists on clearing out their old stock and selling you the junk version. I ordered this last week and figured there is no way they would be doing this. But guess what, I WAS WRONG.Here's a giveaway - on the cover of the case there is a mail in rebate that expired in JUNE 2010!!!Absolutely pathetic showing by Amazon.
1	A good action flick: Not the deepest movie of all time, but I'm a sucker for movies about Men of Honor perservering against the liers and cheaters of the world. (In my opinion Rob Roy is another, better version of this story.) The action sequences are top-notch and Russell Crowe portrays the quiet strength of a weary veteran quite well. The plot bogs down towards the end, and the final few scenes were a bit too melodramatic for my taste, but that's ok.
0	Poor Video Transfer: This is an absolutely terrible transfer. It is ridden with edge enhancement (halos on contrasting edges) and severe noise reduction (smoothing the image to reduce film grain -- AND detail). This is so severe that film elements such as arrows and spears in the battle at the beginning are not visible. It's barely an upgrade over DVD, and simply not what a movie of this caliber deserves. It is extremely unfortunate that such an outstanding movie has been treated so poorly. Stick with the DVD and don't buy this blu-ray disc.
0	Warning Will Robinson!! A disaster of over the top DNR & EE; What were they Thinking?!: As mentioned by other reviewers the video transfer of the Blu-ray edition of Gladiator has been reduced to VHS quality and suggest anyone hire's & views before buying but recommend all stay well clear (as this is a lemon) - if you absolutely must have it regardless of quality do so at your own risk. I'm sticking with my DVD edition for now. For more detail on specifics of all the issues see the discussion on the AVS Forum & the review at The Digital Bits - looks like we will all have to wait a couple of years until the studio's concerned with this release (Paramount & Universal) do a new edition and remaster the original without all the excessive DNR, EE, and such! Compared to initial reports of Braveheart this Blu-ray release is clearly a disaster. :-(
0	Gladiator [Blu-ray]: If you love this movie, you must import German Blu-ray's Gladiator10th Anniversary Edition! Excellent picture and sound quality and 2 disc set. Region code free for both discs! and more special features!!! I imported Robin Hood Limited Steelbook from UK and it was not good... Second disc was DVD and region 2 and PAL... I couldn't watch it... But German remastered 2 Blu-ray set Gladiator's great! You can watch everything!!! You must check amazon.de now!!!!!
0	Good Movie, but Best Picture of the Year?: This was a good action flick, and all the fights and battles are great. Russel Crowe does a great job and deserves praise. But the movie doesn't flow logically. The reasons Crowe was made a slave aren't clear... he's crying at the death of his family, and a foot appears... next he's a slave. This coming from the man who has fought his way out of so many battles, including death in Germany when the current ruler was overthrown. There are several moments where I wasn't sure why things were happening. That's okay for an action flick, but I expect more from the Academy. Are we ready to throw plot development out the window when the action is good? Man, I hope not! By the way, the recreation of Rome was awesome, another plus for the movie. So why did I give it only two stars? Well, to be honest, in protest over the Academy's nomination... not that the field was all that great this year...
0	Rip-off: Why not issue the extended edition (177 minutes) in a set with the theatrical release? A rip-off, as is so common.
0	A Braveheart wanna-be. Shame on you, Scottmus.: I have been of the opinion that Ridley Scott is an opportunist with no originality. While Braveheart itself fabricates history, it is not without some enthusiastic immitators. Ridley Scott evidently took the Braveheart forumla to heart, and his attempt to clone it is the flick Gladiator.I realize it's a matter of personal taste, but the choice of Crowe as the leading character is a poor one. There's always something filthy and unseemly that comes through Crowe. I can't put my finger on it, but it's a persistent problem with Crowe as far as I am concerned.Now back to Scott. His latest venture, Kingdom of Heaven, again follows the Braveheart formula, and exploits the hatred towards Islam in the West. An opportunist he is.
1	Gladiator stretches the bounds of believability...: The worst of all is the notion that a man who can go single handed against10 or so other gladiators and slice them all down (or to pieces) one after the other in a small arena on the outskirts of the empire - would so calmly allow himself to be re shackled at the end of each performance by a minimum security force belonging to a merchant/slave trader. High Plains Drifter was a much more realistic scenario.
1	5 star movie 5 star DVD: I LOVE this movie. It's powerful, action packed, and well...it just rocks. Great directing by ridley scott (legend, bladerunner, G.I jane, thelma & louise, Alien...), great acting by Russel Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix, and Richard Harris. Great costumes, AWSOME score by Hans Zimmer, (i have the cd). This movie has everything: action, revenge, gore, romance, great CGI... well worth buying.You might have heard some discouraging remarks such as Gladiator not being historically acurate, but it isn't supposed to be. It's FICTION... its BASED on history, yes, but so is Braveheart...which is pretty unacurate, and you don't see people chasing down randal wallace with torches... (braveheart is a great movie too though).Now not only is the movie great, but the two-disk DVD is awsome. over10 deleted scenes, 2 long featurettes, feature length commentary, great interactive menus, and a great addition to anyones DVD collection.
1	Absolutely flawless: A magnificent and wholly believable performance by Russel Crowe. You;d almost want to pick up a gladius and follow him yourself!
0	Shockingly bad: I must have seen some kind of "director's cut" of Gladiator; that's the only way that I can explain the fact that everyone seems to like, or at least to tolerate, this complete waste of film stock.I've rarely seen a movie with a real budget that was more poorly written. Every line made me wince. And the historical inaccuracies are so widespread that it's really not possible to talk in any meaningful sense about this movie being a tale of ancient Rome.You'll probably like it, though -- everyone else seems to.
0	Ugh! I finally gave up!: This book was so awful I couldn't make it past page 60. The plot was boring. The sentences drag on and on endlessly. I kept waiting for something that made sense...I didn't find anything and finally threw the book down and gave up. I will not read anymore of this book or the series!!!!
1	Another Reader looking for Another Adventure: When i first got this book from the library i put it down after 3 pages. At the time it had looked to me like a big, boring book. I brought it home again to give it another chance (like 2 years later) and I think it's great. The story is good, bringing magic into a world you are most familiar w/ and even entering more worlds. The story of13 year old girl mixed with another boy is weaved together of them trying to learn magic. Just novices, they are experimenting w/ Speech that leads them to a lot of trouble. I think Duane had a great idea, and even if it's not as exciting as some other books, it's worth it.
1	Just as good as Harry: So you Want to be a Wizard is about a13 year old girl named Nida and a12 year old boy named Christapher (A.K.A Kit, who are learning how to be wizards. This book is just as good as the Harry Potter books
1	I loved this book!: I read this during vacation, so I had a lot of time. I would ussually take a while to read for me, a ten year old. As I began, I couldn't put it down! I read of the adventures of Kit and Nita as they found, by accident, Fred the white hole; And tryed to get out of a land where there were no humans, only cars and machines with minds. Humans cannot survive in this land! To find out what happened in this great book, read it! (obviously)
1	Diane Duane is BRILLIANT!!!: I waited for MONTHS to find this book, having read Deep Wizardry and High Wizardry first, and it was worth the wait. This is a fantastic book with an excellent plot. It is a bit complicated, and I recommend reading it at least twice to fully understand it. People complain that it's no Harry Potter, and they're right - this ISN'T Harry Potter, it's something more than Harry could be. Not "better", but MORE. Diane Duane has a fantastic talent in describing things, she really shows you everything.I HIGHLY recommend this; it's one of the best books I've ever read (and that's saying something). If you don't like it, it's probably just because such...deep...sci-fi isn't your cup of tea, and that's great. ........
0	Sad to say I didn't like this book... I really wanted to, but I just dont!: I bought this book thinking it was similar to the Harry Potter series (in nature and spirit) but I was very wrong. The characters are acceptable, but the author did a poor job of developing the Kit character... Also the writing is exceedingly dull, the story slogs along at an incredibly SLOW pace...Truthfully I found the story boring... but I read it anyway. I will not be reading the rest of the series.I think the writer's biggest mistake is trying to write the "magic" as if it were scientifically possible, and she spent way too much time trying to do so... Newsflash! Its MAGIC>>> you know fantasy, you don't need to make it or prove it... fantasy is simply a world that doesn't need explaining or proving.I think someone very young might like this book, but I did not. I am moving on to another series that has better writing.
0	bla: I thought that this book was just kind of boring. The part with the white dwarf star that was hicoughing up all sorts of things was the only funny part, and the rest was just wierd and dumb.Contrary to one of the other reveiwers, the book was so much worse than Harry Potter.
0	not so good: this book has a good title, it sounded great when I got it. The only thing is most of the plot is about how they got sucked into another world. It starts ok but then cars are trying to kill them, do cars randomly runing around trying to kill people sound like an important plot? I cant beleave she made a sequel.
0	It's no Harry Potter: If you're looking for something to hold you over until the next book in the Harry Potter series, don't look here. As a writer of fantasy, Diane Duane makes an excellent science fiction author. If you consider sentient marble-sized galaxies, ferocious living helicopters and predatory automobiles the staple for a book about magic and wizardry, then by all means get yourself a copy. Otherwise, check out some of the more traditional fare, like The Magician's Nephew (or the other books in The Chronicles of Narnia series) by C.S. Lewis, or two shining stars by Madeleine L'Engle: A Wrinkle in Time, and Many Waters.
1	And there goes my birthday money....: I love this book. It is a great: a little like Harry Potter only has more of an adult plot a.k.a. more complicated. I feel in love with this book and immediatly bought Deep Wizardry, High Wizardry, and A Wizard Abroad (All contiuations of the series, which gets better as you go). And if you love cats, check out Book of Night With Moon, which fetures Wizarding Cats and all your favorite characters from the other books....
1	Accurate readings: This product appears to be accurate and was fairly easy to install. I would like larger print on the screen as it is hard to read at a glance (the numbers are large enough, but the lettering is small).
0	Deep Wizardry: This book was so boring... It could have been a lot more effective if it was shorter and more to-the-point.
1	Romance and Laughs Abound!: I read this book in one day and enjoyed every minute of it. It has the classic "Beauty and The Beast" theme which happens to be a favorite of mine. Samantha was a spunky heroine who's quick wit and spunk made her the perfect match for her impatient patient. Gabriel was a hero to be adored. Unlike most "wounded" heroes who choose to sulk and mope about - Gabriel's defense was witty sarcasm and a beastly temper. He was a complete ass and I simply adored him!I found myself laughing out loud several times throughout the book and even came close to shedding a tear or two.Highly Recommended!
1	Sweet romance: This was my first read my Teresa Medeiros and it won't be my last. I enjoyed the character development - Gabriel was a great tortured hero. This one had a plot twist that totally surprised me.
1	Dear old Nolan!: Philip Nolan, a man who is sentenced to remain at sea for his entirelife, with the punishment to never hear nor see of the United States again. Hale captures patriotism and heroic efforts in one man as Nolan bravely tries to hide the fact he still loves his country, but shall never see it again. It makes you proud to be an American and live under the glory that our forefathers fought for. So many times have I read this story, and each time I can barely get past parts that bring a tear to my eye. Ultimately a great and powerful book for any reader who enjoys a story of love, agony, and pride.
1	Bragg Books are the Best!: The Braggs have so much solid time-proven info for optimal health!Each one is jam-packed with valuable self-care info, which in my opinion,is the best and only way to go. Between this and my Naturopath, I'm in great shape.No unnecessary drugs and surgeries for me!
1	An Excellent Film Noir, Full of Suprises: "The Proposal" is an intelligent, first-rate undercover police story with a lot of twists and turns that you can never see coming. The Director has a real knack for building tension and suspense... it keeps increasing as the story progresses, and the mystery deepens as it unfolds. Jennifer Esposito really proves that she can play the leading role in a feature... she's radiant, and Nick Moran (from "Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels") plays the nervous, paranoid undercover cop to perfection. Stephen Lang (Tombstone) is awesome as the subtly psychotic Crime lord, and it's nice to see William B. Davis (X-files' Smoking Man) play an FBI agent who DOESN'T smoke! Very clever, unpredictable, good looking film noir. Highly recommended.
1	El Cano...One of the best!!: I became a big fan of El Cano Estremera when he sang for Bobby Valentin. El Cano is a great sonero and one of my all time favorites. This is a nice album from one of the best.
0	Weak, Weak, Weak...: I'm a strong coffee drinker and thought to myself that a French Roast is a bold coffee. Well, I didn't find this to be very "bold" so I can't rate it well according to my taste for coffee.If you like strong coffee like we do - consider these:1. Timothy's Midnight Magic --> BY FAR my favorite!2. Green Mountain Dark Magic3. Emeril's Extra BoldThat being said, some people don't like the strong taste of coffee so take my advice only if you are a strong coffee drinker.
1	Basic FireWire Card: This card was easy to install in my Windows 7 desktop. Didn't need to download/update any driver software. This card comes as low-profile and ships with the standard-size bracket. The sockets for both the 6-pin and 4-pin connections are very close to the edge (at least on the low-profile version, which is what I have on my desktop). I had to realign the card slightly in order to get each cable to fit properly.
0	One Of The WORST Films I have Ever Seen!!!: I cannot believe that there are actually reviewers who actually Liked this film! This Film was a Mammoth FAILURE on ALL LEVELS! The Script was terrible, there was really no story whatsoever and it just didnt make sense! Sean Penn To me is the greatest actor of our generation but this was his WORST PERFORMANCE! Sean's Southern accent was SO BAD that I had to actually turn on the English Subtitles to understand him. This Movie just didnt make sense and was full of holes that were never filled or explained by the movies end(and I CLAPPED when the film FINALLY ENDED)! The Only Good Performances were by James Gandolfini who was very Convincing(made me totally forget Tony Soprano) and patricia clarkson ws Good! Do Not waste Two Hours of your life watching this garbage! Go Buy The Original Version which is a Classic and Far Superior!
1	BOWIE MEETS MOZART??: O.K., so I know these quartet tributes are not everybody's idea of a great "tribute", but I love these things. I have several, and this one stands up with the better ones. Obviously, it makes little or no sense to have CD's dedicated to some of these artists( I mean, Matchbox 20?.........Oh well) The Bowie stands up with the Tommy and the Floyd discs as something I could see myself going out to see. I've always taken some of this music very seriously, and it feels good to hear it presented in this format. Not for everybody, but then what really is?
1	wonderful selection, amazing singer: I first heard this cd in a stretching class at my gym and I had to ask the instructor who was the wonderful singer ! Her voice will put you in relaxed mood, soothe your soul and remind you that life is beautiful after all. I wanted to fall in love all over again. Some of my favorites ( almost the entire selection is pretty good, anyway, with the exception of the last track) : It's crazy, I love you for sentimental reasons and Girl Talk.
0	What CD is this?: I have the original issue CD on the Universal Music label,11-11-1992. This CD has a different issue date, different cover pic, different label,(Polygram) and completely different track layout and missing tracks.(Universal=15 tracks, Polygram=12). The original tracks were:1.It's Crazy 2.How Did He Look 3.Let There Be Love 4.Close Enough For Love 5.The End Of A Love Affair 6.Bewitched, Bothered, And Bewildered 7.I wish You Love 8.You've Changed 9.I Only Have Eyes For You10.A Mark On Your Mind11.I Love You For Sentimental Reasons12.Maybe September13.Do It Again14.More Love15.Les Feuilles Mortes.What in the world is going on here?My CD is a bit beat up,(I've played it so much), and I can't find another copy anywhere. Can anyone help?
1	Joe Pickett? Must be the author himself.: As reviewer Joe Pickett said, this book is well-written and enjoyable. My personal preference is for single state travel books, because they are more exhaustive in their coverage, and thus more useful when traveling. The reason for this review is my amusement at finding an earlier review of this book from 2000 written by Joe Pickett. Joe Pickett is the name of the fictional hero of author C.J. Box's excellent mystery series set in Wyoming, and these books started appearing in 2001, after this review, with the award winning Open Season. I love these books, a perfect blend of mystery and western. So what say you, Mr. Box? Did you write the 2000 review for this book? I also can't help but wonder if C.J. Box is your real name. Perhaps you are a relative of Edgar Box, Gore Vidal's famous pseudonym.
1	A talented, engaging writer and scholar: I loved Lutz's earlier book (American Nervousness), and this one is also a great accomplishment. More than any literary scholar I have read, Lutz is able to use literature to bring great insight to particular social and cultural issues. He also writes well.
0	WHY?!?WHY?!?WHY?!?WHY?!?WHY?!?WHY?!?WHY?!?: WHY?!?WHY?!?WHY?!?WHY?!?WHY?!?WHY?!?WHY?!?WHY?!?................this ranks with the other completely useless,horrible horror sequals-blair witch(they both were horrible though!),an american psycho 2,evil dead 2(it was hysterical though),exorcist 2,american werewolf in paris.....the list goes on(in fact i think ill make1!)this was as spine chilling as killer smirfs.can someone explain this to me?what does it have to do with part one?PLEASE DO NOT BUY,RENT,STEAL,OR BORROW.youd be better off with plan 9 from outer space!
1	A highly informative treatise on Cuban tobacco: Although not an exciting read, this book should greatly interest the die-hard cigar aficionado and the botanist alike; it contains wonderful photographs and information on traditional and newly developed tobacco varieties, diseases, processing and cultivation.
0	They are lying to you!: This made in China not the USA as advertised. Im sending this back to the false advertisers! Do not buy this unless you are ok with supporting china.
0	Not Made in the USA! MADE IN CHINA!: Not Made in the USA! MADE IN CHINA!I just received my order and these are not made in the USA they were made in CHINA... I ordered two each of the following nozzles 573, 573TF, and 593. They are all made in China. I contacted Gilmour and they said that all their nozzles are made in China now. I purchased these as gifts as I have one that everybody loves, but it was made in the USA. I try very hard to do my part and buy American.
0	We'll Always Have Parrots: I agree with Pork Chop T. Boring. No character development and a weird repetition of what would hopefully been a plot. I added a collection on my Kindle called "Rejects".
0	Not as Good as previous: I loved the first book in this series, but this book lacked that same warmth. It is just chock full of totally bizarre characters and not enough of the good characters. I really tried to finish this book, but I just couldn't care enough about what happens to anyone in it.
0	WHY!?: The original was a sexy and track performed by a half decent R&B; group. RL and Next could really hit it off any make people want to dance. It was a good track in 98 and I think would be Next's biggest track.And theres this - a fake ass attempt from some pretty british boys to become an R&B; group. Blues version of this song is nothing but an attempt by the record company to cash in on others material and success.They dont add anything to the song, making it sound almost identical to the original. Even the backing track sounds almost the same as the original.I completely dislike this version of the song and I passionately dislike this group and everything they come out with. And yes, Iam very biased in my opinion here :)Blue - Stick to what you good at - singing at the pub or at the kareoke bars.
1	The Plague of Life: The Plague is an example of great existentialist writing. AT time the novel is slow moving, with very little development. But it is overall pretty decent.
1	A Stunning Acheivement of Existential Genius: This masterful work portrays with elegant simplicity the existential condition of man. Suitable for readers who have never read an existential Camus novel or for experts in metaphysics, this book is a must for any person who has ever wondered about the condition of man. Camus derserved his nobel prize just for this book alone. This novel is the apex of camus' writings in this readers opinion and provides clear insights to every reader. Buy this book!
0	Not an Introductory Text: As an accompaniment to the program MacLogic for an upper level course I can see where this book would have a place. Unfortunately my introduction to it was tutoring for an introductory class. The material is well written and organized but far too densely written, particularly for students who have never had a logic class before and are coming from questionable mathematics backgrounds. That there is no index of symbols just makes navigating the text that much more difficult.On another level, the author seems to eschew a good many things that many other logic courses--at least those I've seen and taken--use in depth. Things like Modus Ponens are barely touched on in favor of "v E" (disjunction elimination). This seems unusual for an introductory textbook in the field, though I am not familiar enough to know for certain.
0	Not worth the money: I purchased this product because I was interested in a cooling fan setup for my 360. The SOLE reason I purchased this particular Cooling stand was because of the Green LED lights on the base of the stand. I just received the unit today and the lights, which I will reiterate are the only reason i bought this particular stand, DO NOT WORK. There was no mention of the lights not working in the description despite it being a used unit. It seems to me the seller left this out. Very unhappy with the fact that they seem to be broken. Product is otherwise cheap and paying double for something that seems to work better might be a better idea. Worst case scenario you could probably set up your own LED lighting and it'd probably look better. I would not recommend this to anyone
0	Boring, tedious, predictable...: I was extremely unhappy with this film. Speed-searching didn't even help. Don't waste your time.
1	watch it!: brilliant... brilliant! one of, if not THE, best movie ever made, by one of, if not THE best director who ever lived. the photography is amazing, and includes tecniques that were never before seen on the big screen - such as filming from the hero/subject's point of view. the sharp cuts and strong colors that are used empathize the intensity of the film, and kubrick is constently mocking the viewers by playing with their feeling concerning the main character - Alex - who is at first the vilain and at the end the innocent, helpless victim used and abused by society. the cinical message that the movie tries to pass on is cristal clear and relevant to the time when it was published. it is also a message very much empathized by the book - which is by the way terrible and written with the skill of my three-year-old brother. kubrick generally critisizes the development of a cold, rottong society that won't possibly survive for long. in conclusion, the movie it the work of a true genius.
1	Shocking, upsetting, powerful.: Let me blunt; I direct hard core full on, bondage and s&m; porn for a living. There is very little that can upset me or get inside my skin and bother me for days and weeks afterwards...but this movie did it. I almost had to turn away while watching and I did have nightmares. I would also find myself staring off into the distance reliving the most disturbing parts in my mind.This is, without a doubt, a masterpiece. I doubt I will ever watch it again but a movie than create such emotion within the viewer deserves a good, honest review.
0	Terrible Movie: I watched it and thought of it as just bad. I am speechless it's just bad please don't watch this movie.
0	Sick! Sick! Sick!: I don't know what you people see in this movie, but it just made me ill! I cannot simpathise this "ultraviolent" man who has been fixed so that he cannot defend himself against the revenge he most certainly deserves! With terrible production design with naked woman/dining tables and that psychadelic apartment. Hardly any of this movie actually looks like the future. Though some may argue that that is not important to the story, I dissagree. At least 2001 looked like the future. And I just don't see the need for all of that nudity and that penis-shaped sculpture. Kubrick is no genius...he's sick!
1	Viddy well!: With all of the mediocre crap such as "Titanic" and "Ever After" polluting the theaters and sending audiences into a frenzy, it's good to watch this classic and discover what actual monumental film-making is all about. God bless Kubrick for creating this ultraviolent masterpiece.
1	This is quite possibly the greatest movie of all time.: I have seen this movie at least 40 times, and it just gets better everytime. Kubrick does an excellent job of adapting Burgess's book to the big screen. Excellent directing and acting make this a must see. It is a bit harsh, but if viewed as a whole, the movie makes a strong point about how far we can go, when trying to rehabilitate the criminal mind. I also recommend reading the book after watching the movie, it has more detail and a different ending.
1	"There Was Me": Great movie! Stanley Kubrick is personaly my favorite director after watching this movie. After I read the book I went out and bought the movie without seeing it. I think that the movie is as good as the book. The only downside to the whole movie is it did not add the additional chapter like in the book. But even the ending to the movie is great! Kubrick really scored big in this movie. Back then to make a movie as hard core as this one was crazy but he did it. This movie is so ahead of it's time. But it's my favorite movie of all time!
1	Made a big impact: It's quite a while since I saw this movie, but it made a big impact on me at the time. I particularly liked Kubrick's use of classical music. I am keen to purchase a VHS copy but it would have to be in the PAL format - suitable for Australia
1	simply a masterpiece: On so many different levels does this movie, based on the novel by Anthony Burgess, excell. Many will take one look at this film and abruptly deem it "disgusting" or "sadistic." But look closer, and you will find an incredible performance on multiple levels. From the cinematography, which makes you feel a as if you are a part of Alex (the lead character), and the soundtrack, which at first boggles your mind with the pieces selected, until your realize that there are none more fitting to accompany the story, to the obvious ideals and statements on society which Burgess realized and Kubric conveyed. In my mind, one of, if not the greatest books of all time transformed into one of, if not the greatest movies of all time. An all around masterpiece. A movie for which 5 stars simply does not do it justice.
1	The best in ultra violence: If you have never seen this movie, PLEASE do. You won't regret it. Even though it was made in1971 it has not lost any of the horror, humor, ultra violence or message. There is nothing dated about this movie, I wonder if Kubrick planned it that way. I far surpasses any movie on this particular subject that has been made since, really. Malcom McDonald should have won an Academy Award for his performance, he was perfectly cast.
0	a very uneven movie: Even though there were occasional brilliances, I kept asking myself why so many people found this movie great. I found the story very incoherent and everything was excessive. It was full of overacting and overdirecting. There are some stories to which movies just can't do justice. I'd rather read the book than watch this movie version. I think people should stop justifying this film only because Kubrik made it.
0	It's COLOMBIAN, not columbian...: How do you expect to get to someone's liking if you do not even know how to spell their name, it is COLOMBIAN, not columbian (unless it is from Columbia, NY) :)...
1	Love that can't be stopped: Susanna Baird enjoyed traveling with her writer grandfather, Robert Debenham, but their trip to Malta was an exception.First her grandfather fakes illness to stay free at the house of the Marquis Ramiro St Vincent, Susanna labeled him a Ogre.Then she found he had a son, Minu(Lorenzo)who was crippled by a badly crushed foot.Susanna found her label for his father wasn't bad enough when she discovered Minu could have the foot fixed, but his father didn't want his child seeing people outside his home.The child had no friends, except two dogs, and a monk.Susanna soon befriends the child, and his lonely heart is captured by her sweet nature.Soon Susanna finds she is falling in love with the ogre and he tells her he wants nothing to do with it her love.Later Ramiro tells Susanna that he is going to marry another woman, a woman he doesn't love, who doesn't love him.Minu over hears this, and runs away.Ramiro comes to his senses at last and they all live happily ever after.
1	Passionate and moving: I am very impressed with this film. I am a Catholic and generally happy with that fact, but I am not stupid and the Catholic church certainly has done terrible wrong back then and even now. I had heard of Martin Luther and was curious to know more about him. What this film gives in incredible. I have never heard even The Pope talk like this. The pure unbridled faith of Luther is moving.The best part of this film is that it is not trying to preach. It doesn't say "Believe this" instead it presents the story without apologies and lets you decide what you think of Luther's views. The Church is portrayed as concerned for Christianity as a whole, but more importantly, overwhelmed with the furtherance of it's own power and crushing influence. I believe this is true even to this day.The world would be a better place if more people like Luther were in it. This will go in "Best of the Best" in my collection.
1	Worth watching: The movie was well done and dramatic. The acting was good, although one could tell it was sectarian.My one main criticism is that the story did not portray the decisive factor in Luther's conversion - Justification by faith alone - sufficiently. This was the lynchpin and pivotal doctrine that separated Luther from the Catholic church and the papacy.
1	Great Movie: Very enjoyable movie that is rather accurate historically on the big points. It showed Luther as a man tormented by his demons as he tried to stay faithful to the Word of God.
0	Luther movie (VHS): As the teacher of a women's Bible class in a Lutheran church, I showed this movieLuther [VHS] after the class had completed six weeks of study on Dr. Martin Luther's life and influence on the Protestant Reformation. I would highly recommend this product because it stays true to historical facts and is not "padded" for today's audiences.
1	Good Movie: This is a good movie and a decent portrayal of Luther. The plot is well done for the volumes of information covered, the acting is adequate, and the costumes are outstanding.Some of the actors' personal beliefs portions of the historical representations and the film is definitely from the perspective of the Lutheran Church. While relatively ballanced, one must still keep the presuppositions of those who created it in mind when viewing the historical material.The producers could have expounded on some additional elements in the time period that were directly related that might have helped a bit more in keeping the bias level less apparent, but the film definitely falls way short of being the 'Protestant Propoganda' some critics have labeled it.While not your Saturday Night Date flic, it is most assuredly a well done film and worth watching.
1	Very accurate: This is a very accurate presentation of Luther and the events that happened. I have read a couple of church history books and this movie is almost verbatem.
1	Teacher: I am teaching some young preachers from out of my church and personally used this book when in Bible college over 35 years ago. It is a great book, very detailed with information that will help any young or older preacher know more about his ministry and how to perform it.
0	It Broke after1 month's use: Worked well at first, then a rubber band broke and I could not fix it, piece of junk!
0	bally ab tightener: piece of junk...a toy compared to 60 second ab machine.broke so quickly, and i am 59 and weigh only116...what a rip off...makes me want to cry for my loss!!!!!!!!!!
1	LOOKS REAL!: I ADORE IT! I HAVE A SIZE 5 RING FINGER AND IT LOOKS GREAT ON. THIS RING CAN FOOL YOU THAT IT COULD BE REAL. THE METAL HAS NOT TARNISHED OR TURNED MY FINGER COLORS AND SO I FEEL IT WAS A GOOD BUY.
1	Bigger Than I Expected: If you are looking for a ring with a dainty stone this isn't the one. This ring has a ROCK. I wasn't expecting the stone to be so big, but now that I have worn it for a little while, and gotten used to it, I love it. It is beautifully made and very shiny. Looks expensive.
1	very detailed account of Nureyev's life: Although verbose and extremely detailed, still enjoyable and a fast read. In just100 pages I feel I've come to know so much about Nureyev's life and the passion that drove him to become the world's most famous ballet dancer.
0	Doesn't work.: Trust me, guys, this doesn't work unless you're a stud. It's all based on making "eye contact", and no girl is gonna be giving you 'eye contact" unless you're an attractive stud. For the average joe, forget it, this just does not happen in real life.
0	PUA Book Order (The System): Small book with somewhat large type, not finished reading it, and not really buying into it yet (maybe too soon to tell).My Amazon purchase included 3-publications (similar ilk). Within a very short time (minutes) of making the online purchase, there was an identity hack against my credit card. Coincidence?I'm reconsidering making future purchases through Amazon.
0	The System: How to get ripped off today!!: The entire contents of this book could fit on one page of paper.The remainder of the book is filled with art and babble. There's even recipes in the back (not kidding).Do not buy this book unless you want to learn first hand how to get ripped off today.
0	Buddha-Lounge: As bland as white bread. It is a misrepresentation to link this series of 3 CDs in any way to the Buddha Bar CDs or the chillout music category in general. It could play in the background without anyone ever raising their head or moving their body. If your thing is New Age music this might be for you. Everyone else is forewarned.
0	Total waste of money!: It is way too hard to get this stuff off after use! If you happen to touch anything but your body, it is on there for good. The bottle itself develops a super greasy feel immediately after the first use. Go with the ID Glide water based lube instead. Millennium costs twice as much, is a total mess, and doesn't feel nearly as good. My GF hates this stuff too so it was a total loss!
0	Returned: Couldn't get enough channels (even with purchase of an external antenna) to make it worth the price.
0	Without their Kabuki face makeup, Kiss would be nowhere.: Kiss is a lame band with their image only covering for their many songs with inane lyrics with their makeup and concerts. They could'nt write a song if their lives depended on it. If you want metal, buy a Metallica CD. If you want moronic disgiuses and Cd titles like "Psycho-Circus" buy KISS.By the way, only the dumbest band in the world would try to get cash by getting Tood MacFarlane to create a series of comic books and action figures!
0	WOW: If everyone actually listens to the words in all the songs they will see that each has a special meaning that deals with real life. Not exactly like the KISS of 20 years ago but things do change. Cd song quality is excellent. Thumbs up guys!!!!!!!!!!!!
0	SOFT AND PREDICTABLE: The attempt to make another Destroyer fell very short. The title track is easily the best song on this album. It was obvious right away that Peter Criss wasn't playing on it....he does't have that kind of talent so why go in and make this album at all? Before it even came out you knew that Peter would be singing a ballad. "I Finally Found My Way" is no "Beth" or "Hard Luck Woman." The rest of it is just too soft. There is no heavy drum sound. It almost like a weak Lick It Up minus the better songs. Get back with Eric and Bruce! Don't worry about makinganother Destroyer. I'll be satisfied with another Revenge.
0	Classic Kiss? Nope!: Disappointing. I haven't listened to this album since I bought it. Yes, I like Kiss, But this album just doesn't do anything for me. They should have recorded another "Destroyer", "Rock And Roll Over", etc, But this is not the case here. Save your money.
1	i give it a solid 4 stars: I think this is a solid kiss album.about 4 of the songs stand out as some of my favorites.i just listened to it after about 4 years the only thing i hate is the sound quality.the highs are tinny and the bass is so flat.but i guess thats cds for ya!i wish this came out on vinyl!
0	Pandering to "new" fans.: I made the mistake of buying this album having not heard any of the songs, and only being a faithful fan of Kiss. Yeah I think that new fans (people that started to listen to Kiss after the reunion) might enjoy this. It has all of the elements of classic Kiss, but it's missing something.Do I think that the prime motivation for this was the money?Yes. Purely for cash. It's nice that the fans had something to go with the tour that was happening at the time, but this album doesn't age very well, mainly because this album wasn't very good in it's conception, and was executed poorly.In retrospect, Kiss has made worse albums. "Unmasked" comes to mind. Peter Criss' solo album was weak, but at least an effort was made. "Animalize" was poor, but Kiss was playing catch-up, and was breaking in a new guitarist too.Some of the tunes are catchy enough, but that wears off quickly. Based on the merit of the somewhat catchy songs, I rated this 2 stars. Other than that, not much here.
0	What a joke!: I was a huge Kiss fan, "was" being the operative word. This album is bad in so many ways. "Within" is the only song worth listening to, and you'll probably enjoy it more if you pretend it's someone other than Kiss. We've heard the truth about Kiss over the last few years. They lie to their fans and take every last cent they can get out of them. The fact that there was no-one else doing what they did in the 70s makes them unique, but not great. After all, every snowflake is unique, but it's still just a snowflake.
1	¡Tengo un alma caribeña!: Even if you've never been to Caribbean, Gloria takes you there with this CD. Perhaps the majority of the songs are on the slower side, but she is "soulful" and it shows. My friend bought this CD, and I borrowed it so much that I got it for myself. The "No me dejes" remix will get you dancing. "Tres Gotas de Agua Bendita" is really fun and lively (with Celia Cruz), while "Por un Beso" is a heartbreaker. Yet even in the slower songs, the background music stays true to the Caribbean, which I appreciated. ¡Dale! You won't regret the purchase.
0	Hummm... Not too much: I found this album a little dissapointing. And the sensation increase in comparation with "mi tierra". The main thing on this is the track selection, wich makes the whole a very downtempo album. Althought there's a couple of up & high beat pieces, the sensation I percive it's like if there were a down for gloria and she wanted to put it in the album. That's no bad. The bad thing comes up when I heard it and I can't get down, Just a little bored. There's no feeling, no emotion, no heart, no music. If you are planning to buy a gloria's CD, don't get this one. Mi tierra would do it best.
0	Always room for improvement: I bought this album after hearing Where The Party At? I still regret it. The only other song I like is Cut Somethin'. All the other songs sound too much alike and the slow jams are a million miles from being creative. All they sing about is breaks up. Do any of their relationships work??????? Basically, I say this album was a waste of money.
1	this cd is tha best: when i first bought this cd the only song i bought it for was "where the party at?" after listening to tha whole thing every song became my favorite. tha ballads kick and the fast songs are indredible its an awesome cd everyone should get it fa sho
1	John M. Keane - Music!: Yes, John M. Keane -- Of the Keane Brothers!!! He and his wife produced this line of videos -- around the time they had their first child. Definitely a fun video set for babies to watch! This is the earliest series, another one was produced by them later is "Baby it's You!" -- My daughter loved them as a toddler!!!
0	The Number is Zero: What a waste of paper and time! There is much talk of how Eisenberg has hit "the sweet spot" with this book -- bah! Humbug! Sweet nothings is more like it. Entertainingly and personably written, it's as informative as a Jerry Seinfeld tv skit about finances. Eisenberg writes extremely well, but it's all much ado about nothing. Read the last two short chapters at the bookstore and put the money you save into your 401K.
1	Every worker should read this book: This is a great book for anyone 20+, who is working and thinking they have it made. As a recent early retiree baby boomer, everything in this book rang true. It's not about the "number", it's about how you spend it and how you need to be prudent in your working years.In addition, the book reads like a novel. I couldn't put it down. Eisenberg's writing is phenomenal. B. Slomka
1	An important read for anyone concerned about retiring: This book is well worth the time to read, the tone is light but the message is very serious. It is an excellent book but to my tastes it could have been edited into a shorter volume.
0	Pointless and depressing: I thought that I was doing ok financically until I read this book. There is little or no financial insight or direction to this book.I really never got the point. It makes you feel that unless you are worth a minimum of10 million dollars you might as well check into the poorhouse. I kept reading hoping to get the point and it was never there!
0	Killer of SSX!!!!!!! :(: Every other SSX game was amazing. This one was very disappointing. I was at a store and I was thrilled to see it on the shelf. I spent (wasted) 40 dollars on this and started playing the second I got home. The music was horrible. The graphics were good. I hated the gameplay.This is baisically the game. There's "The tour" and your trying to get in1st place. You get a better rank every time you beat a challenge. Another thing I dont like about this game is that you make a guy but you cant be any of the classic characters. Well you can unlock them but thats only for 2 player. And whenn you race against them in1 player they are completely different. Like for example You have to race against Nate ( From SSX 3) And instead of being like a normal guy he is like a hick or something.And the point is that if you like the SSX seiries dont get this game.
1	Jared Taylor Has Exposed Left-Wing Racism: If America is ever going to find the truth behind the failed Liberal race-policies, then every American has a moral obligation to read Jared Taylor's "Paved With Good Intentions." Indeed, Mr. Taylor has shown his courage in writing such a book, and he should be applauded for his nobel work. No doubt, there will be those who will claim that Mr. Taylor is a racist. But, the true racists are those who are attacking Mr. Taylor. Mr. Taylor unflinchingly tells the truth about race and crime and how Black racism is proliferating in America. If we are ever going to heal the already damaged race-relations in America, then it is time for us to speak the unspoken truth. God Bless Jared Taylor.
1	More on Marilyn...: The Song Continues is an updated version of Horne's earlier My Life. Much of the text is the same. Even so, we needed an update, didn't we? For having a kind of "take no prisoners" style, Horne is pretty generous with foes as well as friends. (She doesn't re-tell the Sills/Scala incident here.) There are some new pictures, which is wonderful. Even more wonderful, and almost worth the purchase price all on its own, is the bonus CD. There are18 songs on the CD. While they don't come up in chronological order, they are generally arranged earlier to later; you can still get the feeling for how that miraculous instrument evolved. I'm glad I have both books.
0	Love his other books, but...: It pains me to write anything negative about David Mead's work as I highly value and wholeheartedly recommend his other books, in particular "The Ten Minute Guitar Workout", "Basic Guitar Workout", and "Rhythm - A Step by Step Guide to Understanding Rhythm for Guitar". These are all great learning tools that would serve guitarists of almost any level well.But then there's this book. It's not bad, but it's not nearly as concise as his other works. In fact, I read it three times and still felt rather confused. Maybe I'm an idiot, but when it comes to explaining the CAGED system of organizing the fretboard, which is ultimately what this book is about, I learned more in14 pages of Bill Edward's excellent Fretboard Logic series than in reading this book from cover to cover.Buy Mead's other books, especially if you're an intermediate or beginner. But if you want to master the fretboard, get Fretboard Logic. There is no other.
1	April Morning is a MUST READ for all Americans: It may start out boring but inside is the intense in-battle story against the British. This Revolutionary War story is about a young boy named Adam who sees his father and friends murdered on the battle line at Lexington. Together Adam, a crazy old X-British officer and some friends drive the British out (not alone, there was all of the other farmers too, they just stayed in a group). Un-like other revolutionary war storys this one takes place in a two day period with gruesome detials of war. Once you've read the book the movie is a cheap immation but fun none the less.<BR
0	Hieroglyphic maps: The Joy of OrigamiThis book is colorful and seemed promising for a beginner to self teach. The diagrams maybe okay if you already know what they are suppose to look like at each step, but as a teaching aid they compare to teaching American children from a hieroglyphic test. I bought another book on the same subject to help get through the simplest basics, but it was only marginally better. Van Sicklen is not a beginner's writer. This book could easily drive people away from the art through frustration.
1	part1: I believe that this book is preety cheap.When I bought it I was so enthusiastic to learn math, exept for the procrastinations intervening with the main plot, which I consider a very constant, consistent, and reliable flow of information; explaining very deltailed, which formula you need to apply in which situation. Despite the statements which I have claimed about the quality of the book "Cheap", I still believe it passes my test by a mile, and it's explanations are extraordinary, namely for beginners. You can't even start to anticipate how this book altered my math grade. Instead of arbitrarily electing some sequence for the formulae, he invents his own effective process. I recommend this book to all the folks, who have a B,A. So that they can progress and have an A+ :)For the jungens, with C's they would presumably not understand the context.
0	Joe - Oh No!: As a Joe Jackson fan, this comes off as a major dissapointment. Joe pulls off a fairly uninspired striped down live album recorded at NYC's Joes Pub. While it's nice to hear some of the old standards again like "One More Time" and "Hometown", he also does Duke Ellington's "Mood Indigo", which sounds out of place and sung painfully. His version of Steely Dan's "King Of The World" sounds strained. He should have put in "Any Major Dude" which he did so much better at The Bottom Line a few months before this gig. His musicianship is still very good, but you're left asking what's the point of this record? We can only hope that we get more of his quality stuff in "Night & Day II" due this fall.
1	Good: It was a bit more pinkish-red than I had thought (the lava and the liquid) but it's still pretty and enjoyable.
0	Unreliable Quality: I've got one of those and it was so cloudy that I was hardly able to see the lava. Plus the lava didn't move at all after several tries. I was very dissatisfied and returned the item, and got the same thing from directly Target's website. This time it's clear and works fine (though it takes about 2 hours to warm up, but I think it's normal for new lava lamps). So, I'm very happy with my new lava lamp. I don't know the reason, but I guess somehow Lava Lite doesn't have a good quality control on its products. If you're lucky you get a good one but chances are also high that you might get a dysfunctional one. So order it at your own risk.
0	elizabeth and alexandra: This is not the book for people interested in the Romanovs.Its a silly,misleadingbizzare, historical novel.So much misinformation is given,that it shouldnt even be called historical. Dont waste your money,like I did.
1	Read the Fineprint: Overall, this is a good collection of gospel and spiritual music... I would not, however, have called it a soundtrack when , aside from the classic theme song, is music that helped inspire the creation of the show.The standout track, to me, was Amy Grant's contribution.
0	Simplistic: I teach strategic management in the MBA program and do not recommend that this book be used. The cases are very dated and industry restructuring, as well as poor coverage of new technologies (such as the Internet), make this book tedious reading. Miller also fails to include several theories and frameworks (such as Porter's industry analysis) which gives spotty coverage to some areas. The international dimension is also very poor -- the assumption is that international environments are similar to domestic environments and a pursuit of profits (Miller's definition of success) is all that is needed in both for companies. Simplistic!
1	Superb version of a fine Heinlein story: Have Spacesuit, Will Travel is one of the best of Heinlein's so-called juveniles (which I've always believed were some of his best writing) and now it is available is a really excellent audio recording. The Full Cast Audio treatment takes a great story and makes it come alive. Highly recommended!
1	Replacement of a lost book: Having moved twice in eighteen months, it was inevitable that a few things went missing. This book was a replacement and is the same edition I had for years. The condition was as advertised. Delivery was prompt. I am happy to have it on the Heinlein shelf in my library -- I just wish I could get my grandchildren to read Heinlein instead of playing video games!
1	Brilliant..: I recommend this CD to anyone, the Diva's did a brilliant job, Carole King was a welcome guest. Buy it, it is worth it. Buy the video too!
0	Good movie, poor dvd: The movie "The Junky's Christmas" is great clocking in at only 20 mins. It is a must have for any Burroughs fan. Anyone considering purchasing this should be fairly warned that you only get 20 minutes or Burroughsy goodness for your $17.99 (amazon price at time of writing). The other two shorts are not Burroughs related and are horrid. To sum it all up, if you are like me and like filling your entire house with dvds you'll only watch once then by all means buy this. Otherwise don't.
1	This movie was so funny!: I think that anybody that has a sense of humor would really like this movie. My brother rented it and i fell off the couch like 3 times because I was laughing so hard.
1	A TRULY UNDERATED COMEDY!!!!!!!!!!!!!: I have no idea why this movie did as bad as it did. In my opinion it was a truly fun film. It had a great mix of sports gags and situational comedy. Matt Stone And Trey Parker had so much fun doing this. I could not stop laughing at Dian Bachar. He was incredibly funny as Squeak. Don't miss out on this film. Funniest movie of1998.
0	Movie history in the making!: Move over Star Wars and make room for this fabulous and wicked movie, the two outragouse creaters of South Park have done it again and pulled out another comedy great. Only that one was actually funny and successful, and the other is a guarenteed qualifier for the WORST movie ever made in the history and the face of this rock we live on. Watch this movie and you're automatically part of somthing special, the other end of the spectrum of what the movie industry has to offer.
1	hilarious: This movie is hilarious!!!!!!!! I saw it with my friend and we laughed throughout the entire thing.
1	best movie ever: Let me tell you this movie was the funniest thing i havve ever seen buy it, hey it's not like its a great deal of money you'll enjoy everything about it from the cheerleaders to the funky psche outs. get it quick!!
1	leonides: it's not the kind of music u can listen to every day , but his playing is awesome , something to marvel !!
0	A Mess: If you're in the mood for a film arranged around the relentless, overenunciated narration of a surpassingly bland main character, "Watch Out" is the film for you. I beg everyone else looking for the kind of shocks and outrageousness behind this film's advertising campaign not to make the mistake I did -- put on a blindfold and pick out anything by Russ Meyer, Herschell Gordon Lewis or Guy Maddin and count your blessings.
1	good movie: I have tried to watch this movie several times on TV, but always either miss the beginning or have to stop watching it before it's over. I was so glad to find this available in DVD. I was able to watch it in its entirety, without commercials. It's a very good movie. I highly recommend it.
1	catherine bell: i really enjoyed this dvd ,love every thing that catherine bell is in she is such a good actressthis dvd cane very quickly,thankyou so much.norma east.
1	A really good book!: I remember reading this when I was a kid. I always thought it was a pretty neat book. Time travel is always a cool thing to read about, and this one is pretty good too. One of the best things I remember is writing a letter to the author. She wrote me a full-length letter back! For an11-year-old kid, that's quite a thrill. I recommend this book for any children's book library.
0	ok, but not the best.....or newhere near it: i understand where she was coming from and each of the characters problems. i'm only in eighth grade, but i know that this is real life and how people react to different things. however, the characters didn't do anything about their problems. Carson McCullers must have been dumped or something when she wrote this book because it's very depressing. the thing i don't understand is why people would want to read about real life when we already live it. we all know what life is like so what is the point of this book? it took me so long just to read a chapter. i didn't get into it at all. the book just makes you want to commit suicide or something. the only reason i read it was to get a good grade . well, at least i get $10 for getting an A in my stupid english class. u know how they say, "never judge a book by it's cover," well this book is a way more boring than the cover, take my word for it.
1	Best American Literature: The Heart is a Lonely Hunter began as a short under a different title and eventually was completed as this masterpiece of a novel that has earned it's place in the best of American Literature.McCuller's story takes you into the south in another time but what she wrote about then still rings true in the heart of the human soul. Her's is a story of human wants, desires, needs, loss and the true human condition. There are single sentences alone in this book that will take your breath away as McCullers simply puts into words what we can never seem to find the words to express what we feel, what we want. I loved this book and seriously believe everyone should consider reading The Heart is a Lonely Hunter. After discovering McCuller's work through this book I have continued to read other books such as Clock Without Hands and others. She has become among my favorite authors of all time.
1	Loved it.: This book, which reminded me of To Kill a Mockingbird even though the two are completely unrelated, was very good. It's about confused and lonely teenagers, a crazy deaf Greek, and lonely man, and how they meet and react with each other. Tres interessant!
0	Did it really take all these pages to detail......nothing?!?!?!?: Oprah's book club has lost a lot of its credibility with this book.This book just seemed to go on and on and on without anything really happening.It babbled on for something like 360 pages to document the following things: A quasi-homosexual relationship between two mutes; A revolutionary drunk; A snotty, pretentious doctor who babbled on about Karl Marx (*yawn*-- how long is it going to be before people let him go?); A white trash girl who loved music.Save your money (and your time).
1	For those who love to read, the "Lonely Hunters": I always love delving into a well-written, even complex book and getting into the minds of the characters. I was not bored or disappointed at all by this book. It is a book that will appeal to those who feel caught between "irony and faith," or for people who are searching for truth and something to give a lonely life fulfillment.
0	I Tried: I've read so many of Oprah's book selections and for the first time - I am truly disappointed.I am unable to finish the novel. It moves slowly, and I catch myself losing focus while reading. Sure, I get the connection with the characters and the writing is pretty good but it is extremely dull and tedious to read. I feel like I'm back in HS torturing myself to read a book. This is not what reading is supposed to be.After reading these reviews I guess I'll just read the last page to see what happens.Sorry Oprah!
0	Disappointed: I was also disappointed with this book. I heard Oprah talking about how great it was, and I found it a struggle to read. I was easily distracted when reading this book. Overall, a big disappointment
0	I agree - its BORING: I wish I would have read these reviews before I picked up the book at the local booksellers. I kept waiting for something good to happen, but alas... it never got to the level I expected. :(
0	Unremitting Bleakness of Life: I coudn't stop thinking while I was reading this, I couldn't stand more than a hundred pages, that it was a brilliant work for a very sensitive,depressed, lonely, highly intelligenttwenty something writer. Who wasn't made like other folks, and for many artists that's a necessary evil. I havent' read anything else by her, and I don't think I will, I have a feeling life doesn't get better in the works of Carson McCuller and that's too bad.The writing is much better than OK, but,this work is amateurish in structure. There is no impelling story of any kind, just a wearing down, gets to be boring, pastiche of miserable and semi-miserable characters going nowhere except into a future of deepening misery and despair.Yes there are pleanty of folks like that but nothing redeems them here.McCullers is a southern grotesque who lacks the vitality of Flannery O'Connor and the enduring humanity and brilliance of William Faulkner.
1	How to Study Your Bible: This is an excellent book. Very helpful if you are unsure how to study a your Bible or if you have been haphazard in doing so. It has made and will continue to make my time alone with God more inclusive, unforgettable, and even more precious to me. Thank you, Kay Arthur for making this available to us.Nada Davis
1	Maceo is king as the funkdafied jazzman: Live On Planet Groove posesses jazz reminiscent of Maceo's earlier work, yet with a newfound funk element... It's truly dope.
1	famous arias: I purchased this a few years ago and found it extremely useful. Now I cannot find the original and am ordering another copy. I found it practical, useful, correct, the right size, etc. and would recommend it to anyone who is serious about opera.
0	Good concept - Bad Execution: This kid acoustic guitar looks really nice, but when it comes to using it, we had to DUCT TAPE the tuner knobs in order to keep the strings in place. And we had to use A LOT OF DUCT TAPE. The guitar is of no use if the strings won't stay in place and without duct tape, we couldn't get one string to play.Now that it is all duct taped, my 3 year old does enjoy it, but the toy shouldn't have to be duct taped in order to work properly.
0	Product is misrepresented: This item is misrepresented in the description. It comes with a strap that cannot be attached without buying and installing an end pin and it says it comes with a pitch pipe which was not included. The product details are misleading and although the price is good you do not get what you think you are paying for.
1	Strong Material: This is a very strong effort that deserves to be rewarded with higher sales than it has logged so far. Breach is at its best when it is focused on the relationship between people, and fortunately, that's where most of the focus lies. The people on this album seem to occupy the same mythic landscape as those on the early Springsteen albums, where life and death intermingle and all battles are epic. The only real weak spot for me is Murder101, which sounds kind of like an afterthought compared to the fully wrought songs elsewhere. Sleepwalker is, of course, one of the strongest rock singles in some time, but what surprises me is that the sparkling I've Been Delivered has not broken through on radio yet. Witness is another high point. Highly recommended.
1	The opposite of "Ten": Pearl Jam have changed considerably since1991's debut "Ten", and this excellent collection of songs mirror a band clearly more at ease with life than they were in the early 90s. Lead single "Nothing as it Seems" makes up for it's lack of bite with the exploration of soundscapes born in the Mid West, while "Light Years" and "Thin Air" show a subtlety in the band's personality that went previously unexplored. My only gripes are with the absence of a real grabber like "Jeremy" or "Rearviewmirror", and the trowaway nature of "Grievance", but, hell, I'm only nitpicking. Lovely.
0	They've lost it: Pearl Jam died, and this was the nail in the coffin. Gone are the furious beats of Vs, the melodic enchant of Ten, and the pure grunge soul of Vitalogy. All I hear is a weak, tired band that has run out of fuel.
0	a poor job by a great band: i bought this album because i am a big pearl jam fan. when i first listened to it i was suprised how boring it was. i figured i just needed to let it grow on me so i listened to it again a couple of days later. unfortunatley i found that it was still monotonous and the songs tend to run together because they sound so similar. i still think pearl jam is a great band with a lot of talent, but this album doesn't have the energy or creativeness that makes them that way. if you have every other pearl jam album, buy this one to complete your set. if you don't, pick one ot the others.
1	Doing the Evolution: In some respects, I think Yield is a better album, but Binaural still suffices for greatness. Binuaral contains three songs that are not Pearl Jam caliber, though they sound to be at first--God's Dice, Sleight of Hand, and Long Road 2, Parting Ways. Thriteen songs in the album, minus 3, equal10, all of which are songs that could be played over and over again--some may argue for God's Dice--and I'm not say that it is bad either. The strength of the album is its quirkiness, and the band being able to compose songs that have natural sound to them. I think that's been key to their success. Key words that loom in Binaural are quirkiness,as in Rival and Soon Forget, supressed rage, as heard in Greivance, and mind-playing guitars that seem to want to spin into something off of Vs. but instead retain driving composure as in Of the Girl, Insignificance. What can you say? Vedder and the boys just keeping doing it . . .
1	Binaural My view: Binaural is a mix of the new sound of Pearl Jam with the drummer Matt Cameron. It's great to hear Eddie playing different instruments like the ukele. Somehow pj sounds traditional in this age of boy groups and pop music. In1998 they released the album Yield. Songs like In Hiding, and Given To Fly were ballads that showed off the mild rocking side of pj. Now on Binaural, you have songs like Breakerfall and Light Years that have simmilar rocking styles. Nothing as it seems, gives off the a Pink Floyd sounding background guitar by Mcready. Overall after listening to the new album twice it has grown on me!
0	The band that just won't go away: This has to be the most boring album of all time. Right up there with Yield, Riot Act and No Code. I don't know what it's going to take for this band to finally call it quits. They have no talent and their lead singer just mumbles into the microphone -- you can't understand a word he's saying.If you're looking for a fresh sound, you can't go wrong with a band like Creed. They're talented and they have passion for their work -- not like these washed up has-beens. Pearl Jam has no real talent. Warning: this album is horrible. Listen to the song previews and you'll agree with me.
0	A valient effort: Remember the days when Pearl Jam was good? back in good-ol-days with nirvana and other grunge bands.This was a valient effort from a once good band but thats all it was an effort. I hate to break the news to everyone but Pearl Jam is dead, and this cd ceartainly isn't helping bring them back from the dead.Save your memories of pearl jam, when they were good, and save your Money.
0	Santana has done it again... eh... literally!: Yep! Santana comes back yet once more with the SAME formula: lots of big names in the music biz packed in a nice album, with him and his band playing to them. End of formula. Is the album bad? Not by any means, if you isolate it from the rest of his musical production. But if you consider this guy has been putting out significantly more original material in years past, listening to more of this Santana-guitar-sound-accompanying-some-big-name-in-the-music-business is quite dissapointing. Once more, I feel fortunate for having Napster. I wouldn't buy this album, not even for its contagious opening "Hermes". My advice is simple: skip it. I give it two stars for what it's worth production-wise, but nothing else.
0	Don't Treat Your Fans Like Criminals with Copy "Protection" Rootkits/Software: This Santana album has MediaMax copy protection software embedded in the CD. The problem with this CD is that the MediaMax program installs undisclosed--and in some cases, hidden--files on users' Windows computers, potentially exposing music fans to malicious attacks by third parties. The infected CDs also communicated back to the record company about customers' computer use without proper notification.This is unacceptable and it will make me think twice before buying another Santana album. Also, if the record company wishes to treat me like a criminal and take away the right to make a personal copy of music I purchase because of a few bad apples, then it should realize that it will lose its few remaining customers.Santana, please release this CD without these copy protection schemes and I will buy it. Thank you.
0	another sellout: Sorry diehards but Carlos is selling out to the mainstream, what was once beautiful music from this man has turned into the same crap we hear from every other mainstream artist you see on mtv day in and day out....I bought this at a local store cause it was cheap... 9.95... gonna take it out and play frisbee with it tomorrow or give it to the first hip hopper that comes along....Carlos is no longer a Shaman.. just a Shame....
0	Sony Root Kiet: I was going to get this for my dad for X-mass, but sorry Sony not going to get. You lost out on my money because I am not going to give my father a virus. Guess I will get the next CD on his list.
0	I wish I could hear it!: I CAN'T BEIEVE IT - SAME CRAP I FOUND MY "LAST" CHRIS BOTTI - IT DOES NOT PLAY. IT MAY BE OK IN MY CD PLAYER IN MY TRUCKNO RESPONSE FROM WEB HELP; I HAVE THE LATEST VERSION OF WINDOWS MEDIA PLAYER AND DIRECTX SINCE I ONLY HAVE WINDOWS 2000 - MY WORK COMPUTER WHICH I CANNOT UPGRADE, NOT MY PERSONAL COMPUTERLAST DISC I BUY FROM SONY - END OF SUBJECTMAD AS HELLarista is part of sony
0	If you use an iPod and a PC forget this CD!: You cannot transfer music from this CD to iPod if you are using a PC.That alone is enough to turn me off, since that is the only way I listen to music these days. Sorry Santana, I'm not interested enough to even bother although I've been a fan for MANY years. And Sony, well, you confirmed that for this consumer, you just ceased to exist. You installed software on my PC without telling me what it would do, and without informed consent. Your rootkit technology has proven to be very dangerous for consumers, seriously compromising PC security. I currently don't own anything made by Sony, and that is the way it will stay.
0	Rootkit: Because this disc installs a rootkit that slows down your PC and makes your PC easy to hijack by hackers I am not going to order it. Sony and Santana can keep their Copy protected CD!
0	Stuff Rootkill: I broke this piece of junk in half, it did damage to my PC. I dont care about losing the CD. It's the principle!! Release this like a normal CD and I will buy it or I will go to ITunes and download and have freedom with the music. That's after I find a way to get rid of the virus this thing infected my PC with. My computer has since been hacked. Sell me a virus and you can keep it, I will never buy garbage with this kind of software attached again (no matter who the artist)!!
0	All Than He Isn't - Santana Sells Out: I rated this one quite generously. That one star was awarded just to Santana's name because this music almost makes me feel cheated.Santana, in my opinion, is one of the greatest gutarists of all time. Sure, there are the technical masters such as Malmsteen and Vai, but no one has the same feel as Carlos Santana. It's just a shame that he would take all of his talent and throw it away on garbage like this.If you actually like this music, then have fun, jump off a bridge. But if you agree that Santana is better than this, than check out anything else, the earlier the better, and definately go live.Overall, this album makes me wannt to throw up. Santana replaces all the beautiful spanish sound and soulfull chord progressions with pop garbage. Don't buy it.
0	what is this carlos?: What can I say about this album of the great Carlos Santana? Sorry Carlos, but....I will say....ugh!!!!!!!! please.....Come back to play with his band!!
1	Required reading for anyone working with clients!: This is a great book for ALL levels of experience.If you're just starting your career as an account executive this wonderfully outlines many things you can do to instantly improve your client relations. And if you've been working with clients for a long time this will serve as an invaluable reference. You shouldn't just read it once, but over and over again!It's a quick read that can make a huge impact on your career and clients.
1	A Chemical Dependency Must Own: This small under-rated book is THE definitive book on virtually all drugs of abuse. It breaks down each of the drugs by category and by use, giving the properties of each and their derivation, and side effects including potential for addiction. Anyone interested in the chemical abuse field, or merely curious about some of the drugs they may be prescribed, will find this an exceptional buy.
0	THIS IS A TERRIBLE ALBUM: if you're considering buying this album i'd say you'd probably enjoy it, but if you have any respect for yourself and the people around you please forget it and buy something less terrible.
1	The Best Debut CD EVER!: This band is amazing. Like everybody else, the first song I ever heard was Absolutely (story of a girl), and I bought the CD because that song was great. But the rest of the CD is even better. "If I Am," "Sometimes," "Crazy," and all the other songs on the CD are gorgeous. They shouldn't be compared to other five person bands like Matchbox 20 or Vertical Horizon because they blow the hell out of those bands. Nine Days are five truly gifted musicians who deserve to go platinum one million times over. Everyone should by this CD because I guarantee there is not one track on it that will disappoint you. Nine Days is a breath of fresh air in the music world and should not be missed. Buy this CD!
1	Great Debut Album-- Keep 'em coming: I first heard "Story of a Girl" on VH1 and loved it. I bought the CD and was very pleased with the rest also. The whole CD is really well done and well put together. Buy it now.
1	Great C.D.: I love this c.d. Nine Days are absolutely great. They have depth and meaning to all their songs and though some people have said that all the songs sound alike, I disagree. So anway, basically like my title says, it's a great c.d.
0	Biased, but Mirrors U.S. Version: Purchased Book thinking it was the U.S. version of the book, but received the International version ("NOT to be used in the U.S." according to the cover of the book). To date, the book mirrors the U.S. version exactly page for page, question for question. My only comment would be that the book is biased towards a U.S. view. I thought this was quite strange for an "International" management book and the "International" version no less. Some sections and stories appear to speak more negatively about other counties and paints the United States in a more positive light. It was my assumption that a book dealing with International subjects would be more objective and state the factual differences and similarities to managing in other countries and cultural differences.
0	Where is Rod?: Where has Rod Stewart gone? This is so bad that I couldn't even finish listening to the CD. I am such a big Rod Stewart fan, but I think his glory days are over. I have had my fill of his remakes at this point. Don't waste your money on this one.
1	Loved this album: We love this album. SO glad we did not read the negative reviews or we probably would not have bought it. We heard the television promo with some of the song highlights and immediately went to Amazon and pre-ordered it. We take it with us on car trips and love to sing along. It is a peppy and a fun companion for the car. We would have given it 5 stars if it had "Leave Virginia Alone" on it. That was one of his biggest hits and one we also enjoy. If you like the songs on the album, by all means by it and forget about what the negative reviews say about Rod. It is a good album and he doesn't deserve the criticism.
1	Still the Same...Great Rock Classics Of Our Time- Rod Stewart: Rod is always good. I liked this because of the songs. Not a bad one on it. He did good. Good driving music.
0	Rod adds nothing to these classic tunes: As someone else wrote in review, Rod sounds like he's singing to a karaoke track. The backing instrumental tracks in most cases, especially Have You Ever Seen The Rain sound like they were created by turning a tape recorder on and copying directly from the original song. Boring. Also on Day After Day, Rod's drummer uses identical fills at the identical spots Badfinger's drummer's played his. The album is very uninspired. However,it was clever of him to record It's A Heartache because most people compared Bonnie Tyler to Stewart when she released that tune yrs ago. This is the1st Rod album I've bought since Sing It Again Rod and this is not even close to the quality of that release. As most people said, Rod has enough money. If he won't write or perform any new original material anymore, he should think about packing it in. He's had a nice run.
0	Cool Breeze: This Honeywell product is excellent. It works quietly and easily circulates air while providing the desired breeze.I believe the unit will outlive its generous warranty, and would not hesitate to purchase another one if and when it should wear out.
0	Warn the neighbors and stick cotton in your ears: My15 year old 4 speed oscillating fan stopped oscillating, so I decided to get a replacement. Wonder why they call it a "Turbo High Performance Fan"? Ever stood next to a turbo jet on take-off? Well, you get the idea. Even on its lowest setting it is louder than my old fan on its highest setting. On low, I had to blast up the TV volume. I am not returning this item only because it is throwing good money after bad--the cost of returning it. I will use it as a spare, load the old12 gauge and wait for the neighbors to come breaking down the door.
1	Superb Story: I enjoyed this book. There were mysteries inside of mysteries and it was fun to read, all the time, I speculated as to possible outcomes.
1	A book to live by!: In my yoga classes, the instructor would read a passage before we began each practice - something to meditate on. But I only have class 2-3 times a week, so I found the book very easily on Amazon. It was way more inexpensive that I had imagined, so I ordered a 2nd one for a friend. I have only ready through day13 on my new book, but I absolutley LOVE it! I really appreciate how it is broken down into short, but insightful, daily readings. I read a passage in the morning before I am even out of bed now, and have the day to soak it in, then read the same passage again before I go to sleep with a new perspective. I see myself reading this book over & over again for many years - a great book to really live the yoga lifestyle by.
1	Yoga for thinkers: As one who has never attended a Yoga class, I am fascinated by this book because I feel as though I am doing Yoga as I sit and read and think, read and think. Yoga is so much more than being on a mat, although that experience is certainly most central to the discipline. What I am discovering is the meaning of the discipline. I am able to envision the physical movements as I sort out, mentally, the meaning of my imagined activity. Because Gates puts his readers through stages of using their minds, he also expects those readers to repeat those stages over and over. In repeating the exercises, readers bring new thoughts and experiences to the reading activity and each exposure is different from the last one. As such, the book is always new, exciting, provocative, mysterious, riveting.
1	ONE IN A MILLION: Rolf Gates' book is the kind of blessing that only comes around with the regularity of Haley's Comet. By his blending of quotes, personal experience, and yoga instruction, he accomplishes something of serene wonder. His book conveys the very heart of yoga, for it reaches the reader on a level beyond words, phrases, or didactics. Using the book as a daily inspirational guide, the seeker can find and find abundantly.
1	Great Story, but watch the language: Got this book because it was on the Sunshine State Readers list for 3-5 grade. Problem: author uses language that is inappropriate for this age group. Several uses of the word "bu**" another "fa**" and several "b**b", which I find inappropriate for 8 -10 year old kids. My local public elementary school won't even stock the book. Why would Mr. Fogelin do this to an otherwise great kids book?
1	Just like Nancy Drew: Great story for a quick read by the same author who wrote many of the Nancy Drew books.The entire Penny Parker series is dated in the1940's, but cutesy and interesting.
0	No Rubber Seal: I figured that a gas cap like this would ship with a rubber seal on the inside. It does not. Had to makeshift a rubber seal. Really a big bummer.
1	dry floors: We love the Water Boy water dish.No longer constantly mopping up after our dog drinks. We have given one to our daughter for her dog and she loves it.We are buying more for other family dogs and want a spare for us when the summer comes,heard you can fill half way and freeze so it's ready for a hot day or just a hike through the park.
0	Travel water bowl best suited to smaller breeds: I gave this a two star rating based on the fact that mine was to be used for a larger dog. This product would be adequate for a small dog. But the opening for a dog with a larger muzzle is not large enough. The claims for not spilling water seem to be true. However, since only about an inch of water is in the bottom of the opening at any time, it's more difficult for a larger dog to get his nose in and get a good drink. I guess if the dog were extremely thirsty and had no other water supply, this could do in a pinch.
1	Nice.: Great to have a large capacity water container that is made to minimize spills. Good for travel and kennel recommend to all who travel.
1	Great travel water bowl: I am happy with this product and they are spill proof as stated. I would love to see a cover to make this product leak proof too! If you lay the travel water bowl flat they do not spill, however they do spill if you place them in an upright position. I place these in the freezer and then take these to the fields to water the dogs while we are planting.My chocolate lab has no problem drinking from this product.
1	Incredible!: The name of this book is what caught my eye, but, as soon as I opened it, I realized how great it is. I learned of quite a few mistakes I make, and often WHY. The author's somewhat ranting tone makes an otherwise dense and boring subject a bit more approachable. I highly recommend this book.
1	Novice user, but good enough to see a good stick.: I just received this stick today. I'm anxious to take it home and try it out. I can say it is smooth, straight, and glides through my fingers with ease. The weight is perfect for what I am looking for, and it feels like a perfect fit. If this stick performs as well as it looks and feels, I may have just found the sticks to fill my rack.As far as the shipping goes, it was delayed at first, but when they did ship it, it literally got here the next day. I have absolutely no complaints about the shipper. If it fails to meet my expectations, I will update this on an "As Needed Basis".
1	Great book to learn banjo!!: I bought it as an extra book and have used the same book for years (mine was deteriorating) and have shown it to many friends to use when they express an interest in learning to play the banjo. It is a great book. I love it.
0	Retraction! Company fixed CD Works Great now!: The company fixed the CD and sounds great now! Great company to work with. Very responsive. Would definitely buy from them again!Would definitely give them 5 stars but Amazons review editing system won't let me change my rating!
1	Worked like a charm!: Wasn't sure what was wrong with my ice maker, so I bought this kit. Replaced just the main ice maker component (took less than10 minutes), and the unit started right up. It has been making ice reliably. Great deal.
0	GE=No Good: GE neglects to inform you that you need a special1/4 inch saddle valve! It cost me150.00 for a diagnosis with out putting it on. If your cubes are hollow or slushie this is the problem. I contacted GE with 502-452-4205 they dismiss the problem and cost. I will never buy GE again!
0	A HUGE Disappointment: I have to admit this CD is my most major disappoint so far this year. There just doesn't seem to be much energy left in GVSB. I've always suspected that Scott McCloud was the real talent behind this group, and he's the only one who still sounds like he's holding up, the rest of them just fizzle. This impression was reinforced when I saw them peform at the Mercury Lounge on a trip to New York a few weeks ago. McCloud came through (barely), but the others acted half dead. Johnny Temple in particular seemed out of it. I was pretty close to the stage and he looked sort of tired and stressed, so maybe he was having an off night. I hope so. Otherwise it looks like this is going to be GVSB's last hurrah.
1	Guitar: Great guitar to buy if you want to save some money on a beginner guitar. Acoustics are always a good first guitar it helps you develop fundamentals. And it sounds great for the price.
1	Penguin: The real pictures in this book are great! It describes the life cycle of a penguin in easy-to-understand words.
1	Los Mocosos does it again!!!!!!!!!!!: Los Mocosos is a very unique band with strong latin roots from the Mission Dist. If you are a fan of Santana, Malo, War, Tower of Power this is a must CD for you to have in your collection. I have all Los Mocosos cd's and they are all great. This one includes an eclectic mix and a beautiful remake of "I'm your puppet". It is better than the original. These guys will go far and I hope they stay together for a long time to come. It is not very often that I like a whole CD but I like every song on this Cd. This is a cd that you must get. Check out their other cd Shades of Brown also a great cd. Peace Light Love Joy and enjoy this Los Mocosos cd. Ike
0	Waste of money and dangerous Steroids too: This stuff was a waste of money. It contains Androst chemicals which are steroids. There are safer products on the market too. I tried Instinto Sensual. It is safe and works great too.
1	hooks the brillant: this is a throuogh explanation on the state of the African American. it is a worthwhile book for anyone intersted in African Amrican people. it is a brillant book writtn by a brillant writer. it worth buying and reading it.
0	Poor Sound Quality for the price: Compared to Shure's E2cs, the rival they're going for, it just doesn't match up. For almost the same price, they offer a higher noise isolation, i've compared them in outdoor environments.
0	Creative Zen Aurvana In-Ear Headphones: They make it sould like these are active noise canceling headphones. They are also priced like they are. However, they are just over-prices bud headphones.
0	Comfortable but ...: These are very comfortable, small and light, and they block the ambient noise very well. There are a couple of major problems however. One is that the chord is microphonic. It transmits a loud scraping sound to the earpieces when it rubs on your face or clothing. The other is the response. The only other earphones I have to compare it against are the Ultimate Ears Super.fi 3, (a.k.a. Altec Lansing UHP336). The Zen suffers very badly by comparison. It has an uneven frequency response with a bump in the mid treble range around 3kHz to 5kHz that makes it sound shouty. Another nit is that there is no room in the supplied carrying case for the airplane connection adapter.
0	Wrong item received: I ordered the hardcover book pictured at a price of $66. I received a paperback with a cover price of 95 cents! Waiting to hear from the seller.
1	ceramabryte scraper: This tool is small for nice storage and use. The razor or sharp edge works perfect on my flat top stove for scraping off burnt on stuff before I use the rest of ceramabryte prodects to clean it. The razor appears to be replaceable.
0	Not Worth the Money - Skip It!: This book is a waste of money. It contains dated information and it is not well organized. You could find better data on Google.I was looking for a list of addresses for softball and volleyball players and there is no place in the book to find names that are grouped by sport.Save your money - take a few minutes and look up the information yourself. A real mess!
0	The book was mostly just boring.: A few of the chapters were interesting. I liked the ones about slave revolts, but the rest were about people talking about war, the sugar interest, or other VERY boring things. I had to read this book for school and was supposed to take notes, but the book was so boring that I couldn't find the main idea of many chapters. The most interesting characters in the book didn't even exist and the historical ones were hardly even mentioned. For a historically acurate book, Caribbean is hardly acurate and I would not read this one just for fun.
0	Hypocrite Lecteur!: Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, submitted for your consideration: "The Predators," by Mark Washburn and Robert Webb (Stein and Day,1984). From the jacket blurb:"The fiercest creature in the sea is the Great White Shark. The fiercest creature on land is the Kodiak Brown Bear. What happens when they are doomed by human predators to fight each other in the fiercest specatator sport ever imagined?Can human perversity encompass a combat between a twenty-foot Great White and a two-thousand-pound Kodiak for the sake of entertainment? Big-time promoter Augie Zisk is certain it can, and when the scheme is first brought to him he says only one word: cable. Ten million people will pay to watch an exhibition on television, and General Hidalgo de Carazonzo will be happy to host the show in his banana republic."A neglected, and now hideously cannibalized, masterpiece.For shame, Mr. Bachelder. J'accuse!
0	Not funny. No real plot. Poor satire. Not well written: I was greatly disappointed with Bear V. Shark. I expected something funny. It is not. I expected satire and political humor, it has none. If the author was trying for a book like, "1984" or "Brave New World" or "Fahrenheit 451" or "Animal Farm" or "The Jungle" he missed by a huge margin. Truly good satire tells a story, and makes a message. BearV. Shark does neither.The book is so inconsistent and difficult to follow that it becomes almost unreadable. It reminded me of the ramblings of a psychiatric patient (was that the author's intent?) I did finish the book hoping it would wind up in a glorious manner, but it just plods along and ends.None of the characters are in any way believable. None of the situations are engaging. None of the attempts at humor are funny. I was really, really disappointed. Did the other reviewers actually read this book?
0	A lot of syrup: This DVD has a few really enjoyeable songs. It is one of those videos that seeing it one time is enough. There are some good history points and traveling interest Daniel explains and good scenery of Ireland which make the video palatable. Too much video footage is of Daniel himself. I would recommed buying this DVD if you can get it for a low price.
0	Works for 6 weeks: This unit broke, simply stopped working after six weeks since opening the box. The unit was used nearly every day 5 days a week in an industrial, workbench environment. I believe the units works well when functional. Perhaps it is most suited for hobbyists.Edit: Amazon replaced our unit with a duplicate model without labels or brand stickers. It still works today.
0	Do not buy: I had this gun about 6 months before it just quit working. Save your money and buy something else.
0	Not worth it.: I purchased this in February 2012. It died in late July 2012. In that span of time I had used the gun perhaps 7-8 times for a total of no more than 2-3 hours of cumulative use. Then last Saturday the gun just died. I happened to notice a bit of sparking though the vents in the lower housing and then that was all they wrote for the heat gun.It does have a 2 year warranty, but for what it would cost me in shipping I would rather put that money towards another to replace it. Which is what I plan to do.Judging from other reviews on this heat gun it's pretty much hit and miss. You might get a good one or like a bad one. My suggestion? Look for a product that has far more hits than misses.
0	Nice toy, poor training device: The hardware itself is well-built. The display is high-contrast and easy to read, and the buttons have a good feel and are laid out rationally. The problem is with the software.The biggest problem is the fact that this device has the dealer stand on16 (hard or soft), not17, making the device useless for practicing Basic Strategy. There are a few other quirks with the software. A player's three or more card 21 wins instantly--no push against a dealer's 21. Also, the dealer doesn't expose his natural, allowing you to double-down or split against it and lose twice (but also allows you to surrender against it). You are only allowed to double-down on a10 or ace, a rule seldom found in shoe games. An ace-9 combination shows up as "10", not "20", but settles the bet correctly if you stand. And due to screen size limitation, you must stand on any six card hand; fortunately, so must the dealer.All in all, a nice toy, but not a serious blackjack trainer.
0	Not a top quality blackjack toy for the money: The blackjack game does not exhibit odds. You can't double-down on multiple hands (Las Vegas permits you doing this). The hit button is overly sensitive--two cards are dealt instead of one. I question about the true randomness of the cards dealt.
0	XR41s and Tri-whammers: Okay so I made those words up. They're not actual military terms. Buried in this Tom Clancy book though, I doubt that anyone except submarine and naval experts would even notice. I've never heard of an author doing TOO much research for a book. I think Clancy lost touch with the everyday reader if he thinks anyone would understand enough of the jargon he spews here to care about this book. And when jargon is all a book offers (characters? what characters?) the book, to put in simple, non-Clancian terms, SUCKS! Clearly it's not the dumbest book I've ever read, but it is the worst. I make it a mission never to stop a book once I've started, and never to refuse reading a book given to me. This book made me question the value of such a mission. Too boring, too long, too technical, too empty.
0	A good idea made into a bad novel: This novel is very long and boring.When Clancy describes the submarine battles,the text results heavy and very difficult to follow.In fact,the novel contains too many technical details about the weapons.The book would be better if it contained more references about the persons.And I have to say that I think that this novel has a excess of 400 pages.(The Spanish edition of Plaza y Janes has almost1000 pages in small format)
1	Greatest contemporary war story ever written: I read this book while stationed in Germany in the late eighties and its still one of the greatest reads I've ever had....The story is so believable, especially if you've been to the cities he writes about, as well as having trained for such a scenario...great book
0	Severe Printing Errors: I have not yet read the entire book, though I do quite enjoy what I have read, this edition of the novel suffers from some very severe printing errors. Namely, the first 3 chapters or so are out of sync with the rest of the book. The first page of the book is page16, and there seems to be fragments of a forward and an author's note printed throughout this section. The rest of the book appears okay, though.
0	crap: This was pretty crap none of the kids like them and they are not amazing at all. My kids threw them in the trash first day, just a waste of money
0	its a rip off.: There is only ONE page of useful info in the entire book. I am not kidding! ONE page. Everything else is fluff to sell a book. I thought it might be fun to read in bed w/ my girlfriend...negative.the one page has a fairly accurate diagram of the vagina w/ some arrows that say "rub here."Everything else was crap.And a waste of time.I guess if you are a terrible lover who doesn't try and please your woman - it could be marginally useful but not in comparison to most texts out there.If you know it's important to get your girl turned on before going to work than all you need out of this book is that one page. Look it up on the net and save your money.
0	Not A Toy: It's actually a very poorly made and easily damaged costume. The purple color comes off in a strong breeze. Therefore it is very overpriced. Mine arrived with the fabric pre-ruined, but I don't have time or funds to make/buy another costume. You are much better off just buying a wig and putting the rest of the costume together yourself.
1	Zumo 550: The Zumo works great. It's well built, water proof and easy to use. I was able to down load a route like I wanted and it followed it to a tee (you have to set it to "Off Road" mode). The fuel gage is nice to have it gives you a heads up before the low fuel light comes on. I wish it would show the speed limit like my Nuvi does. I would recommend it and I would buy another one.
1	Great for Motorcycle: If you ride a bike you need one of these. The only complaint I have is with the bluetooth. It has two channels of bluthooth but has a very limited amount of phones that it will work with. Most of them are very old model. If you hook up a phone not on the list it will pair up but if you also pair up a headset then it goes crazy. Once I found an old phone (Motorla RAZR) it works great.
1	Takes a licking and ...: I take the unit off the bike every time I stop(I don't trust the locking screw).One time I did not fully secure the GPS into the cradle.While going down the road at 50+ miles per hour it flew off.I thought great there's $600 down the drain.I circled back and picked up the device.It was banged up in a few places (the corners were completely scuffed).I turned it on and it WORKED!I have fully tested it and everything works (it's now15+ days since the incident).All-in-all a good GPS for those of us who are a little rough on our hardware.
0	Broke down in 3 weeks: Product just quit working 3 weeks after I got it. Sent it back to manufacturer (Garmin) who said they would have it fixed on a priority and over-nighted back to me. That was almost two weeks ago and have not gotten it back yet. Still waiting.
1	Great GPS: Even though the price is more than what I wanted to pay, it was worth it. I like the choices of voices and ease of use. Like all GPSs, you have to get use to inaccuracies during your trip. It's good to study your route before heading out. Sometimes common sence is better than the GPS itself. Battery life is good. Just wish it would work with my current cell phone (EnV).
1	Love it: Though the price is something you have to consider most, I love the vest, style, quality and even the color. My son got the blue one and he loves it from the beginning. It's very soft, comfortable and stylist that helps him floating very well, of course with the help of his father to make his head up. It doesn't take long for a 2-year-old boy to get used to it too. Not like the fabric vest, this one doesn't stick to his skin and it dries out very quick. We had a very good time in the pools and had a hard time to pull him out of the water. Absolutely a good purchase, it deserves every penny.
1	So cute!: This hat is honestly one of the very cutest things I have bought for my daughter thus far. Everyone comments on it wherever we go and thankfully, there is plenty more room for her to grow into it!It's been machine washed and dryed several times with no problems. No fading, fraying, shrinking, or pilling.Super cute!
0	the big town (vhs): My Husband wanted the movie on dvd but all I could find was vhs so I ordered it for him he loved it the first time he watched it but the second time he tried to watch it it wouldn't work . It would not trac.
1	An interesting lady: This was a good book. It was a bit long, in that the whole book is based off of one day. It was interesting, in that I wanted to see what would happen to Miss Pettigrew, overall a good book, glad I got to read it.
0	Not the Sims 2: I do not like this game at all. The graphics are awful. I even like the first Sims for the Playstation than this one. I feel I was ripped off paying $50.00 for this farce. I have the Sims 2 for the PC and all the expansion packs and I love that game. I feel like I'm getting somewhere on that one. You can't shut the aging off so don't know if on this game they age or not. Don't know if the they even have kids and if they age or not. Also they work 7 days a week just like in the first one. I don't recommend anyone buying this one. I wouldn't buy any of the other ones they have either because if they are anything like this one it's just a rip off.When I went to make people I didn't get many choices on anything and the people looked and walked just like they did on the first one. They should never have called this one Sims 2 because it sure isn't.
1	From jazz to eternity: Starting with some hot but slightly populist swing, then turning to schmultzy (this word doesn't exist, but I think you get my drift) pop evergreen and then covering the field from top class jazz and blues to country... Dinah really shines at this CD, trust me on that one or listen yourself.A jazz fan like myself could wish for a jazzier selection, but then again, jazz fans probably already have some of her fienst jazz work (tributes to Bessie Smith, jamming with Clark Terry, Maynard Ferguson, Clifford Brown, Hank Jones, Terry Gibbs, Buck Clayton and others; swinging hard with Lionel Hampton or Red Norvo...).This is a perfect introduction to Dinah Washington's entire career and her vastly diverse opus.Hopefully, it will lead some to explore her jazz legacy (not as consistently excellent as Sarah Vaughan's jazz-opus, but equally great and powerful when she hits it right with her mighty voice).
1	Gimme a piece of BEEFCAKE!!: Beefcake is a documentary and a gem of a movie all rolled into one. Its focal point is the physique magazines of the 40's and 50's. The director shows the steamier and more homoerotic side (as if it needed more of one) of these magazines. It also covers how they came to be and why they dissappeared off of magazine shelves. Before watching the movie i knew very little about it except that it was gay themed and discussed muscle boys. Even though i really couldnt care less for muscle boys, i still watched the movie and i am glad i did.. It's colors are very visually stimulating and the images are great.. The documentary moments are amusing and the film moments are even funnier. I would reccomend this movie to anyone who wants to laugh and just enjoy a good movie.
1	Stamina Electronic Mini-Stepper: The stepper is tough to use at first but that's probably because I'm out of shape. I've used it several times but not on a regular basis. The only probably I have is that it's hard to maintain your balance at times. Otherwise, it's a great little exercise medium for the price and I like it because it's small enough to put away anywhere.
1	A Great must have book: This thing really works. I tried the exercises and noticed HUGE improvement in my memory and the ability to visualize things in a way I had never dreamed before.
1	Best Book!: This is the best book in the field of creativity and accelerated learning!!! After only15 minutes, I felt that my brain had a really good and hard workout.
0	Can You Say - Stuffing The Ballot Box?!?: At the time of this writing, when I click on 'See all 91 reviews' ALL OF THE 5 STAR REVIEWS on the page (reviews1-10) are written by a reviewer who has reviewed ONLY THIS BOOK! Since 7 of these10 reviews ARE 5 star reviews I either have to conclude that this book is the most sensational book of the century and inspires people who have never written another review ever to sign up on Amazon to do just that for this book OR the ballot box is being stuffed here. Read the more measured reviews and the astute reader will be able to easily discern which of these two possibilities is true...I, personally, don't like it when the seller himself or reviewers associated with the seller do not identify themselves as such when reviewing a product!
0	Pseudociencia: Este libro y el sitio mantenido por Win Wenger son un claro ejemplo de la pseudociencia al estilo de la Dianética y la Cientología. Tengan cuidado con otro ejemplo de pseudo ciencia: Tony Buzán y sus mapas mentales. Todos estos ejemplos tiene como común denominador prometer hacerlo más inteligente de lo que es. Creanme, sean inteligentes y no compren dichos libros. Se harán un gran favor. Mejor visiten sitios como el de James Randi quien se dedica a desenmascarar a charlatanes y pseudo cientificos como Wanger, Buzan, Hubbard, Uri Geller y otros.
1	Not bad: The technique of "Image Streaming" has shown promising results in certain cases. Much of the hype and propoganda, however, has been that the process can create a 20 point gain in IQ, relying on the1989 study by Dr. Charle P. Reinert, the "Reinert Study". The following link will take you to the abstract -http://www.themindaccelerator.com/research/rp2.htmThe study, however, does not detail a 20 point gain in IQ through image streaming, unless I am reading the abstract wrong. It discusses a much lower gain, less than half the advertised 20 point gain in certain circumstances. As for the validity of the test, not enough detail is noted in the abstract for one to objectively judge for themselves. Unfortunately, this discrepnancy has resulted in a diminished outlook on this technique to several persons. It is unfortunate, because the technique is worth learning and can be very beneficial when combined with other cognitive techniques, such as the Sedona Method.
1	DYNOOOO-MITE: I love this CD - Weezer and Pavement fans listen up - this CD is for you! The band uses topics such as supermodels (Dear Kate), pro-sports (G-force) and arguments with girlfriends (Anyway) to propel you into their world. My favorite song is Oltram. And the "Boyz in the Hood" cover - it'll definately stick in your head with it's melodious and rythmic quirkiness. Check it out now before it releases nationally on May 23rd. Also look for them on Farmclub.com (tv show that airs Mondays10p central) These guys made my day. Thanks Austin, TX!
1	Decent CD: The Remake of Boyz-n-the-Hood makes this CD worth buying by itself, but there are some other catchy tunes that are worth listening to also.
1	Impress Your Friends: Here is a golden opportunity for fans of alternative music to look terribly intelligent...buy this CD now, and when it is the hottest thing going this summer, you'll be the one who "saw it coming".Yes, the cover of "Boyz" is good--hysterically good--but the rest of the CD will grab you as well. Every now and then you'll discover a new song on it and find it has found its way back into your player.Great music and a chance to be a musical sage. Check it out!
1	Thank God there's a place "ware" I can find this on CD: Great album from great singer. I first heard it just a few weeks ago when I found an original1979 cassette copy from a place near my house that specializes in records and old tapes. In almost no time the disco-ish "What's Your Name" became one of my very favorite songs.
0	Bad Remake: This song when sung by Berlin was wondeful and not vocally overdone. Jessica Simpson sounds as if she is ripping her vocal chords out to hit some of the notes towards the end of the song. None of the remixed are particularly exciting and they all drag on without end. Unfortunetly, it seems as if this entire cd was rushed and hurried along; I would save my $$!
0	Dropped it and it broke: I bought the 810 model, which is similar. Worked generally fine, but because of its shape, easy to drop or fall over. I put it on top of my desktop, and accidentally it fell on the wooden floor, and since then, it has not turned on. Too fragile.
0	Don't do it !!: The first time I tried this, it damaged the camera's lens cover mechanism. The little hooks that hold it to the lense poke into the area where the covers exit the mechanism, causing it to stop working. Do not buy or use this product!!!
0	Disappointed: I'm a big Louis Prima fan but I was very disappointed with this cd. It didn't capture the excitement of a Louis Prima show.
1	The Importance of Community Development: Through statistical and qualitative analysis, this book illustrates the importance of community-wide development as a key to the economic rejuvenation of the inner city. The analysis is comprehensive and provides an excellent resource for individuals and entities involved in community development.
1	Good overall account of the war in the South: I recommend this book for those interested in a clear ande concise narrative account of the American Revolution in the South. Although not as dramatic as Buchanan's THE ROAD TO GUILFORD COURTHOUSE (which I do not recommend) Lumpkin's book is well worth reading and generally accurate. His analysis is solid, a description I would not give to THE ROAD TO GUILFORD COURTHOUSE.
0	Good idea, but not practical: We bought this so that the stroller could have shade from the front. It was hard to put on and keep stable, and the parts broke easily. Not worth it!
1	An overlooked treasure: This is one of the funniest SF books out there. I've got an old tattered copy, and I will order the new edition when it comes out. The book is full of cultural, SF and fandom references. Some might be a little dated (for example, the symbol of the sheep, the horned box, is a reference to a TV with antenna, and how many people have seen one of THOSE lately?), but overall, this book holds up very well.To answer another reviewer's question would be a spoiler, but anyone who wishes to know who Purple was based on can email me at my nickname at hotmail.
1	One of the greatest jazz records ever!: I absolutely love Tom Grants music and this record (the view from here) is a fantastic album...infact one of his best! I have seen Tom Grant live many times and he is an amazing performer and puts on an amazing live show..For anyone who buys this CD you will not be disappointed...It is truely a great cd and Tom Grant is one of the all smooth jazz greats!Regards,J.Fitzgerald
0	Animated Dean Martin Doll: I really find it difficult to rate this item for the following reason. I purchased the Dean Martin doll as a novelty item for my wife, a dedicted Dean Martin fan. Unfortunately it did not perform as expected. The mouth would not move. Fortunately I was able to return it for a full refund paid in a timely manner.
1	My daughter loves these books!: I was given our first book by Sandra Boynton as a gift when my daughter was just 6 months old. I have since then bought several more of her books and my daughter loves each.and.every.one of her books that we own! Sandra Boynton's books were literally the first books that really caught my daughter's attention and we read them every day. She is almost 8 months old now and I think she'll love them as she grows older as well. I highly recommend any of her books!
0	This book is awful!: This book has no point to it. It teaches you common sense stuff. It has no value in real life. This book is very boring and useless. A student can not read this book, it is too boring and useless. Waste of Money. This is a waste of [$]. If you have already bought this book, it can be used as pretty good fire wood, and that's what the one star is for.
1	Excellent strategy game!: I got this game for my birthday (I'm 35) and I love it! It's like a high-tech version of chess. Definitely makes you think hard and try to plot out your moves many steps in advance. It's especially tricky because you have to simultaneously think offensively and defensively. If you like classic strategic boardgames, you'll love this game.
0	CHEAP!: I was really excited about getting this for my brother for Christmas, but when we opened the package, the lasers would not fire and we could never get them to work, which is the whole point of the game, so it's pretty much trash now.
1	It makes you think: It makes you think really hard - its like chess on crack. Its the new age of chess. I don't like the form fitting box top which required resetting the pieces in a certain way to put away the game, but this probably provides better protection for the mirror surfaces.
1	9yo Son loves this game: I will start off by saying I have not personally played this game. I don't really like chess so am not super excited to play. But my son really wanted this for Christmas. I was a little leary of getting it because we have had laser games that didn't work very well in the past and ended up being a waste of money. But there wasn't much he wanted for Christmas and the reviews on Amazon were good so I got it for him.He loves it! Him and my boyfriend have played numerous times since Christmas and they are both addicted to it. My boyfriend keeps begging me to play it with him when my son isn't around. The lasers are very strong and neither of them have complained about having any issue with it working.It also seems to be very fast play. I don't think it takes them more than 20 minutes to finish a game.And I love the fact that it isn't something that has to be plugged into a TV to play and it makes you think and strategize.
1	One of the all-time best jazz singers: In the pantheon of jazz greats, I don't think it's an exaggeration to say that Nina Simone stands right up there alongside greats such as Billie Holliday. Her work even compares favorably with the instrumental giants like Coltrane or Davis; she's that good. This cd is my favorite from Simone's catalog, "Love Me or Leave Me" my favorite song. While less socially relevant than some of the other songs on this cd, it will leave YOU wanting to dance.However, ALL of the songs on this cd are great. Some make you want to boogie (yes, I said it), some make you angry, some make you want to cry, but regardless, it's hard not to be affected in some way by each of them. I'd also recommend Verve's "Nina Sings Nina" cd.
0	not for me: A reasonable price and a good beginning but what seemed to be a thriller turned into a slow love story with some mystery thrown in. Wasn't my cup of tea.
1	My first ADF book!: This book was my first exposure to Alan Dean Foster. I though the beginning was somewhat slow, but it was character development. I really loved the pendju, but I was upset when I conc was introduced. As the story continued to progress, I decided that it was actually for the better, and turned out to be an excellent book. I just wish it was longer/had a sequel... =)
1	little train that couldn't: The batteries don't last very long and the train has stopped working after a year of minimal use. It still makes the sounds but no longer moves. I love the train but would never spend this much again.
0	tried today: today was the first day with it. I have noticed no difference in appetite. directions say it may take a few days.It tastes fine.
0	No Taste: I bought these k-cups at the store to try out in my Keurig single cup coffee maker, they are horrible. Absolutely no french vanilla taste at all, it's not just a weak taste, there is NO TASTE! And to make sure it wasn't just my taste buds, I made several more cups (using1 k-cup per mug of coffee of course) for family members to see if they could guess what flavor it was, none of them knew and when I told them it was french vanilla, they were of course surprised since you can't taste anything at all.I will never buy Van Houtte again, what a waste of money.
0	How do you expect people to purchase this item?: The product description states that the sizing is based on neck size, however you don't provide any measurement with the corresponding S,M,L sizes. Are we supposed to guess at the measurements? It might be easier to shoot darts blind-folded!
0	Kindle version is Not illustrated.: It says illustrated, in my table of contents, but it is not. I only purchased this to have the illustrated version.
1	A classic with a beautiful wrapping: Wonderful book, timeless advice... plus Maira Kalman!! Her exquisite illustrations pair wonderfully with this major classic.
0	Great music, terrible DVD: What's the deal? I am a huge ABB fan, and thought this was a great show. But what the hell is up with these stupid interviews in the middle of songs... right in the middle of solos. Seriously, who would do such a stupid thing. It would be a great DVD if they had the whole show, uninterrupted. Why not just put the interviews in a whole different section or disc. If you want an Allman Brothers DVD, just get the new one from the Beacon... and hope somebody finally realizes that this DVD sucks and fixes it.
0	Disgraceful: This DVD is a disgrace. Pathetic. It's actually an outstanding film of an Allman Brothers concert, but the producers ruined it by interrupting the songs with interviews. How can they be so stupid? How can the members of The Allman Brothers allow the record company to butcher the songs like that? Don't they have enough interest in their own music to pay attention to what gets released? If you want to see the full length versions of the songs in this concert, buy the VHS version because it's all there. As for the DVD release, it's such a shame that corporations and record labels show such disrespect for music. The Allman Brothers are one of the greatest live bands of all time and there isn't very much concert footage that has been released, so why did they have to ruin this wonderful concert?
0	Like others say, stay away from the DVD!: When I bought this and took it home. I played it and was severely dissapointd. Ditto to what most other reviewers said. I took it back to Best Buy the next day. It sucks!
1	Any true Allman Borthers fan would enjoy this DVD: The sound and picture quality are great and the selection of tunes are great also. The only annoying thing was the cut in interviews in the middle of a few songs. Overall a good DVD
0	Misleading information on DVD case.: I'm disappointed like the rest. I bought the VHS version several years ago and expected an exact copy of it on the DVD. WRONG!!! To make matters worse the DVD cover says "Running Time: Approx. 90 minutes" The ACTUAL running time is 55 minutes. What a rip-off!!
0	I am glad I didn't trade in my Laserdisc!: what an incredible botch job! the laserdisc rocks! and I understand so does the vhs version...but this DVD cuts out songs...cuts up songs...and generally dissapoints...THE INTERVIEWS SHOULD BE IN ADDITION TO...NOT ..instead off SONY..get it right! and put this out AGAIN!
1	Eye Opening!: Read this book if you don't know anything about the writings of St. Paul so you can get it right straight away. Read this book if you have read others about the writings of St. Paul, for an enhanced understanding of what you think you understand about him.
0	Not a "practical handbook" for today.: This is a reprint of a book first issued in1930. It does have some fascination, for instance in the comparison of gas vs. oil lighting for your workspace. For my purposes as a beginner looking for basic methods for mechanical watch cleaning and repair, it was practically useless.It gives equal time to fusee and Geneva watches and may well be of interest to an experienced person looking for a glimpse into the past, but not reccomended as a "practical handbook."
0	I cannot rate as I have not purchased.: For over $18.00, you do not give the quantity of cans one will purchase. I'm sure one can does not cost that much. Thank you, Iva Jeane Driggers
0	I struggled to pick it up...: Never have I been so bored by a novel set in Ireland. While I found the historical aspect to be informative, the story itself was tedious and silly, with the most contrived fictional characters. I struggled to pick this book up each night (rather than put it down). I would rather read a straight history book and visit Dublin for my facts, and leave the Irish fiction to Emma Donoghue and even Maeve Binchy.
1	A Good Family Game: My eight year old son received this gift for Christmas this year and he, my husband, our six year old daughter and I all played it about five times so far. It's a nice game to play together for a variety of ages and doesn't get too competitive. It's a challenge to remember the titles of movies, characters, and even offers other challenges such as having to figure out the difference between two almost identical pictures, etc.There is even two ways to play the game, a short version and a longer regular version. You do need to be by a working TV and DVD player, but it is enjoyable and the children tend to get a kick out of seeing the video clues for many questions.I recommend this for a family or group of children old enough to work the remote of the family's DVD player. (They even have the rules on the DVD!!)
1	better than 95% of what's in your CD player: there it was,1991. i heard black metalic for the fist time and i melted into the soundscape that is the catherine wheel. cruising in a car wasn't good enough for the record because the mellower moments couldn't be audible with out blowing your ear drums on the loud parts. god bless this band, they take dynamics are taken to the max. wishville combines the catherine wheel's major strength (dynamics) and combines it with pure pop sensibility. they've nearly perfected that which is the catherine wheel.
0	.....what happened?: truly a disappointment. and that's only because Catherine Wheel need to be held at a very high standard. they have produced some fine masterpieces in the past, culminating with the show (and heart) -stopping Adam and Eve. additionally, when you have the huge talents of Tim Friese-Greene at your disposal (he created a large part of two other masterpieces, Talk Talk's Spirit of Eden and Laughing Stock - get them), you best not surface with mediocrity. well, they have. there's no texture, no diversions, no heavily-lidded emotion, no cathartic, blissful moments of sound.new record label..... firing of their bassist (? )..... many bands have tried to shake things up mid-career, hate to see another talented one follow the same fate.i'm still a fan, but this album will surely go to the bottom of (the) Catherine Wheel bin for me.
1	This game is Sweet.: If you want codes I got codes only one but its Sweet.You can get a rocket launcher by typing in this code when your hunting and you don't just want to kill it you want to blow it away that code is BHB-BQ
1	Good for my first pistol: A decent priced case for my first gun. Easily fit a 9mm Sig, along with a mag and 2x50 round boxes. Wasn't looking for anything fancy, and it delivered just what I was looking for.
0	Good case, cheap foam insert: This case is strongly made and closes well. However, the included foam inserts are very cheap and offer no support. After carefully making cut-outs for my XD-9, I found that the foam was too feeble to support the gun properly and just looked cheap and saggy.After a difficult search on the web, I discovered another case maker, Pelican (on ebay), that sold replacement foam inserts, which I ordered. I found these to be of far better quality and well support the gun and accessories.In the end, it would have been cheaper and easier to have just bought the case from Pelican in the first place.To be honest, even the Pelican foam is not as good as the foam I used to use in the UK to carry heavy cameras in alluminum cases. That foam had a velvet surface and was extremely firm, but God only knows where to buy that!
1	Great product: I looked at another pistol case in a store that was selling for the same price, and this one was much, much better. For what they're charging, I don't think you can beat the quality. The shipping was most prompt as well.
1	does what it's supposed to do: Got this for my Ruger P95. Plenty of room for the gun, both15 round clips and the speed loader.
1	agood quality case: I bought this particular case for my CO2 pistol and was able to get the pistol, 5 co2 cartridges and one 350 count bb tube into it.
1	Excellent for revolver storage: You can't beat this for the price for storing a handgun. I keep a S&W 357 magnum and 3 speedloaders in the case. Quality is good overal plastic. The latches work fine and appear to be decent for plastic.
1	For public radio insiders and those who wished they were.: If you're a public radio fan wanting to know what Garrison Keillor is really like, or how angry Bob Edwards actually got when he exited Morning Edition unwillingly after almost 25 years as host, this is not the book for you. It is a highly readable, highly personal perspective on the philosophies and politics that shaped NPR and made public radio a force in American media. Those most apt to appreciate it are among the thousands of people who have been employed in public radio over the last 30 years -- including career veterans who will recognize the names and remember the events that Mitchell recalls.
1	Excellent as a drama on the lives of prostitutes but only fair as a thriller: Intelligent if slightly awkward melding of a gritty, sad drama of life of the street for working classprostitutes in the UK, and a somewhat more melodramatic and soapy (if sometimes quite tense)serial killer thriller.Unlike `Klute' where the world of hustling and thriller melded seamlessly, here there is a bit moreschizophrenia between the elements. For me, the crime sections, while sometimes effective, werealso quite familiar, and felt like TV and movies I'd seen many times before, whereas the portrait ofthe day to day lives of hustlers felt like much more interesting and less often explored in anon-exploitive way. The killings and investigation feel oddly grafted on.
0	Welcome to1995!: I am so sick of these things being released without CDMA/EVDO or some cell service. From Nokia of ALL COMPANIES!Get with the times and offer an internet device that doesn't require me to be in 50 feet of a damn router.
1	Pequeño y cumplidor: El Nokia N800 es muy practico para el uso diario por su reducido tamaño, su bateria dura lo justo para el uso que se le puede dar. Logicamente por lo limitado en tamaño de su pantalla no sustituye a un Laptop pero si ayuda mucho para estar conectado a la internet y mantenerse comunicado con los amigos y relacionados.
1	Great for my needs: I wanted a device that could give me the web browsing capabilities and mp3 player without the price and weight of a laptop. This fits the requirements well. It requires some tinkering to get things just right. If you don't want to tinker, get an iPod touch. Otherwise this is great.
1	best gadget ever...: im writing this review from my n800 nice device, a lot of app, nokia releases a new os evry 2 months, i liked it!
0	Does not power up after initial charge: This item arrived DOA after initial Charge. The replacement also did not start after initial charge. I was able to get it to start after removing the battery for 5 hours. Then it worked great until I powered down, then the same problem. I could not get the update software to find the device even though windows Xp found and gave it a drive designation. I thought upgrading the OS system would fix the power problem. Nokia support could not help, I was told to send the unit in for warranty repair. When it was working for the short time it was promising. Maybe just a bad batch, I think I'll order the N810 instead and cross my fingers.
1	Great Puzzle: I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of this puzzle. Good chunky pieces that the little ones can handle and all tidies away into a great little case. Well worth the price and makes a great gift for toddlers learning their association and coordination.
1	Fear: From the boy next door to every girls worst nightmare in a heart beat. A thriller that lets you love and hate the same character at the same time. Twists and turns keep your eyes glued to the television and Mark Walbergs gentle stare keeps you loving a psychotic. The ending keeps those who enjoyed the movie hoping for more. An ending scene with police divers keeps those who noticed it wondering, was he alive or was he dead? Just who's body were they looking for?
0	Umm... Nah: Well this movie started off semi-enjoyable. An early shower scene of Reese Witherspoon made me happy. Thie movie sets up with a father-daughter conflict that you've seen in hundreds of other movies. Enter Marky Mark, sweeping the girl off her feet. Then comes the part when the girl argues a lot with the father. And so on... we've all seen this before. It seems like the writer ran out of ideas at the end of the movie, though. Or perhaps he was getting bored with all the build-up he was creating with the characters that he was just like "Alright, screw the rest of the plot, lets get to the action." And so he does. And soon after the movie ends at a seemingly premature1hr.16min. Woohoo.Don't waste your money on this DVD, or even the rental, they play it all the time on USA or the like.
0	Terrible Service: I am completely annoyed with this company. I ordered a movie and they sent the wrong one. Instead of just sending me the right one, they are making me go through this ridiculous process by sending the other one back before they send the right one even though it was their mistake. It was supposre to be a christmas gift and basically it was ruined.
1	The Very Best: This is quite possibly one of the ten finest Albums/CDs every recorded. The Byrds at this time were the best the 60s had to offer and the 60s was the time period that mattered. The songwriting by Crosby in particular was genius. I love the Byrds, I miss Gene Clark, and I only wish this early version of the Byrds could have given us even more output before the break-ups and decline into the "Rodeo" format. Yes, the muscianship of "Mcguin's" country Byrds was truly groundbreaking but the songwriting was not even close. Get this one for a real trip.
0	not delivered: thanks for nothing. I sent this product to Qatar. now some random guy in Vegas has a new prisma color art set for free. and there is no way I can contact anyone. $230 right Out the window.
0	way too violent for children: we just rented this movie and while my 9-year old liked it, my 6-year old was terrified, with good reason. Lots of violence and cruelty that just went on and on. I had some Babar books as a child and was expecting something similar- I was shocked and angry that someone decided to turn it into some kind of a cartoon Tarentino movie. Yes, eventually Babar does prevail, but in the meantime, there's enough graphic scary imagery to fuel many kid nightmares. Too many kid movies today seem to be designed for adults, and this is definitely one
0	Buffalo Girls: The original version of this movie was great. Huston is superb as Calamity Jane, and Melanie Griffith is a great madame.But this version has been hacked to death by some uncaring editor. It has lost it's continuity and is very dissappointing.
0	North to the Orient (Harbrace Paperbacks Library): This particular printing may be authentic to the period but the print is very difficult to read. It is dizzying.
0	iLuv I707BLK iPod FM Transmitter: This is a neat device and works quite well. DO NOT BUY ONE FOR AN 8GIG 5th GENERATION iPod. YOU WILL HAVE TO EXTENSIVELY MODIFY IT TO FIT. Well, Mrs. Lincoln, other than the shooting, how was the play? Also, iLuv is snotty about it not fitting. It took hours to cut the slot bigger, knock off the two tabs, then measure and epoxy the holder to the unit in the proper position. iLuv could easily make an inexpensive adapter! It works fine now, however.UPDATE: This device does NOT seem to charge my iPod when it is plugged in to it AND if you leave the iPod in the device in also seems to DISCHARGE the iPod.
1	still working: I've had this unit now for two years and it still works like a champ for an FM transmitter. There's static on some channels when I travel, but I'm competing against much higher bandwidth. Worth the money for someone looking to just enjoy their tunes without a full audio facelift.
1	loved it: my baby is10 months old and fits very comfortable in this, the fabric that covers it is great quality and is very flexible and easy to inflate, but not to easy to fold back in the original shape to fit in the bag.
0	Suggested Age.....6 years??????: I think that the only reason that the manufacturer recommends this "toy" for ages 6 and up is to avoid a law suit, they don't want to be responsible for any baby drownings or injuries. The only thing I can think of that my 7 year old would do with this is to play water frisbee. I used to like products from this manufacturer but if they cannot even stand behind their own product safety then it is time to make a return. Don't buy this if you haven't yet, it is not worth your babies safety.
0	Waste of money: It would be safer to have just held my son. We thought this was cool becasue we wouldn't have to blow it up, but no....that's not the problem, now the problem is he just falls forward so his face is in the water....! I'd much rather waste my breath to blow up a floater so my son can keep his breath free of water. Nice waste of money, if they ever redesign this, the need to try to make it more stable. It's not like we just stuck him in there once & gave up on it, we've tried this thing over & over again months upon months to see if maybe it was his age...nope it's the item, even when other children try it, it's the same thing. Please don't buy this & look away from your child for a second, you could be making a horrible mistake.
1	Read the manufacturers recom age!!!: According to the manufacturer this toy is for 6 YEARS and up! Fun for OLDER kids!
1	Super fun float for my toddler: My son who is going to be 2 soon simple loves this float. He hates getting into our bath tub and used to cry a lot. So when i came across this float on Amazon i wondered if it will ever be used, but just gave it a shot and Lo and Behold...... it was magic!!!! my son sits in it in the pool and keeps singing to himself. This float is pretty sturdy and doesnt topple. And the netted area between the 2 concentric tubes makes it all the more fun as the water becomes reachable for the kid to play and splash but at the same time keeping him safe :) He is hyper active when inside the pool, jumping crazy and stuff but still the float stands sturdy!!! The air seems to go out if not used for 2-3 days, donno if its common or not, but i have a balloon pump that comes in handy. i recommend to parents who want their kids to like water :)
1	Wedding planning with a twist!: Carolyn is a wedding planner that helps plan a wedding for Sheik Tarik's sister which is only a month away. Carolyn is surprised that the bride & groom are not involved in the planning at all. Sheik Tarik is planning everything which keeps her wondering why. As they get to know each other Carolyn & Sheik Tarik begin to fall in love. Of course there are misunderstandings but they work them out... until Carolyn learns that the wedding is arranged and against the sister's wishes. There are some good twists and turns throughout the story which keeps things interesting. I enjoyed reading this book and hope you will like it too. There is a sequel to this book on Carolyn's friend Anne called "Taming the Sheik" by Carol Grace. One of the sheik's cousins mentioned in this book is the hero in the sequel. Enjoy!
0	product never worked. manufacturer does not stand behind their product.: This product ruined at least 3 brand new batteries. Amazon refuses to do anything about it and the manufacturer will not stand behind their product. I will never use amazon or a schumacher product again. If the product is "as is" I may as well buy it used for a fraction of the cost.
0	Horrified: My husband got this as a hand me down and started reading it today. I glanced at the page he had open and am horrified at what I read. Page 8 in the grey box titled "Age Differences" and I quote "For the first 6 months, infants do not feel love and affection. They are wholly dependent on their caretakers to have their needs met-that's all". What old school garbage! As a mother of a 3 week old it's already obvious to me that my daughter feels love and affection.
0	Really pretty lame: There really isn't anything new in here and just states the obvious like don't beat your kids and love them. Not worth the money.
0	A mistake: I accidently bought two copies of this DVD. Most of the people who gave it 5 stars had to be gaming the system.
1	ONE OF THE BEST MOVIES MADE: Please come out with a DVD version of this masterpiece as soon as possible. I saw this movie many years ago, and never thought I'd see it again. If it had not been for all your reviews, I would not have known it was this movie. Yes, this is the ultimate 'primitive' movie...definitely much better than 'Clan of the Cave Bears'. Here are the things you'll see : hairy cavemen, cannibals, neanderthals, sabre-tooth tigers, mammoths, pigmies, great landscapes and sceneries. The movie will humble you and make you think how precious the most basic necessities of life really is. You'll experience love, sex, tribal wars, sadness, humor. And for the last time, forget the historical experts that always claim some movie is bad because its historically inaccurate. I won't trade this movie for 99% of the Hollywood movies out there today!
1	Quest for fire review: My recent purchase of "Quest for fire" from Amazon.com was a great experience. The DVD arrived on time and in very good condition. The film was a joy to see again. the screening went very well, as the movie was very clear with great sound. I highly recommend Amazon.com for your next DVD purchase.
1	Skechers Chiefs Sneakers: Nice shoes for a good price. Cant beat that for growing boys! And they love the easy on/off style.
1	Good: Does not surpass War All The Time but still pretty f-ing solid. Check out Autumn Leaves Revisited.
0	Kindle version has problems: This Kindle version of the book has quite a few typographical errors. I could usually make them out, but it IS irritating. This review is for this version of the book not "Boots And Saddles" itself (which I found to be a very enjoyable read!).
1	Exactly what we wanted: I found this by scanning the bar code of a friends hat. We got the package quickly and it was exactly what we ordered.
0	Too Much Attitude: Bridgewater's theatrical experience definitely works against her on this CD. The vocal posturing annoys and distracts. Her material is excellent, and her band really cooks. Drop the coy mannerisms and just sing, Dee Dee.
1	The Bishop's Wife: One of my favorite Christmas movies, I have watched it every year. Still a classic film with a wonderful cast. They can remake it over and over this will always be my favorite
1	A Beautiful Story: No blood or guts... just wonderful characters showing what love really is ! Don't miss seeing this one if you haven't already. Great for Christmas!
1	gasket cement for Big Green Egg: This is the best cement I've yet used for keeping my replacement gasket in place on my Big Green Egg. I'm now using a fiberglass stove gasket, and it's worked the best of any I've tried. This is easy to apply and holds up to the heat better than the black stuff I used before.
0	Vague Explanations: This book contains very good practice material but the explanations to the answer choices are very vague and difficult to understand.
0	It's not worth it; it's a waste of time: This is a very good if you need a brush up on the very basics like percentage and fractions. This is the first 200 pages and it is very easy. It gives you a sense of achievement and wrongly makes you think you will ace the SAT. The SAT is not this easy...The harder concepts are poorly explained. Explanations to practice questions and tests are extremely shallow and vague. Some of the techniques are much too convoluted and take too much time. There are better strategies than what this book offers.
0	If These Walls Could Talk 2 (2000 TV Movie): THe song of the title menu sung by two women in the same beautiful style of THE FLOWER DUET from LAKMÉ by Delibes, is Antonio Vivaldi's Concerto in G major for two guitars/mandolins , ADAGIO. I don't know who is performimg the beautiful song. I have been trying to find it in other CD but it seems almost impossible. can anyone help me? israelonofre@yahoo.com.br
0	Sweetened with Sucralose: Real kettle popcorn is sweetened with sugar and is a real tasty snack.Unfortunately sugar burns in the microwave so Orville Redenbacher (ConAgra Foods) have sweetened this with sucralose.Sucralose is definitely something I wouldn't give to my kid. Read all about it online.
0	Would be a better value with quality batteries: Unit worked well for what it is, a small and versatile glue gun for small home repairs and crafts. The batteries are really really bad. And unfortunately they did not build in an adapter to use the included AC plug. That would have been helpful so that when the batteries die we could still use the unit. Bad engineering.Buy a corded gun if you are serious and never worry about batteries again.
1	You must have a copy of this book for your own!: I read Cheaper by the Dozen more than 20 years ago in Thai edition. And I bought it to all of my friend for presents. This is a book you must have in your house. Now I am about to buy the original/English version. I still read it every time I found it at the bookstore. I love this book.
1	Charming, if dated: This is a truly charming book that will make you laugh, cry, and all that jazz. It is a bit better than the movie version, and light years above the stage version. The stories of a family living with an efficiancy expert is funny enough, the fact that there are12 kids (well, actually11 b/c one dies of diptheria when she is really young) makes it all the funnier. Unfortunatly, this book is rather dated as is apparent by he considerable racism. (The Parents perform a minstrel show for their children, anything taboo is deemed "eskimo," the sterotypical portrayel of a chinease cook, etc.) Fortuately, this parts are easiyl skipped over, though they really should be cut. Read this book, it is genuinly touching and has some nice lessons about family, but I would recommend editing it before you share it with impressionable young children.
1	The book is a masterpice: I have been addicted to this real life story for over 25 years. I've starred as Mother Gilbreth on stage and also directed the production. I will be directing it again because it has everything audiences want...humor, honesty,character development and bittersweet reality. It's a family show that focuses on parenting and family unity. I'll be staging it at The Barn Theatre in Stuart Sept 24th - Oct10th. Auditions are August 8th, 9th and10th at 7pm at The Barn Theatre, 2400 E. Ocean Blvd., Stuart.
1	NOT for Modern Readers: This book should be read by everyone and anyone who is able to appreciate good Victorian literature, George Eliot's THE MILL ON THE FLOSS is one of the greatest creations. Too bad she isn't getting all the hype flowery Austen and quite dull Forster is getting in Hollywood.
1	Sublime is the Word.: From "Lady is A Tramp" to "How High the Moon" to her unique improvisation on "Mack the Knife"...Miss Ella Fitzgerald shows us that she is the jazz vocalist genius of all time. Sublime, Brilliant, Legendary...this album captures it all. A must for any Ella fan and every jazz fan.
1	Wagner out West: Most of the young stars here perform very well in a high production western that is'nt quite as good as the sum of it's parts. Wagner is'nt bad, Debra Paget is good as always but Jeff Hunter is slightly miscast, though he works quite hard. I liked the feel of time and place this film has and it still retains a sweep and grandour which must have looked great on its original cinema outing.What else can I say. I thoroughly enjoyed it even with its shortcommings and can recommend it even on repeated viewings though widescreen works best for the full-bodied western vistas.
1	Worked great: This product worked exactly as I had hoped. I did not feel like I had to keep running to the bathroom. It was controlled and effective.
1	Dr. Hahn helps to breathe life into our prayer: Dr. Hahn has performed yet another great service for the Church (and the whole world, for that matter). The Our Father is Gospel prayer, the prayer that Jesus Himself gave to us. If prayer is oxygen for the soul, then Dr. Hahn has helped to breathe life into our prayer. In the light of four Fathers of the Church, as well as his own excellent insights, Dr. Hahn, a teacher in the Teacher, teaches us how to pray.
0	Dissapointing!: Having gone through the first 3 chapters of this book, I must say I am really dissapointed. The author is supposedly trying to avoid the mathematical rigor to the account of explaining things in a physical way. Well, he almost completely fails in that and, the worst, confuses the reader. For example, he devotes15 pages to smoothly introduce the reader to the concept of a manifold, promising a more rigorous definition to be given later on. When the time comes, he uses two "brand new" concepts, namely Haussdorf space and countable base, for the meaning of which, the reader has to look up in other books!(however cited in bibliography) If one wants to understand what all these things (manifolds, diff. forms, Lie deriv, etc.) are about, the best thing to do is buy a mathematical book. After all, it is hardly possible to satisfactorily describe abstract mathematical concepts if you avoid using mathematical language! For the interested, I am NOT a mathematician.
0	False Advertising: Although this book may contain over 30,000 foods, (not just 20,000 as the synopsis claims) it only contains sodium, calorie and fat statistics for them. I bought this book looking for the potassium values that the synopsis suggested it contains. It does not. My sole purpose for purchasing this book was falsely advertised in the synopsis and thus this book is absolutely useless to me. Thanks for nothing.
0	Booo! Bad writing. Bad, bad writing.: Does anyone say "Crazy getup"? If they do, I wish they wouldn't. There's too many examples of bad cliche writing in this that I don't have time to point them all out. I was looking for a good time travel romance. This isn't it.
0	did not survive battery change: Its light was okay, although it could not quite cover an entire page of a book. The main problem is it's too shabby to survive a battery change--so you will get just 40 hours of use before it runs out. Also, finding 3V Lithium batteries is not easy.
0	Just didn't care for it.: I played a couple of adventure games (Syberia and another one I don't recall) and I got really enthralled by this game genre, so, based on everyone's review, I got this one.Technical issues aside, I just couldn't get drawn into it. The story is too new-agey, too "evil white males vs pure frolicking happy people", etc etc. I just couldn't get to care for the main character, for the plot (I found myself rooting for the bad guys), and would get annoyed at the choices I was given.After enduring the first chapter, I had enough and uninstalled it.The graphics (dated, but good) and execution (didn't encounter a single bug) save this one from a1 star rating.
0	Too Much Like Work: If I want to read a cultural history of the United States in the nineteenth century, then I read a cultural history of the United States in the nineteenth century. This boring, pretentious, rambling, self-involved, pontificating mess passes itself off as fiction, but it reads like one of those junior-high assignments where students are told to imagine themselves living in another time or place. How on earth it could have received a National Book Award is a mystery, even considering the spotty reputation of the award. One or two times I began to feel swept up in the narrative (I appreciated Bogdan's journal entries, his unrequited pining for lovely young boys), but quickly enough that narrative flow was dammed by another lengthy, boring letter or monologue. I would refer those who want to read a masterful book about an eastern European artist coming to America in the nineteenth century to read Josef Skvorecky's 'Dvorak in Love'. Now there's a book!
0	Stereo installition kit - Hyundai: The product is as described but the only thing that would fit was the side pieces. There was no place to mount the bracket to the radio. Rather than start over just taped it to radio and mounted the screws. Seems to be holding soo far.
0	African Architecture: Hugely disappointing. This book promises more than it really delivers. Having lived and worked as an architect in Africa, I found theresearch superficial and use of outdated references gives african architecture a less than positve image.I dont recoomend this book at all.
1	A moving call to re-examine the Bible: When I ordered this book, I expected it to be a defense of the Protestant position of Sola Scriptura, but to my surprise it is instead aimed at correcting liberal Christian views of how we form relationships with God. The book opens with a story of a Christian woman who was waiting for God to tell her directly that she should make amends with her estranged parents, when a friend told her to open her Bible to Exodus 20:12 and read.The book proceeds in this direction emploring the reader to use his or her Bible as a means to form a personal relationship with God rather than expecting God to speak by direct revelation. It also briefly defends the authority of the Bible against such attacks as higher criticism and the Jesus Seminar.Despite the "Why" in the title, I would have to say that it is more pastoral than apologetic. Even so, I recommend it.
1	One Tree Hill's Road Mix: I only bought this CD because I've been watching One Tree Hill from the very first season (and b/c of that hot James Lafferty, bka Nathan Scott). This CD is so good. I've listened to this CD in my car CD player for about the last 6 months!
1	Middle Eastern fever: Highly energetic and downright rowdy quartet.It's hard to tell where improv ends & Khalife begins; brilliant~This group obviously plays together seamlessly -- like the Beatles over time.I'm sending JADAL to my percussionist grandson, along with Alhaj's "When the Soul is Settled" CD. Oud masters both, yet so delightfully different.
1	Good horse - PAIN to assemble: The horse seems sturdy but to the person who said it took15 minutes to assemble they must be superman. My husband and I just finished putting it together for Christmas and it took us at least an hour. The instructions are horrible and the springs are a nightmare to hook together. We never did get the "safety" hook in. ADVICE: put on the spring covers BEFORE hooking the safety straps to the wooden pegs. The instructions say the other way around but that is impossible.It does seems sturdy though and I like the sounds. I'm sure our 2 yr old will love it in the morning.
1	grand daughter loved it: gand daughter loved it, she loves the sounds it makeswas easy to put togetherliked the safety strapswould recommend to others
1	bossa carioca: First time I heard this album was sometime 2001.Was i surprised to know that the name did not sound brazilian.Who is this singer with such a light and mellow voice it was just so very pleasing to listen to.I bought the album the following day.Some more albums in the coming days.The albums now are one of my precious collections.Hoping against hope english versions come our way soonest.jun/los angeles,ca,usa
1	A Great Find: A friend wanted this book for Christmas, and I wasn't sure I would be able to locate it in time. I was pleased to find it on Amazon and ordered it. It arrived very promptly and in excellent condition. My friend was very happy with it as a gift.
1	Change the world: I believe this book has the power to transform the way you view life. I am a teacher and I discuss this book in my class. It is always intriguing to the kids. I now raffle it off at the end of the year and I can't tell you how happy the students are to receive it. It opens their eyes to how important their thoughts and feelings are. That is a wonderful gift to give a child.
0	More than just a little bit flaky...: Well, yeah, I saw "What the *bleep* Do We Know" and got very excited and bought all of these books. While I appreciate Mr Emoto's subtley and humility in presenting his work, it winds up being just as hard to stomach that much of it is thinly veiled hoopla with little or no solid science behind it. He fails to explain how many photos he took of each kind of water he photographed for instance-- there are just too many gaping holes. But hey, what the bleep do I know? When it comes down too it, I think this sort of physics, philospohy/spiritual theory of everything-- kind of stuff is just as undocumentable and faith based as any other sort of religious ideology. More than just a little bit disappointing for those of us who are still looking.
0	A new view of water: Pretty pictures, intriguing idea, but little information to back it up. What was the methodology? Have the results been replicated? Where is the science here? Lightweight.
1	Respect for Life: I saw this book at the Dahn Yoga and Healing Centers where I attend classes. I have had basic and advanced Healing training from Dahn Yoga and our last class was how to make healing water. This book illustrates what anger and violence as well as pollution do to our bodies which are made up of 70% water. My daughter borrowed the book the day after I got it and I am waiting for her to return it. Every human being should read this book and understand how their actions react on other humans. Superb book!
1	Fabulous book for the young reader: This book is based in fact, and done so very well. I have given it only four stars as the majority of the story, such as the dialogues and day-to-day happenings, is fiction. The young reader, such as my son, may very well take that book as all fact.The author has done a great job bringing the young reader into the adventures that Lewis and Clark experienced through the use of Seaman, the dog, Her use of historical reference such as the diaries kept my the Captains and other written accounts kept by the members of the Corps of Discovery reflect the importance and difficulties of the jouney. Seaman is the comic relief in the story and keeps the young reader interested and giggling. I learned a few things by reading this book myself.As a mother and historian, I recommend this book highly for the young reader.
0	Crap, just crap: Book is highly boring as restates the same thing over and over. There is barely any thrilling action and the dog reads more like a background character than the main one. The book makes me sleep as the lewis and clark story is the most boring of all american history events. And this is of all the crap that is american history. Because they are just so boring. OMG they are traveling west, wow, do I give a ****. Plus just because your american and the story is american doesn't make it great you mother*******. **** you. Hope the book rots in hell.
0	A book for the completist: I am just reading the Hornblower series for the first time and reading them in the publishers order. Hornblower During The Crisis is an unfinished book, seriously unfinished, the main story only runs129 pages and would have been wonderful if he had finished the novel (the author passed away). Bundled with 2 other very short stories this book really isn't worth the price.
1	Time filler: This book, the Cry of the Humble, is written with a purpose. It wants to be a compilation of different and short subjects. Who has time to read 600 page books and, besides the other daily rememberances, to be able to recall what you have read yesterday? This book treats most every situation one can meet in life in short recall. Put the book in your grip, read a couple pages while waiting for the bus or any other occasion.
1	correction to a previous review: The word "robot" comes from the Czech word "robota," which in English means "corvee," the obliged labor or servitude that vassals (such as serfs or peasants) had to perform on the lords' estates.
0	Disappointed: Having just read Vanishing Florida by David T. Warner, I was anticipating another look into a native's perspective of old Florida. While Warner's book was engaging, enlightening and entertaining, this one was not. It was mostly a dry historical perspective of the author's family which wasn't that interesting.
0	The author must be an extremely annoying snob.: For a history book, the research and footnotes were not very substantial. Historians have been getting a lot of negative publicity lately for less that exemplary scholarhip. Since this is not a very important book it will not be scrutinized the way Doris Kerns Goodwin or Joseph J.Ellis would be if they were to write about Florida. I felt like someone was snearing at me throughout the book. It seemed more like a big long blog. I'd love to read more about Florida history since so many friends live there now, but I truly hated this book.
1	Life vest: This is a good quality life vest. I am pleased with the fit and feel. I wear it faithfully on our boat!
1	A mob classic!: This is a great movie! If you are into mob movies, this is a must-have. It is a classic and the cast of actors is incredible.
1	great!!: I have never seen this movie, and a friend kept talking about it.....what a great story! And the cast is superb!
0	COPY: This is just a copy of the movie. It is not an original. The DVD was burned on a DVD-R. The labels are nice but the DVD does not contain any menu features at all.
1	good: this is the best a+ book i have been reading easy to understand and brilliant video plenty of studying about core hardware i wish there was more of it especially about windows.good questions and answers programme pity it stops before you you even reach halfway.thank youpraful
1	No Knowledge to success: I could play games and do word processing. If I had a problem I would reload my computer and start over. I'm retired with such outdated skills and physical disabilities that I was unemployable. Started school at NACC in Burbank,California went to class for ten weeks on weekends, read their texts and then bought A+ Certification before testing. I read it through twice, took both CompTIA core and dos adaptive exams the same morning and passed very comfortably.Without this book to put it together from start to finish I would have had to study longer and harder.My only suggestion is in making the Operating System Architecture section more simplified like it is in A+ Dos/Windows second edition Chapter 3 by David Groth.
1	Wow, finally.: I have been looking for a book like this. Trust me. Just follow the book through from cover to cover and take notes for things he emphasizes and then do the practice questions in the book and on the cd. You will pass the exam! Make sure you have a computer to screw around with as well. His tips can be tested and it will help steer you out of confusing questions on the exam because you know which scenarios will not work. I just wrote the core hardware and scored a 913 and i expect to do the same for the operating systems exam next week. (...) remember Comptia's tests are adaptive and you only have thirty minutes. with his book i was done in eleven minutes. Way to go Mikey. Keep up the good work. Every computer technician should have a copy!
1	A+ review: This is a plain language, very detailed book that I would recomend for some one who knows nothing about computers. The hardware section goes into all the detail you need to know for the A+ and then some. All the while it is easy to understand even if you are veging. The software section goes into what you will need to know as well, but you will need to pay a little more attention to what he is writing about if you want to pass. I get the impression this guy really knows what he is talking about. A lot of illustrations.
1	The best book for A+: I passed the A+ Core 84% and I am going for the DOS/Win this week. This book is very good! Very detail compare with other A+ book.
1	Great!: Great quality for the price and does everything i need it to do, it is very large, like the size of a clothing iron about.
0	Not worth the $$$$: We love the idea of this table but found several main problems:1) Cheaply made-- the legs on aon put his foot through the hole in one of the benches while standing on it, which is very dangerous and if my husband hadn't been there to catch him, he would have fallen over with his foot still stuck in the bench3) Stains easily--even crayon marks don't wipe off easily from the surface of this table and marker stains are permanentAll in all, not happy with this product particularly for the price
0	Bradbury Something Wicked This Way Comes: Surprised at what a dud this story felt like, after my other experiences with Bradbury...there is a movie version, and that is equally awful. Not at all what I was expecting.
1	One of his best: How can you go wrong with a Ray Bradbury story....I sent this to my17 year old grandson as an introduction to other fiction.
0	It's OKAY: There's a lot of hype about this being classic literature, and one of the best genre books ever. I disagree. Although Ray Bradbury is a superb writer, this book seems to fall short. The writing is overly poetic, and the dialogue is clunky. If you read this you may find yourself re-reading sentences to figure out what the hell was being said. Although not from the book, there are many, too many, sentences like this:"Will ran, didn't run. Jumped, didn't jump. He stomped his feet on elephant shadows and cat whisker winds."Again, this isn't an actual sentence from the book, but something similar to the type of writing.Buy it, read it, experience it. These reveiws are just a matter of taste anyway. The book simply left me
0	Something Wicked This Way Comes: Ray Bradbury's Something Wicked This Way Comes is a tour de force in the over-use of metaphor and simile to the point that the reader must strain to follow the actual plot without being led repeatedly astray. The author also misuses words intentionally, for effect it seems, but to no discernible advantage. However, there is genius in the creative imagination that went into the plot - no doubt grist for a successful movie - where of course the metaphors and similes fade away as the screen writers and director are forced to visually develop the plot for the viewers. In toto, an very unenjoyably read.
1	Loved it!: Something Wicked This Way Comes was a very interesting read for me. I don't think I've ever read a book quite like this before (this is my first Bradbury novel).The novel itself it beautifully written--at times, almost magical. Bradbury's prose is more along the lines of poetry at many points. This is a positive and also a negative. On the positive side, I think it adds an eeriness to the story. On the negative side, if you aren't used to reading this style of storytelling, it could very well hinder the story and cause disinterest. At first, I was put off by the poetic style. However, the more I read the more I began to enjoy it.I love the "evil carnival comes to town" theme. I liked the main characters, two kids named Will and Jim. I loved the relationship Will has with his father.As much as I liked this book, I couldn't give it 5 stars. I thought the ending was a bit, well, cheesy (for lack of a better word). But, even with that it was a really good novel and I enjoyed it tremendously.
0	Not For Me...: So I don't really understand why this is considered a horror novel? I feel that it was made for children and Bradbury's writing style is a little confusing at times and kind of bland. I thought of it as more of an adventure story then anything. If you want something that is scary then this is not for you. I am a huge horror book nut but this book just didn't do it for me at all.
1	Best Book Ever: This may be the best book ever written by a human being. Next to the Bible and Shakespeare, there are few better books. This is one of the first books I ever read on the chronic pain problems around the world, and how to get over them. Her work with people suffering from chronic pain is an inspiration to writers everywhere. The stories of people being misdiagnosed as "simply depressed" was insightful. It is a clear, and easy to read book. Yet it has many detailed facts, and interviews. I was suffering from chronic pain greatly when I read this, and her chapters on herbal vitamins to take helped me greatly! I was very moody before, and this helped without drugs! Her tips on how to write about your pain to help get outside your pain very insightful. I loved this book, and I think it is a great work for anyone dealing with chronic pain.
1	Great book!: I think this is a great book for anyone who might suspect they have endo or was just diagnosed with it. It was a great read lots of info!
1	Emily Richrds needs a recording contract!: I just love her music, especially "Lie To Me". She captures the passion and essence of love and life. It's like listening to the energy people give off. I wish more people could experience her trur talent. Good Driving Stuff!
1	Specialized area of interest - excellent book: Got it as a gift for one who loves this writer. He enjoyed it very much.
1	Thumbs up!: C-balance is an excellent product from a trusted hobbyist turned vendor Julian Sprung, this is also the best price available anywhere.
0	Too Bulky!: When I put this on my car visor, it was visually distracting and made me feel claustrophobic! Having 30 CDs hanging over my head is just not a good idea. I tried to give it to my husband, but he thought the same thing, and got a smaller one that holds10 CDs. Much better.
0	Terrible book: Considering that this book is the10th edition, I would not want to see what the previous editions looked like. This book is full of mistakes, both editorial and technical.Don't buy this book unless you absolutely have to for a class. If you do have to, look for the best price on a used book, don't bother to buy a new one, you will NOT want to keep it.This book has some of the worst examples I have ever seen. The examples are so convoluted that there usually isn't a straight forward answer to most of the problems. This has been verified by looking in the instructors version of the book.
0	Not polished or put together very well: I had to buy this book for a Masters degree course. I think a fair amount of data is contained within the text but the organization style is not that good. The author drops hints that he has been writing this book for a long time and that it has helped some major names in the database world find inspiration... that's all well and good but a good book does this not make.The price is obviously way too much for something that is not really a practical guide. Most of the people that buy it will likely only be buying it because they are forced to. What a shame...it would be much nicer to have a quality product to learn from. This is not it in my opinion. It could be done better.
1	Nice item for what it does: I'd used this adapter with my Canon SX30IS to place polaraized, coloraized and neutral filter of 58mm, 'cause I like big filters better. I'd to zoom a little to get rid of the black corner, but is perfect after that.
0	Predictable, simplistic and boring: I found this book to be so predictable, the story line was too simple...there was no depth to the story or to the characters....and I had a hard time sticking with it. The whole story focuses on this woman's issues with her own father that she then transfers to the father of her student. How do they fall in love? I haven't a clue because there was absolutely no story there to give that scenario any meat or background. I'm just saying.....I see the author has other books...I hope they are better for the sake of those who buy them.
1	a very delicate writing: A curiosity of between a fiction and a true story makes me read this book. I really like "the Lover", it's one of my favorite book to recommand others, even though I don't like much Duras.The writing is so short, like pieces of puzzle, there is no order to explain. Duras wrote what she felt, thought spontaneously in a paragragh after another. This book is descriptive and the flow of feelings is so delicate. Especially, the reflections about the life that Duras explained in this story, are truly profound and even sorrowful for me.There is no tension, no exposed conflict, the story moves so still like the calm ocean. The tranquility in rich thoughtful description, that's why I like this novel.
0	hard to follow: I don't care for the author's abuse of the time line. Duras' character development is firm, but her flashbacks are ill timed and confusing. Duras' message of using the women's body as a form of control and yet making the main character seem separated from her body doesn't seem to really say anything.
0	One dominant flavor that didn't work for me personally: I would not buy this particular Yogi Tea again because I hate the taste of licorice/anise. The flavor of the licorice and fennel seed is very dominant, making it a sort of sickly sweet flavor which wasn't what I was hoping for with my burning throat. I think a better blend would be something with more "heat" like ginger, which is why I usually drink Yogi's Cold Season instead, for the same purpose.With a sore throat, its reasonable to suffer through a yucky flavor if it makes a discernible difference but this tea didn't do that.
1	Oh lord!: This is the DEFINITIVE Count Basie + Williams album! IT DOES NOT get any better than this!Of special credit:"Everyday" <--Easily the best arragement--EVER!"Please Send me Someone to Love" <--Ditto.etc etcBUY ITLISTEN TO ITLOVE IT!
1	Blown away!: I had the great pleasure of spending some time with Johnnie Lee and her dear friend Asia about 20 years ago. She told me she was a singer, but I never had the opportunity to hear her perform --- until now!! All I can say is WOW! I'm truly proud of her. This disc is nothing short of sensational. Rock, blues, jazz --- Johnnie Lee has all the bases covered, and with an incredible variety of texture and tone. There is real passion in every song, and some of these melodies had to have been very difficult to master. I'm so happy to have found, quite by accident, this incredible CD. I hope she reads this review, because I was so taken with her way back then that I wrote a character based on her into my novel, coincidentally published around the same time that this CD was issued. The link is below:Confluence: A NovelJohnnie, I hope you are well and happy and prosperous. This disc deserved to be a big hit.

1	What a surprise!!: Sincerely, I didn't expect a surprise like this. I went to the theater expecting to see a typical entertaining film -I see all the Kevin Spacey's-. When I got out I had that taste in my mouth that only leave the really good films.Magnificent interpretations, a solid script, a good direction and -in occasions- a splendid BGM is all you'll encounter in this film. I won't miss it.Or, at least, that's my opinion...
0	K Pax: Two-thirds of the way through K-PAX I decided that only a great ending was going to redeem this movie. Unfortunately, it ended with a skittering thud and had me muttering "What the huh?" Kevin Spacey and Jeff Bridges are good enough to make their scenes together interesting, but the story is pretty confused. A rental at best.
0	K-KRAP: On the one hand, you've got the nuthouse dramas where the mental patient provides deep truths to inmates and staff alike (Don Juan DeMarco; Cuckoo's Nest). On the other hand, you've got the Taoist alien dispensing generic new-age advice (Starman). Trying to mix the two was a BIG mistake. This movie was way too long, way too slow, too self-involved and overall just dull. Kevin Spacey has done some fantastic work (Seven; American Beauty; Usual Suspects) but this is isn't it. Also, someone said the ending was ambiguous. Not true. Prot is Robert Porter.
1	Since high school...: I have had Dickies pants/shorts on and off since high school. I used to skateboard much more than I do now, and find that these are quite durable. The regular 874 pants have the best fit out of all the other selections available. The only thing I don't like is they attract lint a little too much.
1	Great Value: Pants are comfortable Wash and wear well. I am a truck driver and I get very dirty and a lot of things to get caught on. These pant are performing well .
1	Comfort Fit Here.: I bought these Dickies work pants , we used to call them "chinos" in the1950s,don't ask me why.Ok so they are comfortable and light to wear not heavy canvas pants which is what "bluejeans" really. You walk around in heavy canvas pants or dungarees and wonder why your legs get tired so easy! DA! Anyway I woke up and now I will wear light workpants like Dickies and relax. I do recommend these to anyone .
1	The First Iron lady?: This is an excellent book and a lively and interesting read. Anne Somerset gives an insight into all sides of the character of Elizabeth. Her moods and feelings, (she was renowned at the time for her short temper), both as a woman and a Queen.The glamour of the Tudor court and what it was like to be in or out of favour in a clique where a careless word could in some cases cost you your life.Elizabeth did not suffer fools gladly and the book examines her religious feelings, her sexuality and the way she dealt with conflicts both at home and abroad in what was essentially a man's world. Elizabeth was nobody's fool and although she would listen to her advisers, she had a mind of her own, shrewd and extremely intelligent, and was quite capable of using her authority as monarch to make important decisions for herself.The book is a delight for anyone with the slightest interest in history.
0	Poor: No good... as bad as the Curse of the Pink Panther..... unwatchable!Frankly there is only one Peter Sellers and no doubles can compare just as there is only one Herbert Lom without whom there is no Pink Panther either! If you are a fan get the S.Martin remake, it is rather good and Dryfus is well defined. But do SKIP this one!
1	yeah: french rap at its best! i love it, great beats, excellent lyrics, dope features, every euro worth ;-))
0	Quit with the ads on the clips already!: WANTED to watch the behind the scenes Jailhouse Rock clip but unfortunately Amazon feels the need to ruin it by peddling Elvis product with the damn pop ups thru the whole thing. Maybe if I could actually enjoy the clip I might buy the dvd. Just because of the annoyance factor I am not. You suck Amazon
0	Speedway: Okay here is my opinion. One of my favorite actors in the whole universe is Bill Bixby. If Bill had not been in this movie, I would've gave it1 star. I have respect for Elvis as a singer but he could not act worth a lick! This is another typical Elvis movie, that you just sit through it and by the end of it you think to yourself that you have spent 50 years watching this movie. I think that what makes me like it a bit is because of Bill Bixby being in it.Jenny
0	Hurts my teeth: These were way too strong for my teeth. I used them as directed and towards the end less than directed. They gave me long term pain in my teeth(about a years worth).
1	Crest Whitestrips: Excellent product.. More comments on whiter teeth and nicer smile than i've ever had in my life ! Most everyone noticed w/out even a prompted question to them.
1	amazing product: years ago when the original whitestrips first came out, i tried them. i had great results and the whitening actually lasted longer than i had expected. fastforward a handful of years and i have decided to try the premium strips. i'm getting braces in a month, and i wanted quick results that would last at least through a portion of my treatment. i used the premium strips for 30mins lastnight and i had amazing results from only one strip! if my teeth keep whitening like this, i will have to stop using them before the box is done to prevent having the unnatural 'hollywood glow'. i was blown away!
0	These do NOT work...I promise!: These do NOT whiten teeth. I've tried them and the commercials are deceiving. You will NOT get the results they show on the commercials. I was very disappointed in this product.Save the money from these and go to the dentist and have a professional zoom whitening. There is no way you are going to whiten your teeth at home using these. The peroxide isn't strong enough. The dentist uses over twice the strength of these. I don't care how many packages of these you use, it will not work.Also...The bottom strips are too small to cover your teeth and they float off in your saliva. You're basically ingesting peroxide from them. I don't know how safe that could be, but it's not very promising to me. The dentist will cost more, but it will be what you are really expecting. Save your money.
0	Formatting makes this book hard to read: I was excited to read this free book until I received it.Unfortunately there is no table of contents.Some of the punctuation is different from the original. This is distracting and slows the pace of the book.Everything runs together. The entire book from the preface to the end reads like one chapter without a break.
1	Now I know why it is such a favorite.: I was an English Lit. major, and never a big fan of Dickens. He is too long winded. But this book seemed too short. It's not that I felt that it was incomplete. I just enjoyed it so much that I wanted more.Do yourself a favor, and read it at christmas time. I did.
0	Wasnt what I expected: My family has a history of Dyslexia, so comic books are hard to read. So when my mother told me that had a Christmas Carol, Batman classic for sale, I was thrilled. Needless to say, there was no Batman and I wasted my time and money wondering when we were going to see the caped crusader kicking ebeneezers arse.
1	Short & To The Point !: Dover Thrift Editions of Charles Dickens Christmas Classic, "A Christmas Carol" is short and to the point. My kind of book. The world over knows the premise of Dickens classic but (especially) at this time of year is a story most people will enjoy reading again. The slim 68 pages makes it possible to share this story with a love one in less than an hour. Puts even the most hateful love one in the holiday spirit.
0	Poorly done e-book: Beware, this edition contains all sorts of unmappable punctuation, resulting in irritating replacement characters appearing in place of every apostrophe.
0	maybe good but definitely NOT the unabridged recording: once again, (OK it does not happen that often, otherwise we would stop trusting Amazon and shopping with them, would'nt we?) the description is not accurate : this version ISBN1569945233, monterey media etc.... is an ADAPTATION of Dicken's novel by the St Charles PLayers, who record it with all due talent and spirit BUT as a play, in an "exciting Radio Theater style" quote, unquote.....
0	A Choppily Abridged Carol: Although the artwork in this book is great, readers should be warned that the text is a heavy-handed abridgement of Charles Dickens's wonderful little novel. It omits far too much of the rich and colorful language of this stirring novelette.
1	Couldn&#65533;t put it down: I think this book should be made compulsory reading in schools. It is defiantly one of the great classics. It is timeless, it is still as good today as the day it was first released. I have read few books that would match up to this one. This book can be read by all ages and by people in all warps off life and can be enjoyed by all. I would recommend this book to any one and hope that all have the satisfaction of reading it.
1	Loving a Christmas Carol: This audio version of A Christmas Carol was great. The narrator's voice(s) were very interesting. It matched right along with the version of the book I used for my English class. We enjoyed the story and enjoyed the narrator's classic telling of this classic story.
1	It was a good book and a short book too: It was a good book I finished it in 3 days it was very very very short and I loved the movie
1	A dickens of a story: I had seen various movie versions, and knew the story well. However it was fun just to read Dickens original .
1	Excellent classic: It was great to read this classic once again. Read it years ago and forgot how great especially around the holidays
1	Great classic: Very well developed characters and fabulous description make Mr. Dickens such a great writer. Well worth the time on a cold winter night.
1	Vocabulary: The only thin I had trouble with us the language and vocabulary. Other than that it's a very good Christmas story
1	well written: yes, you already know the story. if you have ever seen any of the infinite number of movies made about this story any time in the last112 years you all ready know what happens. so, why read the book? why? because it is written humorously and beautifully. the characters are written so well that you can relate to all of them and feel acutely what ever the writer wants you to feel toward them. it is also one of Dicken's shorter reads.
1	Great edition of A Christmas Carol: Love Robert Ingpen's illustrations - they work so well for this story in particular. As far as I can tell, this is not abridged either which is a huge plus. If you want an edition of A Christmas Carol on your shelf, this is definitely a good one.
1	The book showed true family values.: I liked Charles Dickens, The Christmas Carol, because it had lots of class. Dickens wrote about something and now you read it to your grandchildren on Christmas Eve. It's something that the whole family will enjoy. I know my family does.
1	Holiday classic: This is a good lesson learned book and brings to mind in reading the importance of sharing with joy. All should learn from this book s message.
1	a holiday classic: A good read for the Christmas holidays. A little wordy at times though but that's expected with the period it was written in. It definitely gives you a glimpse into19th century London and how tough life was.
1	Always a good read!: As fun to read as to watch! While not the true Christmas story, it certainly captures the spirit of Christmas and the effects of living one's Christmas faith in the incarnate Lord Jesus.
1	Not as great as the other seasons. Still missing Dana... it was great seeing her "ghost" in one episode!: I find that the 4th season was not as good as the previous ones. I love all the characters but I did not like Shane moving on so quickly with Paige. She seem to be more the person that Carmen wanted but without Carmen.
0	TOTAL WASTE OF TIME: IT'S NOT OFTEN THAT I DIAMETRICALLY OPPOSE ANOTHER PERSON'S OPINION BUT I THOUGHT THIS BOOK WAS TERRIBLE. I READ ABOUT100 PAGES AND TOSSED IT. THE WRITING IS VERY STILTED AND ITS JUST NOT A COMFORTABLE READ. HEROINE AGGIE IS SO FULL OF START THAT SHE'S JUST NO LIKEABLE, EVEN IN THE LOVE SCENES.....
0	Worst -- Macbeth -- Ever!: First, you can watch this train wreck for free through Google video.Second, find it and watch the ending just so you see Brett's ridiculous Macbeth costume. His tights look like cheap, ill-fitting long underwear with the crotch almost down to his knees. This is during the final scenes where he spits death in the eye, so it's pretty hysterical. With the fakey swords being waved around it brings to mind children horsing around in the backyard.
0	Too much 'Method' in this madness: Method actress Piper Laurie made me laugh out loud when she began the "Come you spirits" speech as if she were trying to summon Blanche DuBois and Medea in one go. Can't imagine Mr. Brett's excuse for as abysmally poor acting. For even worse Shakespearean acting (and yes, it's not the same as playing any other texts) see two Star Trekkers (Ohura and the Russian guy) and a General Hospital star (Luke) in this series' "Antony and Cleopatra". Not a larfing matter in the end.
1	Book - A Sailors' Valentine by John Fondas - great purchase!: I was thrilled to finally receive my book The Sailors' Valentine. It's a unique book about an old art using shells. The sailors of a century and more ago created the Valentines for their sweethearts. The pictures are fantastic and the octagon shape of the book makes it a perfect table book. I could not find this out-of-print book anywhere but on Amazon.com. I received it in it's original sealed box: it was new listed in the used book section. Thanks, Amazon!
0	One star may be too much. Hack writing at its laziest.: Seriously, I cannot fathom that people gush over this book.Essentially, what IDENTITY CRISIS was supposed to be was a 'whodunnit' for the DC Universe stable of characters. However, in a world of telepaths, sorcerers and men who shoot laser beams out of their eyes it falls embarrassingly flat on its face. Meltzer composes a story full of plot holes, bad characterization, and enough tired cliches to make any true fan of the genre wince.Quite possibly the only good comment I could make is that the artist is quite talented... other than that, not a lot to recommend.
1	Replacement blades at a reasonable price: These replacement blades worked great when I needed to repair my AlienFly after flying it into the wall too many times!
1	Good read and easy to understand: This book doesn't contain mathematical formula which is a plus for me!The explanation on how a statistic can be misunderstood or misrepresent in simple English.It is helpful because I can spot more loopholes in statistics now.On the other hand, if a need arises. I can use these methods to mislead people!
0	Tiesto your mix and track selection is bad !!!: I seriously don't think this cd deserves the avg rating it has got. This has got to be the "worst" in search of sunrise series by the `so called #1 dj' Tiesto...The very first song when crossfading with the second is patchy ...which means he cant get the basics right of beat matching. He could have at least perfected it in the studio before the release. (Im sure everyone who bought the cd agrees). Also there is no proper direction in the music. The tunes are not catchy...they are really boring...and sounds like someone is learning to play the keyboard (except Coca & Villa - La Noche), even the vocal tunes here are horrible.Tiesto has lost my vote for the top dj poll (paul van dyk was always #1 for me and will always be)I regret buying this CD. And am depressed with the current state of trance music. Only Paul Van Dyk can cure me with his Politics of Dancing 2 CD.
1	It's first European trip was a success!Q: We bought this product as a gift for our friends to assist them in their 40th anniversary trip to Europe. In their return, one of the first things they said was "how practical and how useful" their GPS was in Europe, especially in England.Apparently, at practicality and ease of use departments it beat the in-dash product that came with their luxury automobile.Sounds like we picked the right product for the right purpose...
0	Beware of cost of updates - opnly one free update offered: I purhcased the nuvi 670 from Amazon several weeks ago and I was hapy with the unit until I checked to see if there were map updates avaialable from Garmin. Garmin's website stated that map updates were available for Europe and North America, but only one update was free. So I spent all this money on a International GPS unit only to end up with one map being out of date. When I received the unit it had a 2006 maps for Europe and 2008 maps fo North America. There were updated versions of both maps available, but I would have to pay for one of them - the cheap one costing close to $70USD. I contacted Garmin on several different occasions and they stood by their policy of only offering one free map update. What a disappointment with this supposively good company. You buy a GPS and it doesn't even come with the latest maps. I am very disappointed.Ron
1	A Lot for the Money: Since the 670 is a discontinued model the price reduction on Amazon was tremendous. For less than $320 you get the following features- Spoken street names (although they often indistinguishable via computerized voices)- Bluetooth cell phone reception (with a bluetooth phone which works very well)- FM traffic monitor (of limited usefulness)- US/Canada & European maps (relative up to date; for the latest maps you get one updated map free and the other must be purchased)- Car & a separate home recharger- Front Window mount- Close to 6 million POI's- Car/Truck/Motorcylce/Walking modes- One way point before end destination- Old style flip antenna (instead of built in)- Very bright screen- Speaker could be louder-I took the unit on a recent trip and it was at least 90% accurate with recent (within the year) roads and freeways often not given. Highly recommended.
1	Garmin nuvi 670 review: I've had a Garmin Quest for many years and have used it throughout the U.S. and Europe on many trips. I bought the Nuvi 670 for my other cars. It has improved antenna sensitivity to work better in a city environment, pre-loaded U.S. and European maps, clearer and enhanced voice instructions as well as blue tooth and other features make this a really enjoyable and useful product.
1	You can never go wrong with Bugs and Company: Having grown up with Bugs Bunny I am pleased to see they are still going. My son laughs out loud when we watch it.
1	Excellent Book for Practice!: When I purchased this book, I hoped that it would help me improve my SAT score. It has helped my improve my score, but lacked some of the tricks that I had expected to find in it. This book offers a great amount of practice problems and excellent explanations, but it gives very little information about some of the test taking tips that other books give. So, if you're looking for a book that gives you a lot of practice with verbal problems, this books is excellent. However, if you hope to find tricks of the trade in this book, look somewhere else because this book gives very minimal.
1	Clear Structure, Good Vocab List: The vocabulary list contained in this book goes on for 90 pages, and contains about 2500 words. Since last month, I have taken the challenge to memorize them all. Everyday, I also took one of the 30 or so question sets (10 analogy,10 fill-in,10 reading). By now, I am 2/3 of the way finished. This contributed greatly to the increase of my verbal score to 750 (from 650) on the practice SAT test.Besides, I also have "hot words for SAT1", and the Barron's guide. This is because one book does not offer enough practices. Getting a couple books is also advantagous because the varying teaching styles makes the task of memorization less monotonous.
0	Skip it!: I bought this for my daughter to try. Her hair is thin and about 2" past her shoulders. while using our regualr shampoo & conditioner, her hair was easily mangeable and looked and felt healthy.AFter using Mane n' tail, her hair felt thicker, dry, and tangled very easily. Working with her hair after using this shampoo was hard. I took her into the barber shop for a trim & the beautician commented on how dry her hair was.

0	A terrible destruction of beautiful music by a great compose: Being that I was born in a latin american country, listening to these tunes (original versions)I can safely say that Mr. Veloso's representation of them are the weakest that I have ever had the mispleasure of listening, and I am a great admirer of Mr. Veloso's works in his native "portuguese" .

0	New battery behaves like used one: I bought a new battery but it is behaving like a used battery. The battery live does not last more than 2 days when not in use.
0	Not OEM product: Given the variance in reviews, at best, I'd say this is an unreliable product. (I saw the mixed reviews before ordering, but figured "they couldn't be that bad.")First of all, the battery was NOT a BB battery -- not as pictured nor made in Japan (it was plain silver and made in China).The battery I received wouldn't hold a charge for more than a couple of hours. I sent an e-mail complaint; was told that sometimes a given battery won't be up to snuff; and they would exchange. The second battery lasted a little longer but not even 24 hours. I gave up. I had made a bad bet. I just didn't want to bother with them any more. I used it for a couple of months -- having to charge it once or twice a day. It declined steadily and finally flat-lined this week. Ironically, I'm now using my old battery which seems brilliant compared to my recent experiences.Maybe you'll get lucky, but the odds are against you.
0	8830 Battery: I did not do a scientific study, but I don't think the new battery that I received holds more or longer charge than my worn out 31/2 year old battery. When I got the battery it looked a bit beat. I called and they assured me that it is new. The person said that the batteries ship bulk in a bag and they get beat up. I'm not thrilled with the performance. I am skeptical and will not do it again. Cannot recommend it.
0	rating the actual book, not its wonderful content: This huge, collector's edition is HEAVY, the font is small, and there is a ridiculous amount of margin area for writing. I take copious notes, but this is even too much for me. So in effect, you buy this supposedly beautifuly collector's edition, but it's shiny paper back - what's so great about it? Nothing. I'm not even sure why it costs so much. I've seen numerous errors in spelling. The value doesn't equal what you pay for it. Go for the lighter editions, unless, like other reviewers, you buy this merely to sit on your shelf to impress people (or yourself).As for the book, Adam Smith is thorough, it's hard work to get through it, but his principles are sound and when left to work without government regulation, the precepts taught therein work beautifully. Smith gets five stars. The Premium Edition is lucky to get two.
0	Bad Edition: I would not buy this edition. The printing is terribly small. Its about half the size of normal print. And there is no introduction. Usually these types of works have some sort of preface which introduces the reader to the material.
0	Beware: NO 5th BOOK!: The Everyman's Library version is abridged -- without being advertised as so, either on Amazon OR anywhere inside the book!The Wealth of Nations is a pivotal work in the history of economics and human nature, but you'd be better off finding an edition that includes the entire work.The Wealth of Nations (Everyman's Library)
1	Essential Reading: This is in my top 5 best books of all time. I give it an A+. It is a very long read that covers a broad range of information involving economics, but well worth the time spent. There are a lot of references to issues that were occurring during Smith's time that may not seem to be pertinent to the reader, but can still be applied to modern times. I most enjoyed the last sections of the book on taxes and public debts. His 4 maxims of taxes are that they should be- equal, certain, convenient, and beneficial. He viewed inflation as "extremely pernicious". The book contains ideas that Americans should possibly revisit in the near future.
0	Smokey and the Bandit Pursuit Pack: The quality of this 3 movie DVD was terrible. The first movie froze up near the end even after I attempted to play it in a second player. The 2nd movie didn't play at all and the third one, which played perfectly, was a waste of time.The original Smokey and the Bandit was true comedy genius and Jackie Gleason's portrayal of Sheriff Buford T. Justice was one of his very best. Burt Reynolds, Sally Field and Jerry Reed were dynamite together and Jerry Reed's "East Bound and Down" song topped a great comedy. Its too bad the 2nd movie didn't play, because I thought this one was nearly as good as the first. The 3rd installment lacked good writing and seemed just plain empty without Burt Reynolds and Sally Field.Smokey and the Bandit: Pursuit Pack
1	Burt Reynolds: It came very fast and the quality is very good, would buy from this seller again if they anything that I want. Thanks
0	Diehard fans wondering about the B-side???: Well, if you missed this import single when it was released along with a handful more, you may fear you missed an Andy Bell gem. This track is a B-side for a reason. Totally inferior to anything on the full length CD. No, it's not an electro house dance track like much of what you'll find on the full length. It's a short, sort of campy cabaret style track that uses what sounds like a real band, including acoustic drums, guitar, and even a horn section. If you simply MUST have everything Andy Bell sings, then you do get plenty of his vocal, but if you're really more just about his classic dance sound, then pass on it. Ashame they couldn't have just thrown it in as a bonus track on the domestic maxi-single release of Crazy.
0	Incorrect advertisement: You have an advertisement to use the Olympus B-50SU 4 AA NiMH Batteries and charger with the DSC-U10 camera. The DSC-U10 camera uses AAA batteries not AA. Do you have a AAA NiMH battery and charger for the DSC-U10 camera ??? I guess I can use the B-50SU charger for other things that need AA batteries. Please correct your advertisement.
1	Old School Action Movie: I agree with the other reviewers that this is an entertaining action movie as long as your suspend MOST of your belief in reality. I do what to point out that the machine gun he shoots is a Browning .30 caliber NOT a .50 caliber. The gun was meant to shot from a tripod, but it COULD be shot from the hip. He DOES run out of bullets for it and his handguns. As for the rocket launcher part...I'm sorry, the explosion/back blast would have killed all three of them in the room when it went off!

1	The masterpiece of American song: Perhaps the best thing to say about this Songbook is what Ira Gershwin said after hearing it. " I did not realize how good our songs( George and Ira Gershwin) were until I heard Ella sing them. In these Songbooks she is at her mature best. Her voice is smooth, elegant, clear , beautifully nuanced, rich in range, remarkable. It is sheer joy to listen to her in the very best of the songs. While many prefer the drive and rhythm of Ellington I myself prefer the more lyrical and slower swinging pieces. But what is important is that this is a great Masterpiece which presents the great works of the American Songook in the best way possible.One can listen to these songs again and again , and doing so brings only greater pleasure.
1	Where struggle ends and grace begins: I first read this book when I had to write an existential paper for one of my counseling classes. It was difficult for me to understand at first, but I read it again, and it changed my life in ways. So many times, we look at God and box him/her into compartments. When we do this, we think we have a good handle on who and what God is. Then as time goes on, and we evolve, our thoughts on God no longer relate or apply to our lives. Through the struggle to know, seek and experience God, we many times are disappointed when God and ourselves do not connect. Paul Tillich tells us that through the struggle, we must have absolute faith, and the god who is really God appears in Grace.
0	Piece of Crap: I bought this radio because my last one that I bought in 6 dollars from walmart was broken from its antena and now it could play channels but there was static most of the time. I was too excited about new radio . I got my radio yesterday and it was biggest disapointment for me. This radio had more static than the broken one I had. none of SW cannel is working they are there just for show. None of these channels is clear enough that you can understand something. I will suggest either get some radio that can only work with AM/FM but have clear sound or spend more money and get something that works

1	It doesn't really do it: This work has much interesting information but I do not think it truly defines the 'Jewish Mind'. I have the sense that the Jewish Mind if we consider its creations from Biblical Time to now is simply too vast and varied for easy definition. I would too say that as Jews value the idea of Creation , their own Mind is in a constant process of Development and creation. Any summary then seems to be a simple reduction, and not true to the Reality.
0	Details, Details, Details!!: I did not care for this book at all. It was all detail and description. The excitement of the book isn't until the very end and even that wasn't so great. The only part of the book I enjoyed was the subtle way that Marian had feelings for Shane because she was so fascinated by him. Otherwise I couldn't wait until it was over so I could write my paper and get it over with.
1	This book has potential: Ok, I am kind of stuck. I am trying to find the real meaning of "Shane", but with no avail. I KNOW there is a meaning, all the adults talk about it...but what is it? And, what are all the 'little' meanings (ex. What is the meaning of the stump? Does it show that Joe and Shane work well together?) PLEASE help me! email me or something. I am in 8th Grade and I just got done with the book. help.
1	A Decent, Well-Acted, 45-Minute Movie: I had seen this movie on TV way back in1991 on a local PBS station. I hadn't seen it since then. So when I got this DVD recently, I was really looking forward to seeing it again. I remembered how well-acted this movie was.It is a very good movie. However, I noticed that some of the dialogue seemed a little "forced" in certain parts. You could tell that the actors were "reading" scripted lines. This only happened in a couple places. Other than that, all the other dialogue was rendered in a natural and effective way.This movie is quite sad, and the actors really bring that across. You can sense their pain and hurt as they work through the anguish of Andre's death.This is a very good movie (and very short). Well worth the investment!
1	Good fun, though not the strongest in the series: More good fun from Chester Himes. On the plus side, he finally includes some entertaining sex. On the other hand, one of the main bad guys here (the "Colonel") is particularly flat and unbelievable. Also, as usual, the end is much less satisfying than the ride to get there.
1	Attractive and expensive looking, but great price.: I was very please with how well made these rings are. They were very cheap compared to everything else out there, so I was prepared for shoddy quality, but that's not what came. They are really well finished.
1	Good value, unique ... but watch your measurements.: I ordered this item hopeful that it would fit my rods. However, as others have mentioned, the dimensions are not truly 2" ... likely best for a1" rod. Anything over that just doesn't work.Regrettably, this item was returned.
1	good for the price: I bought this so my son could have a pocket to stash his car stuff in. So far so good. The price was good.
0	can't see it: i have an ipad and a local wifi. i couldn't see the movie as a cloud. i downloaded but each time i tried to see it i received the same message: htttp....... so the movie remains on my ipad unviewed. I would give it a higher rating if i could at least see it.
1	Great live CD: As one other reviewer mentioned finding great live CD's from new wave bands is very difficult. I'm usually not a fan of live CD's but I really enjoy this one. Autumnal Park is one of my all-time favorite new wave albums and I am excited that I get to continue to listen to it live.
0	very disappointed: emailed this company to find out if this was an "antique" book, but received absolutely no response except that the book arrived and it's new; very disappointed and dont recommend doing business w/them
0	not worth the money: After reading the editors note on this book one is lead to believe that this book will give you information on19-century photography. You are lead to believe that a wealth of information is on hand, but it is note. In fact very little is shown concerning photography, and almost nothing at all concerning the cameras. In short this book is trash, and not worth the money, or the paper it is printed on!
0	Relaxing Music?: I was hoping to find some nice calming, relaxing music to play in my classroom and home. This was a little too instrumentally loud.
1	great product: even though it was damaged in shipping this charger works great and i would recomend it to anyone it charges fast and since it has a fan it does not over heat like most chargers
1	Hex Wrenches: I have used this brand previously at work and have had good luck with them. The coating holds up to daily use and abuse.
1	Best film about art and the artist ever: I try to watch this movie once a year. It is a gorgeous, slow moving thing. The better part of the movie is taken up with the battle between Frehofer and the form he is trying to bring to life on the canvas, with Emmanuelle Beart as his model. He gives up... she gives up... but they plow on through. The story is unsullied by any erotic (or at least, overtly erotic) connection between the two. But there is none of the neurotic histrionics and unrequited sacrifices of the usual films about artist: there is just the hard, greuling, work of having a vision and getting it right.This is freely based on the story "The Unknown Masterpiece" by Balzac. If only more movies "freely based" on a story could be as fine as this one. Knowing the story, which is a short novella, may actually add to the appreciation of the film and the character of Frenhofer.
1	Mish: This is a hilarious album with all the favourite aspects of the Prairie Home Companion show. Garrison Keillor could read the phone book and it would be funny.
1	Garrison Keillor . . . need anyone say more?: It's a full hour of A Prairie Home Companion, not just the best bits from various shows. The version of the small church's struggle to find a musical director seems different from the one I have on another CD, but it's all delightful. Great way to spend an hour while driving in the country. WARNING: do not attempt to operate vehicle in town or under complicated road conditions while listening to any PHC CD. These require some brainwork, and I've almost driven off the road laughing a couple of times.
1	All of the books in this series are excellent!: The lessons in the books of this series are classic,timeless and very much needed at this time. I wish every parent would read them to their children.
1	An Old Favorite: I fondly remember this book that I read as a child over fifty years ago. I was looking for a way to address issues about manners with my five year old grandson and rediscovered this book. He clearly got the messages Leaf imparted and thoroughly enjoyed it. The author did an excellent job of succicntly and imaginatively presenting the rules of getting along with others and the consequences of not doing so. The terminology and pictures Leaf used to describe poorly mannered children was indelibly printed in my mind and has lost none of its charm.
0	HELP ME!: Oh my gosh. I f you are looking for an interesting book to read. Don't read Treasure Island. It is totally on a reading level for way older people. Not 7th graders. I had to read this book in class and it was so hard to understand that I gave up and fell asleep. Boring Book. I wouldn't even classify it as a classic. I would classify it as a good way to put yourself to sleep.
1	Stevenson's Best!: This book is the best book i have ever read! i have already read this book 5 times and i will read it much more in my lifetime. Stevenson blends adventure and intrigue splendidly in this fast paced novel about a young boy who receives a treasure map from an old buccaneer, and his adventures afterward. Hawkins, the boy, meets up with salty pirates and finds good friends in the captain and doctor. i would reccomend that anyone who loves a good book and an exciting thrill should definately read this.
1	A treasure: This is an authentic masterpiece by the author of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde, which tells a story of pirates in search of a treasure hidden in an island. Dr Jekyll is very different, a strange, puzzling, mysterious, symbolic story. The characters in Treasure Island are unforgettable, Jim Hawkins, Dr Livesey, captain Smollet, John Silver, the man without a leg who disappears in Latin America and the pirate Flint, a character who is always present, but only through the dialogues. This is a classic, but a cult novel as well.
1	Review of "Treasure Island": Stevenson's "Treasure Island" is remarkably well written, containing fascinating bits of foreshadowing, a unique and captivating plot, and undying characters that will burn into your mind indefinitely.My personal favorite character is Long John Silver, who throughout the novel seems almost schitzofranic. His one side is well-mannered, charming and witty, while his other face is ruthless, sly and money-driven.In Part One, "The Old Buccaneer", the strange new pirate pays Jim Hawkins a gold piece daily "to watch out for a one-legged man hobbling down the street." This is truly good, almost humorous, foreshadowing.The ending is perfectly crafted by Stevenson; it closes with Jim Hawkins describing his predictions for the destinies of the pirates he has traveled with.Thank you, Robert Louis Stevenson, for contributing one of literatures' most amazing works.
1	Treasure Island: I read this year's ago and loved it then. I enjoyed reading it again, wonderful book! This was the first book I read on my kindle, awesome!
1	Treasure Island: I thought that "Treasure Island" was a very good, exciting book and it made me want to read. There were some parts that were not as interesting as others and they needed some excitment and at these parts I didnt think that I was going to like the book, but by the end I didnt want it to be over. I thought it was very exciting how they were on the island with all these pirates and how they were both going after the same thing, the treasue. Adding new characters and taking away some of the old ones,death, was also a part of how it made it interesting. over all it is a very good book and I advise people of all ages to read it
0	Booooooooooorrrrrrrring!!!: I had to read this for a 7th grade class... I got what was happening (mostly), but it was the dumbest story. There was no point and i was about to fall asleep halfway through- Totally boring! Save your time, or if you do get it, DON'T get the old version- the conversations are even harder to understand.
1	First read: Up until this point I had only ever seem Muppet Treasure Island. This book is actually pretty cool, certainly worth reading given that it comes for free with the kindle.
1	Treasure Island: A classic. Everyone should read this book...and all things written by Robert Louis Stevenson. He is one of my favorite authors of all time.
1	treasure island: treasure islandis an awesome book I just couldn't stop turning the pages. Many people died but its still action-packed with thrills.
1	Treasure island: Treasure island is a good classic book that gave me hours of reading enjoyment. All the pirate language made it hard to read sometimes but gave it realism that made it enjoyable.
1	A Great Adventure: I loved this book. I never read this one as a child, but I wish that I had. This book causes the imagination to run wild. I can see Treasure Island in my mind's eye! Well worth the read.
0	Good book, of course, difficult to use audio link.: Bought it because my daughter is reading it in school, and wanted it with the audio link so we could listen in the car. However, we could not figure out how to get the audio link to work.Disappointing.
1	How could I never have read this before?: This book was excellent. I can see why it was considered a classic. I had never read it before and got it because it was free. I will definitely read it again. Lots of action and a great story.
1	Classic: Great read. The writing style may be considered a bit dull by today's standards, but I really liked reading this. This is the original pirate adventure book. Yo ho ho!
1	Works Great: Tripp Lite INTERNET550SER 550VA UPS Compact Low Profile Standby 8 outlets w/ DB9 PortWe have been using our Tripp 550SER since October 2008. It meets our expectations for a great surge and small back up power supply. It would be nice if there were an option to turn off the beep alarm when the standby power is running.This is a great unit.
0	A Total Waste of Money: I've used this battery backup for less then a year and it no longer works. When the power goes off, so does everything plugged into this Tripp Lite battery backup. THEN the battery backup kicks in and starts beeping. Real useful. Total waste of money and could ruin your expensive computer equipment when you think that you are being protected from power surges and outages.

1	moka brew coffee: Bought this product after drinking great coffee in Amsterdam that was pressure brewed,[senseo one cup],and this machine is close but no cigar.The taste from this machine is better than drip machines but not as frothy as the Senseo.Senseo draw-back is buying your coffee in those pods,very expensive.This machine is low pressure,maybe the difference in taste.
1	Good book: This product is pretty good. It lists so many websites available. It is mostly aimed at older homeschoolers, but there are things in it for all ages.
1	The only...: I ordered this book simply to replace the original book that has come unbound from years of use. I've been reading cards for close to 25 years now. My first deck was given to by my mother when I was an adolescent. I've come across many decks over the years, and have yet to find one that compares to the "Old Path". I mostly work with oracle cards now, however I use the tarot for precise information. The Old Path refers to pre-Christian era, when the Goddess was the divine deity. The cards are beyond beautiful and definitely feminine without being feminist. They have a beautiful balance between male and female. The cards relay precise information without being too harsh. These are my tarot for life. BLESSED BE!
1	Rush 2:Better than rush exept for music and tracks.: 22 Cars(including 6 to get from keys, Mountian Dew, and circuits), and better graphics. !Warrning! Bad tracks compared to rush. HEY!!!!! Where's the music that i like?
1	Good Movie!: This is a very old movie but it made a deep impact on me because it's very spiritual. This movie teaches how temptation can be deadly. I always like movies that leave you thinking and this one definitely does that. It's sexual in some parts and in other parts it's exciting and filled with suspense. I love to show this movie to my friends because most of them have never seen it before. I would recommend watching this movie on a dark stormy night. :)
1	Women are pure evil: The demon from hell that looked like a woman is praying on single she meets in bars in New York. Everytime she takes a man home with her while she having sex with them she starts to kill them. It takes a christian boy from the south to stop her evil deads.
0	Didn't like the paper quality and presentation: I bought them (Northanger Abbey, Persuasion, Mansfield Park and Emma) to complete my Jane Austen's collection, and honestly, didn't like the paper quality, it seems like they didn't even care for the presentation of them; it didn't look elegant, cheap to be more specific.
1	Definitley worth a read: Another classic that is definitely worth a read. Its one of those books that is slow in a couple of places but the suspense of the ending - or the expected ending keeps you reading. Oh you just want to go back in time and find your own Captain Wentworth!!
0	Shoddy quality: My review isn't about the story aspect of the book, but rather the physical quality of this edition. It's, well, crap. I don't know what I was expecting, but this wasn't it. As someone else said, it looks cheap. As if this was some new author who had her book printed independently. And the print is miniscule. I never complain about print, but this book is just dreadful. Tiny print and the lines are extremely close together.I'm supposed to be reading this for my book club, but I strongly suspect I'm going to be looking for another edition to use. I suppose I got what I paid for; the quality of this one is just awful.
0	Did not enjoy Persuasion on first read but may re-read: I studied this book in a first year Romantic & Victorian course which I did not enjoy. I found Persuasion difficult to get into and did not enjoy it. I studied an18th Century Fiction course and enjoyed Mansfield Park and other very interesting novels. I did enjoy this course.I'm returning to Austen because I recently purchased Pride & Prejudice and Zombies, and I feel it would be a crime not to read the original first.If I enjoy Pride and Prejudice I might just return to reading Persuasion again, just to see if I find it a much better read.
1	A wonderful novel: Jane Austen is often noted for her earlier works, namely Pride and Prejudice. Her later books are sometimes passed up, yet they can prove to be quite an enjoyable read.Anne Elliot, a wealthy, yet amazingly kind girl, finds herself in love with a penniless gambler who is making his profession as a sea captain. He proposes. She allows her friends to "persuade" her that this poor captain is not the man for her. He leaves, heartbroken, and over time becomes a wealthy man. He returns eight years later and Anne realizes that she never quite got over the man who stole her heart so many years ago. However, Captain Wentworth seems fairly content without her. Her shyness keeps the debonair captain from ever knowing her true feelings, but like any good Austen novel, the good girl always wins. Anne isn't as impetuous as Elizabeth Bennett, but her sweet nature will keep you rooting for her. Read and enjoy!
1	An excellent recording from Naxos and Juliette Stevenson: To be absolutely truthful, Anne Elliot may be too "nice" for you to find her as enjoyable as Emma Woodhouse or Elizabeth Bennett. Don't let that put you off however, this production was a joy! Persuasion is thoughtful and mature, and beautifully brought to life by Juliette Stevenson's reading. Her delightfully modulated voice, switches with ease between characters: she really shines as Anne's annoying sister Mary, you find yourself wishing for more of her! Male characters are believable as men - really, each character is rendered with admirable distinctness and individuality. Naxos' technical recording is of excellent quality as usual, seamless between takes. Jane Austen's keen insight into people's motives and character is piercing as always and her wit at society's expense is as apt today as 200 years ago. I have thoroughly enjoyed this recording and highly recommend it.
1	Love Kindle!: Everything was as expected. Timely delivery, great condition, worked as prescribed. If you question this product or this particular vendor, sleep easy. They are great! Thanks again! -w
0	Not the best: Like all Jane Austin novels, this was very class conscious, overly verbose, and difficult to relate to for a modern audience. It lacked the charm of some of her other books and the story dragged excessively. A long and wordy read, I would recommend reading "Sense & Sensibility" instead.
1	Persuasion: Austen at Her Best: Persuasion is Austen's version of Hans Christian Andersen's "The Ugly Duckling." How does Anne Elliot deal with her "faded bloom?" Throughout the novel, Austen depicts a most sympathetic character, Anne Elliot, that a woman of the1990's can readily identify with. Anne Elliot is pulled in each and every direction as she tries to fit in and find her own self. This is not just another one of Austen's cliched marriage plots. It is a book about learning to cope and evaluating one's culture.
1	Always a pleasure: Watched the movie10 or so times before reading the book. Just finished second reading. The humanity of it is so engaging. Misunderstandings and assumptions abound. People hiding their true feelings and fearful of speaking up. How true in our lives as well, making the outcome even more satisfactory.
0	The tape, I'm afraid, is very bad indeed.: I bought the tape with delight, but found that I can not listen to it. Whatever producers do to reduce the hissing of the 's' sounds, these producers did *not* do.Just the first few minutes of the first side were extremely distracting and irritating. I couldn't imagine the actress - whose voice is really lovely! - talking about the 'ssea' and Lyme Regissssss by the second half of the book.I am sorry to have to say it, but there it is.
0	Doesn't work!: Maybe we just got a bad one, but it doesn't work. The flower barely fits inside the wand (too wide) and gets stuck, and the magnet isn't powerful enough to pull it back out. My son was pretty disappointed with it, luckily it was just a stocking gift!
1	One of my all-time favorites: Listening to these recordings gives one the same feeling as one would have re-reading love letters that have been carefully tucked away. The very best tribute to Ella Fitzgerald there could possibly be ... Tommy brings these beautiful tunes to life with his incredible style of playing. This isn't a recording just for fans of Ella or Tommy ... it's a must-have for anyone who enjoys good, uplifting music.
0	Nice idea - poor quality device, firmware problems: After endless hours with Lingo and Dlink support I give up. There are firmware issues with this device, and Dlink and lingo point fingers at each other.Low volume, dropped calls, and frequent need to reboot the device.If you want lingo, don't use this device, get the standard box they provide.
0	Destroyer is Non-Anamorphic, Send a Message: Pick up the individual Conan the Barbarian SE release, but don't support this lame packaging of that disc with a non-anamorphic release of Conan the Destroyer. I was excited about picking this up, but declined once I realized that Destroyer was not enhanced for widescreen televisions. Would it have killed the studio? What a disappointment.
1	Go Conan!: All of the Conan movies are great, and no one fits the bill better than Arnold ;) There are some scenes in these movies though, that are....exposed....lots of nudity that I had never seen before....but that's ok, I could look at Arnold all day ;)
1	Quality Product: Well built and makes delicious coffee, tea and hot chocolate. Easy to use and loaded with features. Menu is user friendly.
1	My Second Keurig: Liked the first on so much, I bought a second one for the office, now I can enjoy my favority coffee all day.
1	Great for a single guy: Pros:Easy to use.Just the right ammount of coffee.Simple clean up.Good Selection of coffees.Great Customer Support.Cons:Coffee is a little weak, need to use two pods if you want it stongPods can be hard to find and expensive if not ordered from Amazon [...]Broke within two months. (Wouldnt register Pod, went through all the troubleshooting, but 'K' sent out a replacement ASAP and no problems since.This is the perfect at work coffee maker or for someone who's the only coffee drinker at home. Its great for the coffee drinker who values ease of use slightly ahead of taste. The coffee could be a little stronger.Go with the bold stuff even if you like mild coffees!
1	Love, Love, Love my Keurig!: This baby makes a great cup of coffee with no mess, no waiting, and no waste. It couldn't be easier! We are fairly picky about our coffee. We would grind our own and it had to be Eight O'Clock Columbian Roast and fresh. My husband thought a Keurig cup might be a nice occasional stand in for his regular pot, but after trying a wide variety of K cups from the sampler packs, he's found a new coffee that he likes more than his fresh ground Eight O'Clock... Caribou Blend. We also love Newman's Own Organic Special Blend Extra Bold. My kids have been having fun making hot chocolate as well as using just the hot water (hitting brew without adding a K cup) to cook their cup of noodles.
0	Forever Breaking-Have Gone Through @ Already!: I received the Keurig B70 for Christmas. I loved it for a few weeks. Then all the problems arose. I called customer service and had to hold for over an hour. They gave me the run around at first but then offered to ship me a completly new machine. I thought that would be the end of it, however, THE REPLACEMENT MACHINE IS BROKEN NOW TOO! Listed are the problems both machines had:* Both turn off right after brewing a cup, no matter how the settings are.* Both Eventually turn off right after they are turned on.* Second Machine (1 week old) leaves grinds in the cup and brews partial cups. The waterpump is not drawing water.* Now the second machine will not even brew.Have tried everything the manual says-Nothing is working!Now I am stuck with two broken (expensive) machines that WILL NOT WORK! I am on hold now with Keurig for the 9th time holding over 40 minutes now.DO Not Buy Until they fix the TERRIBLE glitches in this machine!
0	Stopped working properly after1 week: I loved the machine itself but after approx one week it started to brew a 4 oz cup of copy using the 7.25 cup size. In addition, every other cup was luke warm at best. If it worked as it was intended I would recommend it highly but instead I am extremely dissappointed at the poor quality of the product..
1	best b-70: this is my second one B-70 for the money is the best brewing system delivery was fast and free
1	Keurig B70 Platinum: Great delivery service and terrific price! This arrived right before Christmas as gift for my husband. We both are enjoying the coffee maker. We can pick our own coffee choices. It works great. We both love it!!!
1	This was gift: I bought this last Christmas for my Daughter and Son in law, Replacing the old one they had. they are thoroughly enjoying it.
0	Dont waist your time or $$: My in-laws got me this machine as a new house warming gift. I was so excited!! Then it only worked for 3 days. They took it back to costco and ordered me another one (same maching) here on Amazon. Got the Keurig B70 Platinum Brewing System on Friday, and today is Sunday and it will not brew a cup. It is like the water is not getting pushed threw to the 'down spout'. Same problem as the last machine that only lasted 3 days as well. I totally thought i had to be a fluke! But i will not be getting the same machine for a 3rd time. Sad, without coffee!!!
0	Price is rediculous..: Costco has the same machine for $145 with 60 k-cups... Just rediculous.. Starting to sigh on amazon.... Prices this season have been jacked sky high...
0	What is the opposite of Green?: In a world where we have floating islands of plastic. How does this type of product even get patented, let alone sold and popular? Each cup of coffee, tea, hot chocolate, has a plastic cup that, you guessed it, gets sent to the land fill.I have seen these becoming more popular, instead of doing away with such a trash producer, like I would love to believe this world is moving towards.There must be a better greener way to make coffee! Please don't buy this!I can't give it a star, I wish there were negative stars. (I guess I have to give it one, because it won't let me post without)
1	LOVE IT!: I absolutely LOVE this coffee maker. I am a new mother working full time and I can't survive the day without coffee in the morning. My daughter just turned 5 months old and I have learned that I must simplify my daily routine wherever possible. This coffee maker is so convenient it has changed my mornings and there is no preparation needed the night before. Just refill with water every few days and it's always ready to go. LOVE IT!
1	Review: Product was shipped on time and arrived as advertised - all works great ......... we were worried initially with the coffee maker as the first few cups of coffee had a metallic taste, but after cycling water thru a few times it tasted normal. We love the coffee maker - very convenient. Glad we purchased the larger model with a bigger tank of water - would have taken too many refills with a smaller capacity tank....... wish there would have been a non-commercial product line that had an option to connect to a water line.We love the little individual cups of coffee and the variety. I have found that it's easy to cut the top off the used cup, wash it out and put any brand coffee in it. Then I cover with a round piece of aluminum foil as a cap - works great........ a lot better than the individual cup holder we purchased........ only trick is to line up the puncture hole on bottom when inserting the cup in the holder.
1	WOW - MUCH BETTER THAN THE B60!!!: I purchased the B60 about a month ago and was relativley pleased at the ease and convenience of it. I no longer had to make a pot (or1/2 a pot) of coffee wondering if my husband was going to have any that particular morning or not. And then measuring, cleaning and throwing away...etc. Just a pain with a house full of kids running around so early in the morning! But I recognized that I had to brew at the smaller of the 2 sizes with an extra bold coffee to get close to what I liked. THEN, we received an early holiday gift this morning, and lo and behold, the B70!!! Right out of the box and at the 3rd cup size (which is 9.25 oz.) the taste was AMAZING! And actually a bit stronger than the smaller sized cup from the B60. I'm not sure if it brews it a few seconds slower, but all-in-all definitely worth the extra $50 or so for this model over the B60. I wish I had bought this model in the1st place!
0	Worst coffee maker: I bought the keurig about 2 years ago and without fail the company has had to send me a new one every 6 months. The brewer works great for about1 to 2 months and then goes down hill from there. Read all the reviews, look at the time frame the people have owned them! The good reviews are from the people who have owned them for 2 months or less! They have sent me 4....thats right 4!!!! replacement brewers and all do the same thing! Customer service has to go through the same process every time, I think I know them by name now. They defend this piece of junk and the bad ratings by saying they sell so many of them that they have to expect some problems....really....YOU ARE CHARGING $160 BUCKS!!!!! This brewer is a piece of crap....look at the Hamilton Beach instead....SignedKeurig Sucks!
0	It's not working well.: We were very pleased with the B-70 for about l1/2 years. But now it is failing. We did all the suggested fixes but it is still giving us problems. Called Keurig and they said we will sell you another one for $117.00. Don't know if I want to buy another one if it is going to go bad like the last one.
0	NOT worth it - tons of problems: I am so upset about my coffee maker. I received it for a gift in12/09 and for the last six months, it has randomly shut off, made inconsistent sized cups of coffee, and required me to become very creative with how I get my morning cup of coffee. I have descaled, I use bottled water and I have cleared the pin on so many occasions - I feel like a Keurig repair man. Nothing is worse than having to scream for your coffee in the wee hours of the morning. I had high hopes and the quality is sub-par for such an expensive coffee maker. The web is filled with discussion boards of the same complains and it is my understanding that Keurig is "surprised" with every phone call to their customer service. Wish I could recommend the machine (as I did to many people when I first got it) but it is NOT a good purchase. Lasts about six months on average from what I read on the web.
0	Platinum series is terrible: Bought a platinum series brewer. Wish I had never done so. Have to keep constantly unplugging and restarting to get it to work correctly. Piece of junk
1	Christmas Present: I bought this coffee pot for my daughter as a christmas/birthday present. She wanted it because they had one at work and loved it. She said the one I got her was even nicer then the one at work.
0	Unreliable and Unpredicatable.: This product is unrellibale and unpredictable. Multiple problems; makes a full cup intermittently. You never know when you get a full cup or a half cup. It also deposits coffee rinds in the cup of coffee, intermittently. Lastly after using this product for about10 days, it stopped working. The word Prime displayed on the screen, and followed manufacturer's recommended guidelines to correct, which it did for about 3 cups and then stopped working. The only thing that works; it makes noise like a constant motor running and would not shut off, nor does it make coffee. Don't buy this piece of junk.
0	What's the point? Long term revenue.: I recently experienced one of these appliances at my office where I was really impressed. Although we had to purchase our own K-Cups they ended up being relatively inexpensive ($.44/Kup) for the price of convenience. And so, I decided to purchase one for home. Then the problem started... K-cup prices skyrocketed... DOUBLING on Amazon to about $.90/Kup. I'm a sucker. I really wish I would have returned it. But I am far beyond the Amazon 30-day return policy. And so, the Keurig has been tossed into the garage sale pile.However, our Keurig has proved to be invaluable when anyone in the house is sick with the flu. Chicken broth, tea, and even Theraflu is effortless. If you have a home where this scenario is common, this appliance is perfect. But, the cost of the Kups are way to high for this to be any value.
1	Keurig B70 Coffee System: I am so happy with my Keurig B70 Platinum Coffee system. I am mostly impressed with the easiness of it's use, and the quality and reproducibility of each and every cup of coffee I make. I highly recommend that every household have one.
1	Wonderful: Very happy with this purchase. Easy enough to set up. I really like being able to set the beverage temperature. I like the highest setting at192-degrees for my beverages, but others in my family don't, and they are able to have "cooler" hot coffee.
0	Yes it's short-cupping: Well, now we are a little leery about replacing, but we have invested in about 5 boxes of K-cups (taking advantage of sales at Kohl's) soo..this is going back to Costco tomorrow. We read the reviews but thought that the newer models had replaced the older ones-guess not. We had been using bottled water entire time so we knew in 2 months it wasn't a build up issue. It's short-cupping and going back.
1	Keurig B70: I am very pleased with my Keurig B70. It easy and fast to use. I love the different varieties of coffee and tea offered. I now can enjoy a cup of coffee or tea anytime during the day without the hassles of a conventional coffee maker and so I do. I do miss it when out of town. I am considering getting one for my small office staff so they and I can enjoy it at work.
1	Wait for Product: Had to wait 6 weeks from Amazon for this brewer. Then the order was finally cancelled so I bought it from JR and got it in three days.
0	returned: I returned it. It was broken when I received it. I was very unhappy with the return process trying to get a return # was very difficult and felt like I was imposing on the staff. I have bought many things on the site and have never had to return anything. I ended up getting one from the Keurig web site (of couse it cost a little bit more). Your welcome to call me on my cell @ 520-820-2790.
1	brewer is very stylish: Let me say this brewer is very stylish, extremely simple to use, and has bare minimal clean up however, the coffee does not have any richness or flavor. It is very watered down.
0	I CANT BELIEVE I ACTUALLY TOOK THE TIME TO READ THIS BOOK!!!!!!!!!!!!!: I must say that I absolutely hated this story. I describe this book with three words and these words are...pointless and confusing. Trick of the Eye is extremely slow for the first 80 pages and then after that the story gets so mixed up and confusing that you can't understand it. This book was so confusing I don't even know what the story is really about. And as and ending note, I would like to say that the first 80 pages could have been written in eight!!
1	What a cool album...: Mark Isham has a gift for capturing, even setting, moods. His pieces evoke feelings and moods. Not quite background music but not quite music you actively listen to, his music allows parts of us to arise, giving us pause to reflect, to wander, to dream.This is the soundtrack for a great movie but the soundtrack stands on its own. It is exploratory and adventurous. There are several jazz/blues numbers on it but there is also some experimental music that is difficult to categorize. It is at once entrancing yet challening. That may sound a bit technical but the one word that describes the whole thing is 'cool', as in the jazz kind of cool.There aren't many like this one to find. That's what makes it so good. If you are looking for some creative and different music, this is a great place to wander.
1	Plano Four Handgun Case: All I can say is WOW! These are some pretty big hangun cases! For the price, these cases will do the trick. Also, keep in mind that you get what you pay for. The hinges are completely plastic so if the cases need to last for a while be sure to take precautions by NOT overloading, stacking, or excessive opening & closing. They will fit 4 semi- autos or 2 large framed revolvers comfortably. I will not advise putting more than two semi-autos on the same level. And, only one large framed revolver on one level because shifting does occur (although minimal) to avoid scratching or scraping metal surfaces. There is a space for a padlock! And, the foam is durable and safe for all handgun finishes. If you need a handgun case for multiple firearms, I recommend this product. If you have a special firearm with lots of accessories or bulky parts, BUY this immediately to keep things in one location and in reach. Overall, I rate this product 4 out of 5!
1	Good value: might not stand the test of time, but at this price you cant go wrong. Great for camera equipment, and handguns.
1	Great storage case: I actually didn't get this for pistols. It works great to store our electronic depth sounder and fish finder with all its cables and attachments.
1	A book for all ages: I'm12 but I really like this picture book. I learned a lot about what Henry Thoreau was trying to do when he built a cabin by Walden Pond, and it was fun learning it through this book. The illustrations are funny and I like how Henry solves his problems. I also like Henry Hikes to Fitchburg, which is even funnier because Henry makes his friend learn a lesson in a funny way. I also recommend another great book about Henrey Thoreau, that especially girls of all ages will like, Louisa May and Mr. Thoreau's Flute. It talks about how Henrey Thoreau helped Louisa May Alcott learn to like the outdoors and learn to like writing. Henry's funny in that book too so I think readers will like it too.
1	Wedding Goddess is divine: Wedding Goddess is a soulful look at the sacred ritual of marriage. Laurie Sue Brockway brings you into the world of weddings in the most beautiful, altruistic sense rather than how the machine of the wedding industry commercializes it. Laurie Sue is a minister who customizes weddings to the individual--there's no pat formula here, just two people in love coming together in the way that makes them feel most connected. This book is for those who are getting married but also for everyone who wants to open your heart and honor the committment to yourself and humanity.
1	Scary for Grown Ups!: Before "Leaving Las Vegas" Mike Figgis directed this rather nasty adult thriller which features Kim Novak's most recent film appearance to date. She's brilliant in this small part as a dying woman reunited with the son she gave up for adoption. As she slips into morphine induced dementia, he stumbles into...incest?...adultery?...ghosts?... I'm not sure but anyway, my blood ran cold for weeks. This is recommended especially to people who miss Ken Russell's exuberant directorial excesses!
0	For Collectors Only?: This is far from being the best NRBQ album available. As the "best bar band in the world", they have made a series of loose but imaginitive and fun recordings. Later, when they tried to make "serious" recordings, some of the fun may have been missing, but this was made up for by top-notch writing and interesting arrangements. This project is neither tight nor fun. "Me and the Boys" is perhaps the only memorable song. The singing and playing are lacksidaisical, and overall it seems like the whole band would rather be elsewhere. You might want to skip this one unless you are a die-hard fan.
1	A Different Sequel to American Graffiti.: Most of the Original Cast are back, expect for Oscar-Winner:Richard Dreyfuss. This film tells the tales of Seven Friends (Ron Howard, Cindy Williams, Paul Le Mat, Charles Martin Smith, Candy Clark, Mackenzie Phillips and Bo Hopkins), which they are in Different Situations in the Evolution of the Mid-Sixties.Directed by B.W.L. Norton, this is Surprisngly Well Made Sequel. Written by Willard Huyck, Gloria Katz, George Lucas and Bill L. Norton. This has a lot of Bright Moments. Harrison Ford has a Cameo as a Motorcylce Officer and Delroy Lindo, then Unknown has a Scene with Actor:Smith. This was a Small Hit in Theaters. Some Might have a hard time watching this film, because it`s filmed in Different Aspect Ratios of this Film. Part of the Movie is Filmed in Panavision. Grade:A-.
0	No where near the Original: If you like the original. You may be disapointed. I was. I wanted to see a real continuation. What I got was meany hard to follow snips. I think the director could not get them all in one place again. So, they wrote small movies for each.
0	Not as Good as the Original!!!: More American Graffiti is kind of sad to me. It shows how everone is living in 3 or 4 time zones. It's sad that Terry the toad's girlfriend forgets him and becomes a hippie. The ending is the most sad because you know John Milner is about to die because of a drunk driver. I probably wouldn't recommend MORE AMERICAN GRAFFITI!!!
1	All The Great Oldies!: Wow, all the great oldies from the movie. And arrived very quickly, even though Standard shipping was selected.
0	A clear look at Islam: A good resource to take you behind all the headlines and propaganda to the heart of Islam. The book is a thorough and clear presentation for those of us who know little about Islam. Plainly written and easy to search.
0	Horrible reception: I had this hooked up with digital cable. I tried going through the regular cable line and S-video. Going through the regular cable line resulted in an awfully grainy screen. Going through S-video didn't make it any less grainy, but it completely washed out the color of the signal. All the whites on the screen took over the other colors. Do not go with this card.
1	Amazing Immune booster: Cats Claw is such an effective immunobooster that the AMA has listed it as a drug to avoid in the case of organ transplant. I'm sold.
1	jumpstarter: Fantastic product! Good value. We can say nothing negative about it. We carry it with us on trips. Family members borrow it. Wow - what more can be said.
1	Works well so far, radio needs improvement: The powerpack delivers but it promises. Portable power, both DC and AC. Trickle charger and the light work well. I haven't had any problems with my unit yet but the radio definitely needs improvement. Although it has a digital tuner, adjacent stations seem to overlap. Also the speaker is very small.
0	Xantrex 852-2000 XPower Powerpack 600HD Portable Battery: I was disapointed. I had hoped it would hold a charge for a lot longer, but it didn't. I used this in a craft booth to light 4 strings of Christmas lights and a tree. It only lasted about 4 - 5 hours. When the battery began to run low, it "Buzzed" really loud.I wish I had picked the bigger one.
0	Worst product I have ever purchased: My Xantrex XPower Powerpack 600 Heavy Duty is not good for an emergency. It is an emergency. The unit does not hold a charge. It takes days to fully charge and loses its charge by10% each day.Xantrex customer service has not been helpful other than to say that I should charge it through my car cigarette lighter.I ask, what should I do charge it all the time. Thats the only way their will be any power when you need it... I bought this item to help if I have a problem... It is the problem.
1	Keep one in your trunk: I purchased this product to use primarily in case my battery died, and secondarily as a portable power source when camping or away from a source of electricity.The powerpack works great when starting any size car with a completely dead battery. The built-in inverter is great to charge cell phones or run small appliances when camping for example.The display is very useful, showing either the percentage charge or the real-time wattage being used.Be forewarned, though, that this item is heavy and portable only inasmuch as it has a handle. I wouldn't lug it too far. Also, while charging is quick through the cigarette lighter cable, it takes a long time through the AC adaptor.Overall, a great purchase.
1	Really great, but...: I used this unit in my travel trailer for about a year before it was stolen. I ran my TV off it, laptop, and when tent camping used it for lights and my laptop and to recharge camera batteries.PROS: Does what it says. Solid; built like a Sherman tank. Idiot-proof. TV ran for about 3 hours, laptop about 4 hours, and15 watt light...forever. Started my car instantly. Plugs high-quality, very solidly built.CONS: WAY heavy; incredibly heavy. Takes forever to recharge, even on car charger; don't believe the stats. The radio and light on the unit are useless and incredibly cheap.
0	Readout Never Worked ;-(: I've had this product for about a year. The readout that tells you how much charge is left never worked!When I first got the product, the readout didn't seem to work according to the directions, but it took me some use to figure out it didn't work properly. I could find out how much charge was left, but it didn't display the info as the directions stated. The item is so heavy and bulky, I decided not to bother returning it and just live with the inconvenience. . .Now, after three or four camping trips worth of use, the readout doesn't work at all! There's no way to find out how much charge the unit has remaining. I just have to find out when it dies. Not very convenient at all.
0	Somebody Help: I have nothing but trouble with the battery company that sent the power pack 600HD. I have never been able to charge it because of a defective charger. They cannot send me a replacement because they do not have one. They want me to pay full postage to send back the defective charger. They offered me a choice of replacement or junk and refund. I chose junk and refund since it is impossible to send such a heavy thing back at my cost. I bought this in August and have not received a refund, am being charged with interest, and have a $325 item I cannot use. When I called "Mark" he told me I was unreasonable to talk to and to call back when I calmed down. HELP. I only want to charge what I think would be a good battery to take camping or stop charging me and calling me unreasonable.
0	THEY TRY BUT THEY CAN'T: They try hard, but they can't make Van Damme seems like a good actor. The plot about twin is a clever idea, but it doesn't work at all. Bad...........
0	A Real Snoozer: Hard to believe that someone could take one of the most dramatic events of the twentieth century and make it this mind-numbingly boring. Written with an overly verbose, convoluted style, it just never seemed to get to the point. NOTE to future authors: three page end notes have a name - THEY'RE CALLED CHAPTERS. The text reads like a caricature of a blabbering communist from an old movie from the Fifties in Hollywood.
0	Ten Days That Shook the World: I read a lot of history books and I just found this very boring. I gave up after reading 50%.
0	Giant Disappointment: Hilary Mantel has a unique ability to tell a story through the conversations of her characters. The book is carried along by each character's thoughts and words. This story told in the Irish dialect of its subjects, is at times amusing and often poignant, but ultimately depressing. Frankly there were no surprises in this story. It ground along with the giant and his retinue heading for their predictable end.After reading Mantel's last book, Bring Up the Bodies, I was really disappointed in this one. She has certainly honed her craft since this early work.
1	DreamCatcher!: Jonesy, Beaver, Henry, and Pete are four young friends who save a boy named Duddits,who had a syndrome. They helped Duddits from other boys in another words they were his protectors. From that day they found a special bond between them who immunes them with each other.Every year they go up to Maine for their annual hunting trip.While they were their they saw strange things happening, and witness, for the first time, creatures beyond their imagination. Soon they found out that they are taking part in alien invasion. Two friend died during the book Pete and Beaver. The other two friends Jonesy and Henry save the Earth from contaminated water supply with a disease called Byrus. In ending they found out that they saved the world by aliens from their friend "DreamCatcher," Duddits.
1	Satisfying King: As Stephen King gets older, his books get bigger, as seems to happen to most authors. Sometimes though, they fail to satisfy. This one did not.Coming off of his horrible accident where he was hit by a van, King included a lot of his pain and feelings of growing older in this book. It makes the book more personal, and more refreshing. There is the true Stephen King in the emotions of the characters.Being an alien invasion book, I enjoyed it too for it's unique spin on alien life, and how they might invade. I don't think this was overall as creepy as some of his other works have been, though this certainly had its moments.All that said, the book wasn't literary greatness, but I wasn't expecting it to be. It was a horror novel by King, and it was entertaining. I wasn't expecting anything but that.But I'm glad I read it. Well done.
0	SK's worst ever, really0 stars: I hated it. Bad plot, poorly delivered, terrible book. SK has written some really good books, but this one was so bad I have not read another SK since. I do not believe would even be published if unknown author. Don't waste your time!
0	Tried to like it...: As a huge fan of early Stephen King works, I had heard that this was so much like "IT" and "The Stand" and so I was excited about reading it. In my opinion it was totally vulgar and I don't think that all that vulgarity was necessary to create the story. I found the book to be confusing as well, towards the end. There were times when I had to stop reading it as I felt sick to my stomach....maybe that's a good thing??!! King is still in my opinion an extremly great writer but I thinkat times he tries too hard to be gross. All in all, I was disappointed...hopefully the next one will be better...
0	Not His Best: Like many others I am a big fan of Stephen King. Most of his books are terrific but "Dreamcatcher" joins his other two bombs, "The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon" and "The Talisman". The first part of the book is well written but it later deteriorates into gibberish. I had a hard time telling who was in who's mind or who was doing what to which when. As someone once said "In every fat book there's a thin book trying to get out". King claims to have written this whole book with a fountain pen. I hope he has gotten over his writer's cramp by now so he can start on a better book up to his usual higher standard. Think thin (or is it "Thinner".
1	One of Stephen King's best novels.: Definately one of the best books I've read in awhile. Even though the book is long the story grips you and you can't put the book down. Can't wait for the movie to come out.
0	Gak. . .: I've been reading S.K. since1980: I'm pretty well acquainted with his writing. Sooo. . .This book is really, really bad. The story is SO absurd (WHERE the creatures came from had to be the lowest and most perverse idea S.K. had ever had); I hated every character (wanted them ALL to die after the first few chapters)and the story itself was plodding (it took the characters about a thousand pages to travel from Point A to Point B).This was a book written just to get something new on the shelves.I was very disappointed. I can see the book on my shelf with the bookmark about fifty pages from the end; can't bring myself to finish it.I'm warning everyone away from this one.
0	Makes Tommyknockers look like genius: I never thought I would say this, but this makes 'The Tommyknockers' look like a really excellent book... this is not up to par with King's recent offerings such as 'Bag of Bones' and 'Hearts in Atlantis.' King goes for the the gross-out in this book, and leaves the reader cringing with graphic images of various bodily functions. I am a big King fan, but I cannot in good conscience reccommend this book.
1	Audio CDs are Copy Protected: I thought the story was great. Jeffrey DeMunn does an excellent job reading and acting it. Be advised though - you will not be able to listen to these 20 CDs on your computer nor will you be able to rip them down to a single MP3 CD.
1	Very Good: While I would not say this is the be all end all Stephen King book, I think traditional King fans will be pleased with this new offering. It is a throwback to It,and Tommyknockers and I enjoyed it much more than both of those. In a nutshell the story is about 5 friends, one having Downs Syndrome who is also a powerful Phychic, He in a way passes his gift along to his 4 friends who must use their skills to survive an alien invasion while hunting in the woods. It is very scary at times at really gross to (which is good to some people :)). In closing I will say you will never be able to sit on the toilet without thinking twice again.
0	His15 MINUTES ARE UP.: I was a die-hard SK fan until about 4 books ago. He's lost his touch. I so wanted to like this book, but it's bad, really bad. Incomprehensible and all over the place, and much, much too long. Sorry, Mr. King.
0	Not as good as most of his books: I have always been an huge S.K. fan. I was disappointed in this one, however. It starts out good, but towards the end it becomes long, drawn out and boring. I had to make myself finish it. The concept of the book is good, and had the latter part of the book flowed as easily as the first part, it would have been very good.
1	Riveting! Reads like a true crime thriller!: Fast paced book. Though I have no connection to finance, I was intrigued by the story on the back cover and began reading. It's incredible that this is a true life story. The only dry part was at the end with the criminal trials and some of the finance was hard to follow but I just skipped over the technical mumbojumbo. This guy is innocent.
1	it is very good: i like this dvd, and the service was good,and it came when they said it would. i wish there was a fourth season of this show.i would get it.
1	Perfect for a Companion Piece to a Young Man's Wallet: I purchased this for my grandson as a companion piece to his wallet. He makes sure he carries this everywhere along with his wallet. It prevents carrying a lot of loose change and it's very appropriate for a boy to carry since there is nothing 'girlie' about it. My dad always carried a change pouch too since he couldn't stand loose change jingling around in his pocket, and my grandson enjoys it for the very same reason. I highly recommend this product.
0	Squeeze coin Pouch: Nice leather. The squeeze portion broke immediately and I was never able to use it. Overall not a well designed product.
1	How Fi Dance!!: Whoa!! This DVD is tight work, for real. This DVD breaks everything DOWN SO WELL (BLASE, SIGNAL THA PLANE, LOG ON, ON LINE, EXCEPT THE HEEL TO TOE). I cannot wait for Vol. 2 to come out. The LEARN segment is cool for real, but the SEE segment is off tha chain. This DVD is worth the money if you are seriously trying to learn the dances, but if you are just trying to see the dances then this is not the DVD because the SEE segment is not showing anything but 'sex in the club with your clothes on'. I have never seen anything like this in any of the Reggae clubs that I have been to, but hey not every club is the same. How Fi Dance is cool with me.
0	Good recording of a forgettable concerto: This would be a reasonable purchase for one with intense desire to complete a Yo-Yo Ma or John Williams collection. However Williams' cello concerto presents many problems for the listener, with poor development and often monotonous forays into atonalism. The technical aspects of the recording and Ma's performance are excellent, but far more beautiful compositions have been written for this instrument.
0	shafi: I have been looking for a book for my children to share thorugh illustrations and imagination the stories of my childhood when it came to the Legend of the Old Befana. I found this to be the closest so far yet it does not follow through on the tradion that follows the Befana each year in Italy. It did not captivate my our my son and I found myself having to more explaining than sharing The drawings are nice though.
1	This is a must for all du Maurier fans!: If you enjoyed her classic, Rachel, then this book is a must. Once again Daphne du Maurier succeeds in evoking the mystery and charm of Cornwall by setting her intriguing characters and rivetting story plots in this beautiful area.
1	Just what I needed.: This was high on my Wife's Christmas list and it was reasonably priced, can't ask for much more than that.
1	the gift: my favorite Christmas music, hard to find. was glad to be able to find it at amazon at this price.
1	Gödel's Proof: The copy I read is the edition of Nagel and Newman's1958 book revised in 2001 by Douglas Hofstadter, author in1979 ofGödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid. Nagel and Newman do a good job in their first six chapters of orienting the reader towards Gödel's proof, and give a clear overview of the proof in their detailed chapter seven. They don't overwhelm the beginner (for whom the book was written) with the painstaking details of the proof. They don't describe the construction of a formal language or discuss recursive functions. I think the book deserves its status as a classic of popular mathematics and I recommend it as a first look at Gödel's Incompleteness Theorems.For an accessible look at the historical background in mathematics and logic to Gödel's work, see Morris Kline'sMathematics: The Loss of Certainty. For a scholarly biography of Gödel, see John Dawson'sLogical Dilemmas: The Life and Work of Kurt Godel.
0	defective product: I have used other Yves St, Laurent Touche Eclat products, but thought I'd try the peach. I am very disappointed. The color itself was very harsh, and after the second attempt to push the button to get the product released into the brush, it quit working entirely. I assume the product was old, but under any circumstances it was defective. From now on I'm buying this product in a store where I can return it.
1	three powers: the power of three is a very good book the amazing combinations of life and fantasy are exsqisit and although i am not all the way through i am already searching for another,i am a reader that likes every type of fantasy, but i like the strongest the best so when they learn about electricity i got kind of dissapointed but other than that it is a terrific book.
0	Side Effects: In the literature it always states that it is extremely rare for people to experience side effects. However, I do NOT think this is the case if you are very sensitive to medications. If you are, you will want to take a much lower dose of this potent herb. The recommended dose threw me into a detox that was utterly miserable and lasted for weeks. It took me a while to put two and two together as I just thought I was sick. The same day I stopped taking this product, my symptoms went away.
0	Can't hold a candle to Billy Blanks: Don't waste your money on this one. I wish I could get my money back. Poor taping quality, poor instructions, poor everything!
1	Rush Revealed: I have been a Rush fan since I was in Jr. High back in the mid 80's. As I became older, I realized what a powerhouse of talent these guys are. This documentary is well put together, and despite what others have said....it does not seem rushed to me. It tracks the band back to friendships that started before the music. I found it very interesting and all in all a touching story about a group of good friends who have shared the struggles, highs, tragedies, success and fame while making some of the most complex progressive rock music in history.All three seem to be just simple good guys, and that really comes through in this story. Awesome music and a real "suck it" to the industry that didn't really want them to succeed.Great....just great.
1	Rush fans will love it: Both DVD's are great. Make sure you watch both. I understand the band personalities much more now. It covers from the very first high school gig thru and after Peart's family loss and the band reuniting.If you like RUSH, you really NEED to watch this.
1	The Greatest Band in the Galaxy!: Having been a fan of Rush for nearly thirty years, this film/documentary was truly enjoyable. The directors did an outstanding job capturing the human side of these three musical pioneers. Well worth the wait!!
1	Must see rock film: Not one for hyperbole, and hard to please, quite frankly. I feel like I've seen it all. But Beyond the Lighted Stage truly is one of the best rock films (the best?) AND documentaries I've ever seen. I've now watched it twice and I liked it BETTER the second time!We live in a mixed up, tortuous world. But a beautiful world too - where good people can get together to do great things. And - do it their way. What a great story. Neil Peart's Dad's comments about the day he joined Rush - man, if that doesn't get you fired up and warm your heart, nothing will.
1	Awesome!: What a great DVD for Rush fans. The early videos are great. The number of musicians that have been influenced by Rush is huge. They truely are a unique band--love them or hate them. One of the best things in the video is the dinner at the hunting lodge. I couldn't stop laughing! Those scenes are worth the price right there. Alex has a tremendous sense of humor. I think the most important thing these guys have is a true friendship for each other and they don't take themselves overly seriously. Really, a must-see for Rush fans.
1	Rush Fans Grab this You will LOVE it: If you are a true Rush fan you will really Love this, it gives back history and shows that these 3 guys are truly Rock Gods that don't get the glory and praise that they desirve. After all this time they can still write and preform truly outstanding,meaningful music that will just kick your ass, They have infulinced rock music more than most and yet the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame still won't see how truly outstanding they are, maybe they should watch this DVD.
1	Great video: Tremendous career retrospective from a band like no other. Very, very well done, as with Dunn's other work. I am a huge Rush fan, and like any, this gave some unique perspectives deeper into the band, tied up some loose ends--and left a few more mysteries in our grasp. Bravo!
1	obviously talented: This is a good disk. In fact very good. However it's a bit frustrating because there are flashes of absolute and utter brilliance....Then there are parts that are a bit forgettable.In a just world "couldn't you tell" would be a top10 hit on the radio. "Emily's dead to me" is quite delicate and beautiful. "Hide, run away" is also very good. This guy definately has a knack for creating hooks and emotional tension in his songs.
1	Clearly one of the best debuts of05': BC Camplight didn't make a perfect record but his debut "hide, run away" clearly marks the arrival of a true talent. His writing style, which has been compared to Burt Bacharach and Randy Newman, along with his macabre lyrics and humorously modest approach are a winning combination. Check out this cd if you are a fan of Todd Rundgren, Brian wilson, Randy Newman, Burt Bacharach, and Belle and Sebastian.
0	Not as advertised: My son is very disappointed because the illustrations on the "Look Inside" feature are nowhere to be found. It is possible that this may be the best story ever written but please deliver what is advertised. Have a fabulous day.I called Amazon and some lady with a thick foreign accent answered. She was very nice and had a good handle on the language. She assured me that she would send a copy that matched the description on the website. Unfortunately I received the same book. There are no illustrations in this book. This is a bad experience with this book but I still love Amazon.
0	Not the best telling: I read three versions of the Arthurian legends recently, and this one was the weakest. The language is somewhere between Malory's archaic form and modern prose, but does not succeed well at being either. The tales were also, in my opinion, less well told than in the others.For your consideration, I read La Morte D'Arthur in an abridged version and Roger Lancelyn Green's "King Arthur and His Knights of the Round Table" from the Puffin Classics series. I enjoyed Green's telling the best, as it was credibly compiled from a number of works (including Malory) and had some excellent atmospheric illustrations. Though it is a Puffin Classics edition, I did not find the usual condescension or "dumbing down" that often occurs in youth literature.Get Green's version. It was just as cheap right here on Amazon, and well worth every penny.
1	The "Citizen Kane" of Canadian Frat Movies: Just like my title said, this movie is the "Citizen Kane" of Canadian Frat Movies. It's ultra raunchy, made up of fart humor, vomit humor, getting people high at a funeral, among other things. It's politically incorrect, and darn proud of it. Catch it if you can.
0	Terrible graphics, OK recipes: As soon as I opened this book, I didn't want to make any of the recipes, simply because the pictures were so awful. The layout is amatuerish and the photos are simply unappetizing. Presentation counts almost as much as flovor- if this is what my meals are going to look like, then I'll pass.
1	WE ALL NEED TO READ THIS ONE & PASS IT ON!: WOW! She did her homework! It is all in here. Some startling insights and provocative thinking. After you read this one, you may rethink your reality. Perhaps we all need to read this to make sure we haven't overlooked some significant details! This should be in EVERY school, EVERY hospital, EVERY clinic, EVERY doctors office and every child protection agency office. If you suspect Abuse- get this book. You will gain valuable insight and will be able to see things you might otherwise have missed!
0	Not the best study guide available: I used this book in a TOEFL preparation course for about a month and found it a bit disappointing. The book's explanations are quite technical (which is sometimes helpful, especially in the grammar section) but my intermediate-level students all found the practice exercises in the book too easy. The CD-ROM practice tests, on the other hand, were too hard. Some of the Writing section's explanations were good--especially with thesis statements and conclusions--but the Reading section was ridiculously banal. In addition, there aren't enough practice tests, especially in comparison with other TOEFL study materials available on the market. For the price you're paying, you'd be better off buying Longman's Complete Preparation (for intermediate to advanced students), Longman's Introductory Preparation (for beginner students), or Barron's TOEFL book with 8 practice tests.
1	Homework review: This is a great book by Edgar Allan Poe that is filled with great "Poe"ms. My favorite is the poem called "The Raven." Some of the poems are a bit scary, and there are some scary pictures. I would recommend it for ages 8+. There are also poems that you can't find in any of Poe's books because they are shortened versions of larger, unabridged poems. Also, some of the poems have to do with death. Thanks to Brod Bagert, (editor) Carolynn Cobleigh, (illustrator) and of course, Edgar Allan Poe.
1	very good.....: if u dnt read at least one work of edgar allen poe by the time ur 30, u mite as wel b pronounced brain dead....
1	An abbreviated collection of Como's Christmas songs: This CD has only10 of Perry Como's songs on it. If you like Perry Como, you should get a bigger collection, or buy this one for no more than $6 brand new. It is a small album, but if you're a big fan you could pay a small price for it and be happy with it.
0	Not as I remember: I used to watch the Perry Como show as a kid and thought he was cool back then. This CD was a bit disappointing - I thought the music was listless and didn't have quite the Christmas spirit/enthusiasm as I had hoped.
1	"The Mummy" by Marion: I was a big fan of the orginal "Mummy" and was anxious to see the remake. The first time I did I laughed! I thought it was so stupid I'd never care to see it again BUT BOY WAS I WRONG. The next day I wanted to see it again, and then again. I ended up seeing it about 7 times in 3 days, I was that hooked. And the music is so fantastic I rushed to get the CD. Plus I got the book! This is one of the BEST movies I have ever seen; and it's a unique combination of horror and comedy. But one question: If Imhotep was all wrapped in linen, HOW did he scratch "Death is only the beginning" inside his sarcophagus? And where did he get that massive hole in his head? These and other questions are worth overlooking. Watch this movie!
1	An excellent must-see: In this powerfully wonderful action film, severeal men look for a treasure and unearth a horrible master of complete cursed destruction, an all-powerful all-deadly mummy who was mummified alive and cursed. He rains on plague after another plague on Egypt.No one knows how to destroy this monster. He tries to reincarnate Anck-su-namun, his fomer love. The film has violent action,powerful mummies, and a scantily clad woman to enjoy looking at. The film is wonderful ... and action-packed for125 minutes of power and suspense. The only flaw was Beni, the stupid character. An absolute must-see for the whole family
1	Not "Great" but a "Good" one!: All right - I admit, the movie is good: Good jokes, good action, good sound, A-M-A-Z-I-N-G special effects, a little bit of frightning here, a little bit of frightning there.. Well, ok, so what this a "4 star movie" and not "5 star"? It's resemblance to Indiana Jones! I know it's a totaly different story and all, but I can't help it - It's just too similar in the music, the places shown and the characters..
1	The Mummy: The first time I saw this movie I thought it was not going to be good. Like who wants to see a mummy chase people. But till I saw the whole move it was great. It was filled with action pack adventure and laughter. The Mummy was about a group of people searching for a long-lost treasure but unearthed a 3,000 year old legacy. Now it is going after them since they broke the curse.Do they have time to destroy the mummy before the world comes to an end. This is a good action epic, visual effect, and great story telling. With great actors like Brendan Fraiser, Rachel Weisz,John Hannan,Jonathon Hyde,Kevin J. O'Connor and Arnold Vosloo. This is a great movie to see.
0	Terrible movie. Don't waste your time or money.: After viewing for about10 minutes, I noticed a disagreeable odor being emitted from the disc. It wasn't the disc, it was that stupid movie. If this is what passes for entertainment now days, we are in worse shape than I imagined.
0	no no no no NO!!: This movie sucks big time, although the special effects were OK. ILM could of done alot better. PLEASE STAY WELL CLEAR OF THIS FILM!! Would the producers of this film please promise us that they won't make a sequel. ILM please don't work with these films. Their ruining your reputation.
0	The special fx were sub-par and that was the best part!: Avoid this film at all costs! The special effects, the film's only redeeming feature, are sub-par because they are used in a hideously predictable way. A horror film that doesn't scare at all. Actors who are best suited for roles in the adult film industry and a script which was evidently buried in the desert and never found. Who the hell green-lighted this effects-laden dungheap? I've wasted my money on other film like Deep Impact and Conspiracy Theory, but this film was a waste of my time! I could have spent those125 minutes doing something else. Maximum Overdrive, the Emilio Estevez tour de force, was at least brainless fun. This film is just brainless. Do Hollywood a favor and buy or rent some pornography or Faces of Death instead of this cinematic black hole. Don't give them your money! (I saw this film for free and it still drained me of my valuable time. Don't waste your life, don't buy or rent this film!)
1	A vastly amusing movie: I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. While it lacks the lovely atmospheric creepiness of the1932 film it claims to be a remake of, it has a good-natured sense of adventure and is well cast. In truth it seems to be more of a remake in the style of Hammer Studio's Mummy films, but thankfully does not include the title character lurching around shedding bandages everywhere. Considering the stomach-dropping, heart-sickening disappointment the other big "horror" remake,"The Haunting," from the summer this film came out, and despite the occasional plot-hole (but let's face it, this film wasn't intended to be a ground-breaking, truth-shattering film, it was meant to be entertainment), "The Mummy" did not deserve the poor reviews it got from the critics.
0	super predictable rubbish: The original is much better, at least in terms of including a few unexpected twists and turns. If you want to know what is going to happen next in this cgi "masterpiece", just apply the following formula ... what new element has just been introduced to the picture? how might it suddenly spring to life and kill someone? The scene with the scarab beetle being picked off the wall is a good example.BORING!!!!
0	Belongs on MST3K: This was possibly the worst movie I have seen in a long time. Very few films manage to get everything wrong, but this one did. Expect a weak plot and a poor computer generated setting laced with general inaccuracies. There are a few moments of good acting with some characters, but they are canceled out by the horrible 'acting' of characters such as the mummy, which stares at a character for ten seconds, then growls.
1	Great Special Effects With Humor Throughout: I thought that this movie was great. I love Brendan Frasier's acting ability and I can always expect to laugh when I am watching a film he is in. I felt that the story line could have moved a little faster at the beginning with a little less violence but all and all a fun movie to watch.
0	I wasn't sure if it was supposed to be a comedy or a horror: Visual effects aside, this movie was really quite dumb. My eleven year old twins enjoyed it and that was about the intellectual level the film. It seemed like Brendan Frazier wasn't quite sure if the film should be a comedy or a horror show. It seemed as though he wasn't quite sure how to act, funny or scared. It was quite violent at times and too many people died. I would not rent it again. If it wasn't for the visual effects--I would have rated the film1 star.
1	Rachel Wiesz is incredible!: I loved this movie, and that surprised me, because my tastes tend toward Bogart movies, or Gregory Peck or Audrey Hepburn. But this movie is wonderful! one minute you're scared out of your mind, and the next you are laughing. Not many movies can pull that off. Frasier is also solid (in my opinion) in his role. OK, so he's not Bogart, but still convincing in his charactar. Rachel Wiesz is nothing short of amazing! Of course, those big brown eyes do help! I think she has to be the most stunningly beautiful actress around. "The Mummy" is no classic, but its still worth the money for one wild ride!
1	This film is not bad!: Well, I loved the Indiana Jones movies and [guess what!] I love this one as well!The special effects are really good and many of the scenes are hilarious.However, I've only seen this film once, so I'm not sure if it starts to get boring once you've seen it a few more times.
1	A Thoroughly Satisfying Adventure Movie: The Mummy is high quality entertainment. It does a great job of entertaining, that's saying something. Some movies can't even do that. But this succeeds on all levels.It's a great popcorn flick. And it's packed to the brim with action.The DVD features a commentary from the director Stephen Sommers, deleted scenes, a few making of featurettes, and a bevy of other special features including trailers and a music only track.If you're a fan of action, definitely recommended.
1	Hahahahahahahahahaha: I loved this movie and this keyboard I'm typing on is kind of whacky so any mistakes are probably not my fault.Back to the movie: it was a lot of fun. Brendan Fraser kept me laughing. The characters were pretty well drawn. And all the expendables were somehow still endearing. John Hannah was standout. Very funny guy. "Bad luck, old mum," and "Im-ho-tep," were probably the funniest lines in the whole movie. The special effects were stunning and the action was pulse pounding.A couple of quibbles with minor spoilers: if the beetles ate Imhotep, "very slowly," in the words of the female lead, then how come they devoured that poor guy in the passageway in like .5 seconds? And how come the Imhotep took the eyes of Burns, who wore glasses? I expected to see the mummy staggering around like Burns did when his glasses wer knocked off.Any way very good. Little language and the violence isn't bloody or too gruesome with the possible exception of the burrowing bugs.
1	better than the1932 classic: the mummy ultimate edition dvd is one of the best films i have on dvd. the mummy is truly spectacular. with huge special effects good actors and acting the mummy never runs out of adrenaline. brendan fraser and rachel weisz are superb as Rick O'Connell and Evelyn the librarian are perfectly fit. one of the best films of the1990's. the mummy packs a wallop!
1	Mummy...the ultimate movie!: I really loved this movie, i remember seeing it the next day after star wars come out and loving the fact it is a new Indiana jones type movie, sure there has been many tries at those type but this movie is dead on, only missing doctor jones. The movie is not scary but a load of fun and a good adventure. if you have the regular dvd then skip this and save your money as it's not enough extras to make it worth it the mummy returns is out on dvd soon so the spotlight on it here is not worth it.but if you don't have the mummy yet on dvd then get this one since it's both widescreen and fullscreen and the extras are nice.
0	Another worthless Remake: Hollywood must think that fans of Horrormovies are Braindead,otherwise they would have choosen to use either the version proposed by Clive Barker or Joe Dante for the Remake of "The Mummy"Instead a mediocre script was choosen,and a less then mediocre actor,Brendan Fraser(George of the Jungle) was hired for the lead role and to top it all of,very bad CGI(Cheap Gimmicky Images? )where used in this worthless Remake! But I guess that's all that is needed to have a Summer Blockbuster?
0	very disappointing: Having grown the love the Richard Jury mysteries, I was bitterly disappointed by this novel. I tried to wade through it but it was so gawd-awful boring that I just gave up.
0	Not worth the cost.: Bought 2 shirts $29.99 did not really think this through for the shipping charges $20 per shirt, 2 shirts came in one box(size of a medium pizza box).The company did offer to take the shipment back but, it was too late, I opened the shirts. After 2 washes, they are not holding up too well, so overall. I would not endorse this company or product.Amazon though, did acknowledge my issue with this shipping transaction as best they could. I hope they will improve for the next buyer.
0	Huge disappointment: I've played all of the CSI games and the three L&O games prior to this one and, man, was I let down by this. It's a huge resource hog - it took almost10 minutes to install the thing and it took even longer to uninstall it. When the installation is complete it automatically sends a registration (to whom and with what information is unknown - a major privacy violation) without giving the opportunity to say no. The game play isn't intuitive at all and doesn't follow the same conventions established in the earlier offerings. The PDA thing is a pain in the [...], there's no right-click functionality, limited options in terms of configuration (cannot play it in other than full screen), and NO INSTRUCTIONS! Not happy at all with this.
0	Poor quality: After first time worn it turned color. It is too thick and cumbersome to wear as a toe ring. Very poor deign.

0	THESE ARE KNOCK OFFS, THEY ARE HORRIBLE: I BUY THESE BLADES FOR MY HUSBAND ABOUT ONCE A MONTH. WE HAVE NEVER HAD AN ISSUE BEFORE. I SEARCHED AND FOUND SOME THAT WERE CHEAPER ON AMAZON THOUGH A WHOLESALER, ALL THE TIME WHOLESALE. THEY WERE17.99+4.59 SHIPPING. HE GOT THEM A WEEK LATER. THE FIST TIME HE USED THEM HE HAD CUTS ALL OVER HIS FACE, HE STILL HAD SHORT HAIRS THAT HAD NOT BEEN SHAVED OFF AS THE BLADE WAS VERY DULL, AND HIS FACE WAS BURNING. ON THE BACK OF THE BLADE THE ORANGE STRIP HAD BEEN WORN OFF JUST FROM ONE SHAVE. THESE ARE DEFINATLY KNOCK OFFS. WE COMPARED THEM FROM ONES WE ORDERED BEFORE AND THEY DO NOT LOOK THE SAME. I USED ONE OF THE BLADES TO SEE IF MY HUSBAND WAS RIGHT, AND IT WAS HORRIBLE. I GOT RASOR BURN AND STILL HAD LITTLE HAIRS THAT WERE NOT REMOVED AS THE BLADE WAS SO DULL. WE WILL NEVER PURCHASE BLADES FROM ALL THE TIME WHOLE SALE AGAIN, OR EVEN AMAZON IF THEY CONTINUE DOING BUSINESS WITH THEM .
0	Pretty sure they are not authentic!: I am currently talking to the people over at Gillette over the concern that this product listed on Amazon may be counterfeit. The razors are not shaving smoothly, they are very very rough and tear up my face. Now when I have purchased this same product from places like cvs, walmart and target; they shave so smoothly and gently. Also the packaging looks off. I will not be buying again from Amazon if they are allowing counterfeit goods on their site.
1	Great!: This item came to me in a timely manner and there was absolutely nothing wrong with this product.
1	La mejor afeitadora del momento: Yo llevo casi 2 años afeitandome con la Fusion Power y afirmo que es la mejor afeitadora del mundo. Yo uso cada cartucho 5 veces, y afeitan bien hasta el ultimo uso.
0	This review is for the R-Rated version: Wicked Sister is an interesting movie starring two half sisters Chelsea and Misty Mundae. Misty plays the bad sister who gets her good sister Chelsea into some bad trouble at school and now they're on the lam. Along the way the meet a crazy woman who wants to play a game with the two. An entertaining movie that is hampered by heavy editing.It's okay, but get the unrated one instead.
0	Bordering on incoherent: As a grdauate student, I feel compelled to write honestly about this book in the hopes that what I'm writing might influence some teacher's decision in the future. Granted, the topic area this book is covering isn't trivial, but in the light of its complex nature it is even more paramount that someone attempting to explain it to those who don't understand it be well-versed in, frankly, English. This book is quite possibly the worst textbook I have ever encountered. The writing is atrocious, the "flow" is like mud, and the explanations make even things that could be simple, dreadfully complex. Avoid it like the plague, there are a lot better options.
1	Infant Fun: My son is14 weeks old. He started playing with this toy at about13 weeks. So far he is in heaven with this toy. When I lay him on the floor to play he loves to bat at the toy to activate it. He loves the lights, and music, and looking at the fish. It is really neat to see him start to learn that if he moves his arm and hits the bowl it will start up again. It is very entertaining for him. I wish there were more toys like this for my infant. Since he can't sit up yet it is really hard to find stuff to occupy him and this is a definate hit with him. When I put him on his stomach it encourages him to lift his head up so he can look at the lights in the bowl. I love this toy!
1	great toy: my son loved it when he was little, and now my other son is playing with he and he seems to love it too!
0	too many negatives: I just got this toy for my six month old daughter and I cannot recommend it. Here is why:The batteries don't last at all (empty after ten days)It is way too heavy, my daughter can already pick it up and if she drops it on her head it will really hurt her.The lights and music come on by the slightest touch or vibration, she does not have to do anything to help her learn (like putting the balls in the middle) - just me walking by will make it come on.
0	Don't Know Yet: My daughter is 61/2 months old. She's been sitting up for at least 2 weeks. She laughs at this toy when I activate the music. She picks up the balls if I hand them to her. Otherwise, she is NOT interested. Things may change.....but so far, I like this more than she does.
1	Fantastic addition for any road warrior: I run my own insurance business and was always inundated by a sea of paperwork. This little scanner fits into my BJC-85 printer and serves double duty - I can scan and then print with the same machine. Genius! I would have liked the ability to scan documents into a pdf format, but you can't have everything. This little scanner is the main reason I will not upgrade my BJC-85, as it is not compatible with later models.
0	I have had more fun with a bag of sharp glass.: The creators of this game wasted great graphics on a game with not enough depth. The only time I had fun playing this is when I paused it and took a nap and had a dream about Pamela Anderson. There weren't any guns and the game was way to hard.
1	Worth it: My daughter got this toy last Christmas when she was 2. She liked it, but wasn't totally enthused. Now at 3, she is more into it & we tried another cartridge (Science- Living Things). I am a middle school science teacher & I was really impressed with this cartridge! My son is15 mos & he also really loves Kasey, but I have to cover the on/off button & play with him. My daugher is able to play with Kasey independently. The only thing that I really don't like about the toy is the screen - it really needs its own light source. It is too dark & hard to see sometimes, esp. if you aren't right in front of it in a bright room. This is tough when you are playing with a child who may a need a little help - it is hard for you both to see. Kasey the Kinderbot is really cute & teaches a lot. It is very different from the Leap Pad type toys, so it is still worth getting even if you have one of those already.
1	Best toy I ever purchased: Kasey the Kinderbot is truly the best toy I ever purchased! I have a 3 year old girl and an 8 year old boy and both love it. It really does make learning fun for both of them. Both have used it constantly. Luckily, my son is gone to school all day.I had the 2XL Robot as a kid and this is basically the same thing but even better. Better get yours sooner rather than later. This toy will most likely be the HOT toy for this Christmas season.
1	My 3 year old LOVES his KASEY!!!!: And so do I. It has a volume control on it to boot!This is the PERFECT educational toy to hold my little mans attention while I get some housework done. He EVEN knows how to change the learning functions on the back. He LOVES IT and will probably love it for a long time more....when he outgrows it, it will go to his baby brother or sister who is on the way.
0	But is it accurate?: Following is the review I left on another web site: So far I found 2 errors which MS confirmed: page 4, definition of UTP; and, page17, max segment length10base2; these are the errors I caught with my limited knowledge; my faith in the accuracy of the book has been undermined. I find this frustrating because I was looking forward to reading this book; I am now afraid to commit to memory anything I read within it.
1	Lovely Ring: I bought this as a surprise for my daughter--so, I guessed at the size. Boy, was I way off! The shop took it back and sent another with no problems. My daughter loves it!
0	Much Too Expensive: I bought the Fusion manual razor and after using the two included cartridges and then seeing the cost of replacement cartridges, I have tossed my Fusion. Replacement Fusion cartridges are much too expensive and the shave one gets from them simply does not justify this kind of expense. I think the pricing of Fusion cartridges is like that of gasoline: we are being milked of every cent we are willing to part with.Another issue I'm concerned about is that the clamshell packaging is dangerous if it is anything like the packaging used for Mach 3 cartridges. The plastic of the packaging will stab or slice you. It is unsafe for most adults. The government ought to force Gillette to design safer packaging.The main reason for giving this product1 star is the price. I'm not willing to part with $22 to $28 for 8 shaving cartridges.
0	Getting burned: I tried this but it was not working out for me, and had lot of issues. I was getting cuts and burns. The Fusion Proglide Power was ideal for me once I changed. No burns/cuts with Proglide power. (Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Cartridge 8 Count
1	Great price, but still expensive!: While this is the most affordable option for this item I found, it is still quite expensive. Glad to find them here.
1	Razors: Fast and good service. I really appreciate your efforts. Too bad we have to use so many words to put in our review!
0	These are not real Gillette blades!: These blades are counterfeit! I alternated daily between these blades and the identical blades purchased from Walgreens. It took only 3 shaves for the blue strip on these to be worn off, versus 9 shaves with the same blade from Walgreens. Shaves were all in the shower at the same time of day with the same shaving cream. They are just plain fakes. I tried this test with 4 of these blades, and the same result happened every time. They are just plain fake!
0	Seems like knock-offs: not as sharp as the one you buy from duane reade... these will give you cuts and burn.. will not buy again
0	Doing bad business: The product did not show up on time. I tried to email the seller but they never got back to me. I still have no idea if they are going to give me the product. It is just bad business and I am shopping elsewhere.
1	Great for everyday shaving needs: I am quite picky about my razor blades, since my neck can be cut by a razor pretty easily. The Fusion has completely eliminated the problem of my razor nicking my neck. Though there are five blades, the way they are spaced creates dramatically less pressure on your skin. This results in a nick-free, incredibly close shave.In addition to the five-bladed front, a single blade is on the back to allow for fine trimming, like the edges of beards and sideburns.The one downside of this blade is that it tends to do less well if you let a few days' worth of whiskers accumulate; they tend to get caught up in the blades. You can avoid this by shaving every or every other day, or using another razor or trimmer to cut the whiskers short and then use the Fusion to finish them off.For those of use who will be shaving every day though, the Fusion is our blade.
0	Knock-offs!: These are knock-offs. They HURT! The blades aren't well aligned and look different from those in locally bought cartridges.
1	Great deal: These are the same razors you purchase at the store- but for a third less. Even beats costco's pricing. Great deal
0	Knockoff: Aside from the fact that it took two weeks for my order to arrive, once it finally arrived the shirt appeared to be a knockoff. In comparison to another Duofold item I purchased from another seller, this shirt is clearly inferior - not only is the material different but the tag appears to be an iron-on copy with several of the words blacked out. I would never buy from this seller again.
1	high society: This is the first Nero Wolfe novel but not the first Nero Wolfe investigation: Nero and Archie have been together for some years, and some people owe them great debts of gratitude. Like many later stories, this is largely set in Westchester County. There is a definite affinity with P. G. Wodehouse in the mixture of accuracy and escapist fantasy.
0	OK but not great: It's a fairly readable book, but there are quite a few errors.The book is strongly based on the open-the-loop method to find loaded Q, but this method is heavily flawed due to the impedances where the loop is broken being not known.
0	Technical book purchase review.: High Performance Linux Clusters with OSCAR, Rocks, OpenMosix, and MPI (Nutshell Handbooks)The main issue I found is that the purchase was mislead. I was trying to buy a hard copy and they gave me a kindle copy instead without warning!
1	What Makes The Perfect Balaclava?: What makes the perfect balaclava?Ideally it should be elastic, silky smooth, durable and help draw sweat away from your head.Most balaclavas nowadays are made of nylon/acrylic & spandex. Why? It is elastic and remains that way after many uses. Cotton balaclavas will stretch over time and will not retain their elasticity. Silk materials wear down very easily and the material can "ball up" creating those annoying lint balls. The last thing you want against your face are those things.Nylon/acrylic is more durable and feels just as silky smooth as real silk. They help you wick out the sweat and are easy to clean.I've sold balaclavas of different materials and find my customers overwhelmingly prefer the synthetic nylon/acrylic material.
0	Unfortunately, I can not recommend this book...: Although I appreciate the amount of effort required to write a book, I simply can not recommend this one. The book describes unimportant or familiar concepts (like the traditional relational model) in too much detail and new or important concepts (like the Oracle8 object extension syntax) in not enough detail. Many of the diagrams do not appear to relate to the topics being discussed and the examples are too few and far between. I felt that the author used terminology inconsistently or at the very least did not define terms adequately. One might argue that the book is about object-oriented design and not about Oracle `syntax' but if you want to learn about OO check-out books by Booch, Jacobson, Fowler, Rumbaugh, Wirfs-Brock, etc. If you want to learn about Oracle objects try "Oracle8 Design Using UML Object Modeling" by Dorsey et. al.
0	as ugly as it gets: UFC 43 is a joke of an event. There is only one good fight which is the main event. The rest of the card is saved for no namers or fat has-beens such as Kimo and Tank. You can tell that all these guys have very little skill compared to the guys in Pride and sometimes are akin to fat barroom brawlers.Pride FC is the top organization in the world. Sadly, the UFC is far behind.
1	Great for Pilates Classes: I just bought this and used it in my Pilates class for the first time today. My students loved it and I loved it too. It is even great for easy listening while cleaning your house or enjoying a nice afternoon relaxation.
1	My favorite Metheny CD: I listened to this cassette quite a bit back in1985 and then left it for quite a while. Last year (2003), I was amazed to find myself humming "Yolanda, You Learn" and ordered the CD from Amazon. Discovering this music all over again was a joy. To me, this is a CD of uplifting, joyous music made by fantastic musicians offering up some incredible performances.While I have listened to other Metheny releases, nothing has touched me like this one. I would loved to have given this five stars, but the decision to include "Forward March" was a mistake. Fortunately, modern CD players can be programmed to skip tracks. My favorite tracks are "Yolanda, You Learn," "The First Circle," and "Praise." "If I Could" is so beautiful in its simplicity as to bring you to goosebumps and tears.If you are a guitarist or lover of Brazilian music, this CD is a must-have. This release is totally accessible to all lovers of quality music. Highly recommended.
1	Better than first impression!: The MonsterGecko FPS mouse it much better than it looks. Trust me. Even I looked at it at first and thought it was a waste of time. But when I saw it for a great black Friday deal, I picked it up because I was curious. Now I can safely say it's well worth the purchase. The mouse has a good resolution, and the shame is more than a gimmick. It really does feel great to use, games or not! I recommend this product by far!
0	Pass: Novelty item, not real usable: Though very well built, and fun to hold, it's not usable if you're already good at first-person shooters using a mouse -well, not without some serious retraining of your hand and wrist. Especially games heavy on right-click, like Unreal Tournament. It's basically a mouse, only bulkier and less comfortable for extended play.
0	Pointless: If you read the book Jane Eyre you will soon understand the moral concept of what I am saying.When I bought this book I was hoping for a sequal. Instead Emma Tennant turned around all of Brontes work in to something awful and stupid. The worst part is they made Mrs. Fairfax the bad guy in this book. In Jane Eyre she was a good old lady servingthe house. But the way emma Tennant wrote the book she changed nearly half of what everything is supposed to be about.Also they rebuilt Thornfield. Confused? Look at the name. It was a place of terror that held to many memories that haunted people.
1	VERY GOOD!: I bought this item from davewemall recently and it came very quickly. They provided good service and when I got the item, it was exactly the item I wanted. Thanks davewebmall!
0	Pretty but flimsy: This is a very attractive feeder, but the problems I have will keep me from buying another.The slide-clip opens with very little pressure - the squirrels pop it open every third or fourth landing.The wire hanger is close to breaking near the slide-clip.The slide-clip is a marvelous idea, but the application is weak.It is very simple to clean. The side panels lift out so they can be thoroughly scrubbed, and once they are out, the inside of the feeder is easily accessible.
0	Nice looking, but sloppy feeder: At first, I was quite pleased with the feeder. It looks nice and the birds (although restricted to small birds) frequented this feeder often, to the point where I was going through bird seed fairly quickly. However, when I took a closer look, I found most of the bird feed on the ground. When I started watching the birds very closely, I would estimate that for every seed the bird took from the feeder, 3 or 4 seeds would fall to the ground. The feeding holes are fairly large and I expect this contributes to the seed falling out.
1	Value Feeder: Overall a very good item. Holds plenty of seed, however just as others, much of the seed falls to the ground as the birds are feeding. The only good thing there is that once the feeder's empty, the birds fly down to clean up the rest.
1	Topeak Exployer Bike Rack with Spring: It was beyond my expectations. Its a sturdy well constructed rack.The spring on the rack works great! Combine withn the bike bag I purchased its all I need for my cycling experience.
1	Great rack for bigger bikes: After ordering two racks that would not mount properly, I ended up getting this one. My 25" Trek is a huge bike and no other racks would mount at the right angle. This one however, fits like a glove.High quality build, very sturdy and solid. Lots of adjust ability so it'll fit everything from my wifes17.5" frame to my 25".
1	Functional tent: Hey, it is what it is---a tent for the outdoors. I got this for my three month old son who likes to sit outside. My two cats like it, too, and sit in there with him. There is plenty of space for all three.
0	UV rating?: Contrary to the Amazon description, this play tent does not offer any UV protection. Nowhere on the packaging does it mention SPF or UV protection. Misleading and disappointing.
1	Great play tent fits in very small bag: I bought this tent to take to the beach for my 8 month old. The bag it comes in is so small that I thought, at first, that the tent may be too small for my baby. The tent is a great size for an 8 month old and even a little larger. It's very durable and is great for the beach, except that, when your baby isn't in it, you need to put something in it to keep it from blowing away. The assembly was very easy for my husband who has assemble tents before, but I found it a bit more difficult. I would recommend that you face the solid purple tent side in the direction of the sun as the shear sides don't provide shade. The first day we used it on the beach, I ended up draping our beach towels over the side to shield my napping baby from the sun. Overall, I am VERY happy with my purchase of this tent. I think it is value priced, and it fits back into its very small back with ease.
0	Boring, not very educational: My daughter has been playing with the Fisher Price Grand Piano which is by far better than this piano. Fisher Price Grand Piano has the keys light up, has different modes for music, learning (numbers1-8, colors, pitch, and rhythm), also you can play the piano by tapping the individual keys.This particular Rock and Roll Piano doesn't light up, plays different types of musical instruments, but the keys aren't as fun to play. My daughter played it a few times and went straight back to the Grand Piano. Consider buying that one instead.
0	heinous: This is the most terrible, emotionally offensive film ever created. After watching this movie, my eyes began to bulge from my head and limbs began to fall off. Watch this movie if you like the feeling of having your organs ruptured.
0	Horrendous: Anybody that would sit through something so stupid like this movie should be shot. I was not one of the other losers I have what they called taste in movies in this day and age and this is just flat out retarted. Its also a shame i have to give this movie1 star it makes me feel as though i support this shi* in a way. I just wonder if the acting in it could be half as bad as the movie or the plotI wouldnt watch this if i was paid, Wake up America and today's youth
1	Wonderful read aloud book!: I read this book to my11 year old son. Both of us were captivated with Roald Dahl's experiences prior to and during World War II.Though our family has thoroughly enjoyed all of Dahl's fiction, this is the first non-fiction Dahl book we have read. The way he describes the people, places and machinery he encounters is so real and honest. He comes across as an astute observer during the times he describes. I found this book to be entertaining and educational. I only wish he had written more books about the next decades of his life.
0	Dead or didn't work: I spent time installing this - had to remove the CPU cooler and reinstall it... and it completely failed to work! I called Antec and they mentioned a compatibility problem with 965 boards (which I was using) and this PS. Supposedly I had a "fixed" unit though, but it failed to work. Going back to the old PS (an Antec SmartPower) worked without a problem.
0	Not a good fit: The tent seems to be good. But the tunnel does not fit well into the tent. Just comes off too easily when the kids try to crawl through it. Would find a better tent tunnel combination that holds up strong.
0	too narrow: I have worn many Easy Spirit shoes over the years and owned this particular style at least 4 times. Unfortunately this pair was way too narrow! What happened?
1	Best I've Used: I was pleasantly surprised. This is really the best razor I have ever used. I just assumed that having 4 blades was just another gimmick, but it really provides an amazingly smooth and clean shave and minimizes nicks and cuts.
1	Good value for a great product: My older black retreiver has flaky and peeling skin. She had a thyroid condition and we use this shampoo. It really soothes and seems to help.
1	Jewelry clean solution: Use in my ultrasonic unit and makes everything look brand new. I recommend you heat solution in microwave before adding to unit to boost cleaning power on grease/lotion which sticks to prongs.
1	Great read: Overall, easy transaction. The book is very touchy on provoking emotions from the reader. The published stories in the book are very eyeopening and realistic. Sender made the transaction easy to work with.
0	Usual Glacial Paced Novel from James: This is so typical of H. James writing...very, make that incredibly, dense. Wordy beyond belief. At a pace that surely puts me fast asleep after a mere 2 pages. A ridiculous pair of uncaring parents essentially abandon their daughter to whomever comes along. As an amazing coincidence, the divorced parents each take a new spouse only to watch the wife of one have an affair with the husband of the other. If you are really into dialogue that no one has ever spoken in the history of English and willing to devote hours to really obscure language construction, this is the very winner for you.
0	I love classics. I'll never read Henry James again.: It's his style I can't get my arms around...conceptually interesting, but his writing here flows like a gutter clogged with leaves, only occasionally achieving the fluidity I look for in fine writing. I chose it because it was shorter than some of the more famous ones. Life is too short. I'll sell it back.
0	not durable: Several of these came with my crossbow so I used them to sight in and bought Gold Tip brand bolts for hunting. They're a bit brittle/ fragile as compared to the Gold Tip bolts. They were destroyed by target shooting, some had the inserts pull out and left the insert and broadhead inside my target and others snapped off when I pulled them out. It seemed to me like just the force of hitting the layered target was enough to crack the arrow or break the glue loose and they finished breaking when I tried to pull them out.
0	warning about motorola phones: The product has a USB port but it is not compatible with my Motorola phone, the phone says unauthorized power supply and disconnects.Works with ipods but I think the Motorola expects a "smart" usb port it can talk to and this must not be one.
1	Amazing product: This is a cool product, so far I don't have any problems with this. It charges my Iphone, and any other small units. I haven't tried this in a long drive yet but I'll give you guys an update when I drive from NY to TX this summer. Well, so far so good!Cons: The only thing I notice is that you can't really tell if it's "on" since the "ON" button's light is unnoticeable, it is just useless unless you try to wrap your hands around it to dim the area. BUt I still would recommend it to anyone I know!
1	In agreement with others: I would have to echo the sentiments of many of the other reviews. I bought this when my11 month old son started pushing everything he could around the living room. He loves it but it is way too fast for his little legs. Also, it moves around when he is just trying to play with the balls and net because you can't stabilize it. Plus when the balls disappear he gets very disappointed.It's definitely going to help his walking but it's a constant supervision toy.
0	It sucks!: My daughter is a year old. We got the walker a few months ago. My husband put it together, we helped our daughter hold on to the handle and it flew out from under her like a bullet!She would sometimes crawl behind it and push it. But, she got bored with that. Now that she has started walking she doesn't pay any attention to it. We fixed it where she can sit on it and push herself along, but her legs are too short. She threw balls into the basket a couple of times, but she has another toy that she can throw balls in that she likes a lot better.Also, the annoying music comes on so easily. All you have to do is walk near it and it goes off.We're getting her something different soon.
1	My 3 year old still plays with this: My 3 year old loves this toy. It's now an outside toy, but she has consistently played with it since day one. She learned to push with it (watch out for wood floors, it tends to go fast). She loved the balls and the sounds as well. Now it's a ride on toy that she's a little tall for, but she still scoots around on it.We left it outside and that ruined the sound, but for us it was a good thing. ;)
0	Not Safe: I've never written a review on an item, but I will on this one. My daughter is about1 year old and this product is not very good for a baby learning to walk. As soon as she pushed it into a wall and leaned forward the whole thing almost flipped over. Could have caused a serious injury had I not been right there. I don't see how it has such a high rating by other users.
0	Horrible toy...: My daughter received this toy when she was about11 months old and we eventually had to throw it in the garbage!!! Every single time she bumped into the wall or a piece of furniture it would nose dive and she would end up with her belly in the "v" section of the walker flying like superman! I can't tell you how many times the toy flipped over and she was hurt and crying hysterically! I am seriously shocked at how many people love this toy!! Obviously it is top heavy and not very safe for a new walker! My opinion is save your money and try a different push-ride on toy.
0	Not Useful as a Walker for all Children: My child could not use this as a walker. The protruding arms that are used later on for them to ride did not give her enough room to walk in between them. I took it back.
1	cute and durable: this toy:is easy to put togetherdurableeasily (and securely) claps shut to transition to ride-oncolorfulhas cute musici cannot think of anything i dislike about this toy. it even has little area in the front for baby's feet so you can push them.
1	Gamma Good: Gamma's high rise gold 75 is the best ball hopper I've ever owned. I've been playing tennis for over 20 years. Gamma good!
1	Funny Horror!: Another one of those humorous horror movies that you liked as a kid. It's Creature Feature on a sleigh ride. Fun.
1	Fun!!: I bought this tunnel for my daughter for her first birthday, and she has loved it ever since! She has so much fun crawling through the tunnel and hiding in there. It is a great chance for any child to get exercise and to add some fun and excitement to their day!
1	great toy: I just bought this tunnel for my two year old daughter. Her nursery school has the neon see-me connecting tunnel, and she just loves it. They didn't have that one at our local [store], so we bought the 6' Find-Me Play Tunnel. I think this tunnel will last a long time. My kids have already jumped on top of it, and the dog even tried to crawl through. It seems to be quite durable and is not made of cheap plastic like some of the less expensive tunnels. It's definitely worth the extra money.
1	Excellent Lens!: I don't have much to say that hasn't been said before. This is the sharpest lens I own and it has become my "gold standard". The image quality of all of my other lenses get compared to this one.This is also the first lens that I have owned which has exceeded the capabilities of my camera. As I zoom in, my other lenses would lose sharpness before the image would pixelate. With this lens, I was sharp down to the pixel level. This inspired me to upgrade from a 6MP K100DS to a12MP K-r.The images from this lens are extremely lifelike and the colors are superb. I get more "keepers" using the DA 40mm than with any other lens.
0	Disappointing: I think had this book been labelled "romantic erotica" instead of romance, I would have been less disappointed with the story. Because having the characters say 'I love you' a lot doesn't make it a romance (especially when they've known each other for all of a day)! Both Connor and Adam felt very 'flat' to me- there wasn't anything to differentiate them from the surrounding characters, and the surrounding characters weren't painted all that vividly either. It's hard to get into a story like this when you don't care what happens to the characters. The heavy-handed exposition and info dumping was also quite irritating, as was the fetishization of aboriginal people.
1	Rutger Hauer Exemplified: Loved it, typically audacious atrocious and ribald. What's not to like about castles, bows & arrows and mid evil...evil complete with rape, pilliage and plunder; and torture and gore!
0	AWFUL: Just horrible. Good looking guys but that does not make make up for the long periods of boredom.One of the worse movies I have EVER seen.
1	Present for a friend: A friend of mine is a cake decorator and is always looking for new styles and ways to make her creations. I bought this for her birthday and she loved it. She was excited to get a book from Debbie Brown, which she said was the best cake decorator she knew about. So a really big smile on her face was enough for me to realize that I got a good present.
0	doncha think: that this song is better promoted for itself rather than on the strength of PR trickery trying to capitalize on all things web-based?it's a cynical marketing world that tries to sell us its corporate soap wrapped up with a hippy or a punk bow
0	DO NOT BUY IF IT'S SOLD AND SHIPPED BY AMAZON.COM: Amazon sent me a BOOTLEG copy of this album. There was a SCANNED picture as an insert and the cd was a CD-R. There was no back to this case at all.!! They are selling it for full retail price, and sending out bootlegs. Amazon refused to help and told me they will investigate why they are bootleg but that is it..really?? They refused me of a refund as well! Disgusting!
0	Nice thought but too weak: in the age of the overblown Rod Stewart&Clay Aikens trying to Romance a Era gone by with very Sub-Par Results add another victim to the list.Mandy Moore.now Mandy Moore Vocally is closer to Jessica Simpson,&Christina,Monica,Beyonce,but Mandy's material is Lite in the Booty.Her Material ain't no threat to Vocal Light Weights like Brittney,J-Lo,Ashanti&Others.the concept of Her doing this&at Her Age being aware of the Past because lets be real:Most Peeps coming along today are pushed by the Media&other sources as thinking that Old School is Last Summer&this is Offically the Fall now.Mandy doesn't have enough juice to make Her take on these Songs Believable fully.now in any 20 years She might be a bit more Seasoned&She might find that Connie Francis Element She has in Her.stay tunned.
0	Could have been........: With gleeful anticipation I purchased this cd hoping to hear some wonderful reinditions of some excellent songs. Boy, was I dissappointed!There are twelve cuts on this cd, everything from Joan Armatrading to Blondie. Clearly the best cut here is a wonderful cover of John Hiatt's "Have a Little Faith in Me". After that, Carly Simon's "Anticipation" and E.John's "Mona Lisas and Mad Hatters" round out all that is worthy of mention on this cd. Skip everything else. Besides a poor selection of songs and an even poorer performance, there is a feeling of being rushed through the music presented here. This just destroys any connection with the songs. A little less pace would have given more of a feel for the songs here. The quintiessential cover cd of the year is Michael McDonald's "Motown", this could have been in that league. But it isn't, skip it and wait for the next effort.
0	Not great: I agree with an earlier review in that the first three songs are not good and they sound the same. The rest is okay but not great. She definitely has a very good voice and could probably come out with an amazing cd someday, but this is not it. Some of the covers were pleasant to listen to but not one of them touched anywhere near the realm of the original singer's version. I would wait and buy a used copy if you're thinking of buying it.
0	Disappointing....: I've been a fan of Mandy Moore from the beginning, but that was way back in 2000. I was hoping that she would have evolved a little bit more being that it is 2007. This cd was not entirely a waste of money, but there were only 2 or 3 songs worth listening to more than once.
1	Yey!: Ummmm You don't have to be an adult to like these songs. In fact that was what I was afraid of when many posted the clips of her new songs on her website. They sounded old... But listening to the whole song is a different story, they have jazzed up the songs a bit with some new souding stuf and it's Great!. Hard Core Mandy Fans(like me) will love it! It's not the buggle gummy pop sound she had with her first album, nor is it the middle eastern kindo f sound from her last one, it's something new and it is awesome! She didn't write any of the songs, but she makes them her own. If you like mandy at all, then you should get this album!
0	Sub Zero's worst role ever (LOGO) SMK: How could Ed Boon do this to my favorite MK character Sub Zero. What a discrace to the MK series.Sucky graphics,sucky moves, and is very complicated.Trust me don't even try this game ever.If you would like to see more of my reviews look for my logo which is SMK at the top or bottom of the review.OUT!(LOGO)SMK
1	Gets the job done.: This drying rack gets the job done. Sometimes the plastic pieces at the end of the legs come off, but no biggie. You can just pop'em right back on.If you need a drying rack for 2 people (or maybe eve three) this is a good choice.
0	tough to read: The author (translator?) ignores the standard use of quotation marks. This makes it extremely difficult to follow conversations in the book. So I was completely distracted from the actual content of the book.
0	tedious run-on sentences; shallow characters: I'm sure Saramago's Nobel Prize was not based on this work. Not one person in my book group was able to finish this book because of the tedious, run-on sentences (the first chapter is all one sentence), and characters too shallow to care about plodding further. The initial premise was interesting -- how one word could change the entire perspective of historical events -- but failed to deliver.
1	Great: Fantastic game but the controles are preset and can not be reconfigured.I am used to configuring the controles a certain way and could not get used to this setup.I guess it is like the old saying ( You can't teach an old dog new tricks )I am a gamer and this is the first time I have seen this.Hope this is not the way of the future in games.But SIERRA comes up with a lot of weird stuff.
0	Not Compatible with windows 7: I gave one star because i could not play game.Im glad i only paid $6.95.Thair is a way to get the game to play on windows 7,you have to set you boot advanced options to1 core every time you want to play game.
1	You go boy!: I know it's mostly just covers, but that's what makes it good! Harlemm takes the classics and makes them his own. His voice is amazing and I just love listening to him. He may be short and bald, but he's adorable none the less. When are you going on tour?!?!?
0	Hated It!!!!: I can't believe how bad this sounds. There are a lot better singers that are just starting out. I wouldn't recommend this cd!
1	Baby loves it, so do I!: This is a wonderful item. My son loves to try and catch the fish as they are moving around. The music and sounds will lull him to sleep in no time at all.
0	Too Loud: I recently had to replace my Peaceful Planet Aquarium with the Ocean Wonders Aquarium. I am not pleased with the Ocean Wonders, it is obnoxiously loud, there is nothing "peaceful" or "aquatic" about the aquarium. Needless to say I am returning the Ocean Wonders and purchasing another Peaceful Planet off of Ebay.
0	Not my son's favorite: My friends recommended this product, but we had a bad experience with it. First of all, the bubble setting makes a rather loud noise and my son had trouble falling asleep. Second, and the most painful, once my son learned to roll over and scoot around, he kept hitting the bottom of the toy with his head and needless to say was getting really upset about it. We kept it in his crib for about 3 weeks and now it's stored in the closet. It was not the best investment for us.
0	WILL NEVER PURCHASE USED AGAIN: I have been searching for a fishbowl crib toy for my daughter for a while now. I came across this particular one, and the seller100% GUARANTEED my satisfaction! BULL! Seller claimed that all toys were tested prior to shipping, guess they forgot this one?? The entire right side has no working bubbles, the big fish in the middle does not move at all. Seller also claimed there were no scratches or marks, yet theres a scratch on the bottom, and what looks like yellow and pink marker on it. I am so disappointed its unreal!!!
1	Works wonders when putting your child to sleep!: The Ocean Wonders Aquarium was one of the last items I registered for but is by far, one of the best presents we have received for our newborn son. My husband and I used it from the first day our son was born and at two months of age, he still falls asleep to this music. For a newborn, the Ocean Wonders Aquarium is much better then any mobile as kids do not follow the moving objects until they are at least couple of weeks old but they do respond to sounds. The music is very soothing and will calm a crying baby in minutes. The downside -15 mins of playing might not be enough so pressing the play button several times can be a pain expecially at night if you have a separate baby room. A remote control would be a great improvement.
0	boring and stupid, get a mobile: this toy is another attempt by toymakers to teach infants to be content alone in their cribs. anyone who still buys into the idea that babies will and should fall asleep alone should get a full grown dog, not have a baby. this toy is so pathetic that it can only grasp for the attention of a very young babies, my four month old was bored with it immediately. do yourself and your baby a favor. rock, nurse and sing your baby to sleep yourself. if you want a crib toy get your baby a mobile or 2. they are much more interesting for the baby.
1	Won't Travel Without It: Our son is 8 months old and we've been using the Ocean Wonders Aquarium in his crib since he was about 2 or 3 months old. He has grown to expect the same song every time he goes in for a nap or to bed for the night. There are three settings on it, one is just music, the next is music and lights (this is the setting we use), and the 3rd is music, lights, and bubbles(vibrations). Now when our son wakes in the middle of the night, he reaches up and turns his music on himself and puts himself back to sleep! When we are away from home and we bring the aquarium, it gives him a touch of home and soothes him to sleep. I recommend it often to my friends who are expecting.
1	The best bedtime toy: We first learned about this toy when our baby was in the hospital. We attached it to his crib and he loved it. He loved it so much that we went and got one for him. Whenever he is upset we just have to turn it on and he calms right down. It has different settings so they either have something to see, listen to or both. It is really great for a young baby.I do not think that any nursery should be without this toy.
1	Don't go home from the hospital without it!: This was the one thing that would soothe our son when we brought him home from the hospital. He is 3 months old now and sleeping through the night. When he wakes up he starts to kick and swing his arms and he accidentally turns the aquarium on. He falls right back to sleep! The aquarium will only stay on for 5 minutes. This was not long enough when he was a newborn. I would have to stay in the room for 5 minutes to turn it back on. He likes the ocean sounds better than the music and the louder the better.
0	has no water after being in the closet for 2 years.: My 3 year old son played with this all the time till he got to be a year old then i put it in the closet for a while till i had my 2nd son and just toke it out and now it has no water inside and the fish dont move either. Is there some where i can take it to get a replacement?
1	Perfect for Bed Time!!!: The best thing about this crib toy is the volume control. My 3-month old is content to lay there by herself just looking at the lights (only at night time though). Great for when she is semi-sleepy, following the lights knocks her out.
1	This makes your bedtime routine easy!: I have used this aquarium in my daughter's crib since she was two months old. She is now10 months and still loves it! More importantly, when we lay her down and press it on, the music signals to her that it is time for bed. She willingly rolls over to look at it and eventually falls asleep. She used to press it on herself in the middle of the night to go back to sleep(when her crib was lower and the aquarium was more accessible). I would reccommend this soothing toy to anyone and suggest to start using it early on. The only modifications I would make would be a remote control for parents to turn it on without entering the room(it only goes for 7 minutes) and maybe longer straps so that when the crib is lowered the baby can still reach it.
1	Great Entertainment: We bought this for my 2 month old daughter because she loves my parents fish tank. At first she wasn't all that intested in it, but now she loves it. At 4 months she turns it on all by herself with her feet. It has several different music/sounds to choose from. It was well worth the investment.
0	who picked the music...???: we had bought the previous model of this crib toy for our older son, but some of the moving parts had frozen over time in storage, so we decided to replace it since he loved it so much. that version had happy, cheerful nursery songs. the new version plays an almost eerie, creepy, surreal-type music that actually made my youngest son cry! it's a good thing the new model comes with a silent mode (bubble sounds) or we would've returned it.visually, the toy is mesmerizing and my son likes it as long as we don't play the music.
1	The music stops too soon!!!: I cannot compare it to anything else since we bought it for our first child. She LOVES to watch the fish move and she tries to grab things. I put her in her crib when I am folding her clothes etc. The problem is that I am constantly running back and forth to turn the music back on!!! It ends too soon and that is what she loves! Other than that, we do like it, it keeps her entertained.
1	Put baby to sleep fast: I got this when my son was four months old and he is now14 months old and still uses it to go sleep. He loves to "talk" to the fish and every night. He loves to push the buttons all the time to make it go. When he was younger the music on this was the only thing that calmed him down. It is very durable as my two year has unhook it and it fell on the floor and it still works fine. I would recommend this to everyone,the money is well worh it, and I know he will be using this for several more years as he loves this still.
1	My daughter has loved it since she was a newborn: I recieved this at my baby shower. My daughter has loved it since the day I brought her home from the hospital. She listens to it every night when she goes to bed. She would always smile when i would turn it on when she was just a few weeks old, even if she was sleeping. Now she is 9 months old and still loves it. It is easy fopr her to turn on and make the little star fish move. She will sit and pay with it for quite some time
0	5 minutes??: I bought this item thinking that it would be a wonderful thing to have in my son's crib to help him fall asleep. It takes more than 5-10 minutes though for him to in fact fall asleep. So when it turns off he just starts to cry because he hasn't figured out how to turn it on again. Also just the fact that it has to be constantly turned on defeats the purpose because it just keeps my son awake. It's cute but there have been better sleep aids in the past that are not on the market any more.
1	get TWO!: This was the BEST thing we got for a baby shower gift. The motor gave out after being played over and Over and OVER and **OVER** again every night for 5 years. He wanted a replacement one but we finally convinced him it was for babies and he was too grown up for it. As another reviewer said, it would be better if it played longer - our son would just be drifting off and it would shut off, then he would pop back awake & start it over again.
1	What would we do without it??!!: This is the greatest thing!! We use it every night to put our12 week old daughter to bed after her lullaby. She goes into her crib wide awake but this is so calming and soothing to her that 9 times out of10 she falls asleep within 5 minutes. The variety of settings is great too - we use the bubbles (and lights and music) if she's really awake and the lights and music only if she's already a bit sleepy. It is truly wonderful! We traveled with it as well and it really held up, in checked baggage on the airlines through three connections each way. If I were going to change anything it would be to make the volume go even a bit lower, but this is very minor. Overall we love it and would be lost without it! I keep spare batteries on hand at all times!
0	An awful textbook!: This was one of the worst textbooks I've ever read. It drones on in excruciating detail for pages before finally stating the main point or idea. People don't think that way. State what you're talking about and then give the supporting details and examples. Not the other way around. It is a very frustrating read. I had to reference other resources in order understand the theories and concepts presented in this book.
0	Waste of money: This book is not cram at all. Not even detail to cover up the exam. I think only good as extra reference for studying. It is waste of money.
1	GREAT REFERENCE BOOK! GLAD I HAD IT!: I had a pediatrician that wasn't much help on the breastfeeding issue. I didn't know many people who had breastfed and I picked up this book at the store. It was absolutely invaluable to me and I referenced it many times. I now have a healthy1 year old daughter and I attribute that robust health to giving her the right start in life. I was able to continue nursing her right up to her1st birthday and I don't think I could have done it without this book.
1	Another Great Epic from Mr. Vidal: I just love the Narratives of Empire books from Mr. Vidal. This is the first book of these that I bought and fell in love with the story. Since then I have purchased the other books in the series and am just about finished with Empire and will be re-reading Hollywood next. For me I love the excursion to Hollywood of the silent era which I have done some reading on so much of what Mr. Vidal writes of I have read of before. It does help if you have a grasp not only of politics of the early part of the last century and of early Hollywood. Still if you have never heard of Warren G. Harding or D W Griffith you will still love the book because of Mr. Vidal's wonderful writing. His writing is so descriptive that you can see the places he writes about and his humor is such a treat. I would highly recommend these books to anyone and everyone.
0	Feels disconnected: Although my kids (5, 4, and 2) enjoy the pictures, the storyline felt disconnected/lacked smooth transitions. I had to explain a lot of what was going on to my kids rather than the story telling itself as most children's books do.
0	Avoid buying this product!: I read the user review somewhere else and I ignored them. What a fool I was. This product did not pick up any signal from my TV or Radio. Avoid buying this product. I had it return within 3 days of trying.Trust me. DO NOT buy this product (Sennheiser R40).
0	Esta versión está recortada: La novela es genial, inmortal, imperecedera. Pero esta versión que vende Amazon es un versión recortada e incompleta, casi la mitad de la novela que autorizó Tolstoi. No sé si es la misma versión que edita en papel la editorial Juventud que es la mitad de la novela completa. Fue un chasco para mí descubrirlo, pues ya la tenía en papel en la edición de Planeta con la traducción de Alcántara y Laín Entralgo e introducción de Eduardo Mendoza y al compararlas me di cuenta. Espero que Amazon ponga a la venta esta novela en la versión completa, preferiblemente en la traducción de Lydia Kuper. Pr eso mi valoración es por esta versión en concreto no a la novela en sí.
1	Wonderful read: I started this book because my son is a rower and I'd hoped to learn a bit more about the techniques and the mindset of rowers. Sara Hall provides that, but so much more. Her account of coming to grips with an abusive relationship is delicate and sensitive. Many middle-class women can see themselves caught in a subtle dance with a domineering, controlling, cagey husband. The strength she finds through rowing and her connection to community is beautifully portrayed. I encourage every woman to read it.
1	Incredible: One of the best games ever to play against your friends. A top five game as far as the n64 was concerned. Its a game hat changes the football rules slightly while still holding the integrity of what the sport is. Just incredible as far as the fun factor goes. Definately a game that makes pulling the n64 out of the closet. Five stars all the way!
1	First-rate film: Not being an "action" movie buff, I was somewhat surprised that I was hooked on this film. Everything about it was superb. Well acted, very well directed and kept my interest right up to the final credits. The description of this film as a gay "Bonnie and Clyde" was apt, although I still look forward to the day when we don't have to use "gay" to describe a film as anything other than what it is, a great film.
0	not easy set-up: The instructions say that it is easy set-up. However, it is very difficult to get the poles into the correct place to set the tent up. Without forcing too much, the tent tore.
1	A Real Hit with Our18-month old Grandson: I got this for our18-month old grandson for Christmas and this was just the thing for him to satisfy his craving to climb in, around, and behind things! It was larger than I expected, big enough for both of us to sit in, which he loved. Its only been up two days but it seems durable because in the beginning he seemed to try batting it around to test it out and it held up admirably. The colors are bright and it seems well made. I feel certain that he'll play in it often.
0	Not impressed: I was disappointed in the tent part of this set. It's flimsy, and the corners slide/collapse in too easily making the floor space much smaller. The tunnel part is great, though. I much prefer the pop-up house that my kids have.
0	so so good: Works most of the time, But Id say every1 out of 5 staples didnt not come even close to sinking into the wood. We spent a lot of time with a hammer and a punch going back over each staple making sure it was flushed. very time consuming.
0	not received yet: article not received yet, not know the causes , but i will be grateful if you send any information about that .
1	Easy, delicious and nutritous: Easy to make, great tasting, and excellent nutritional value. I add chrushed ice to give it a frosty shake texture.
1	Loose Weight the Healthy way: I lost almost 20 pounds just by taking herbalife nothing really worked for me, i was so desperate didn't know what to do...I even try diet pills over the counter but i always got a side effect by taking them. I'm still loosing weight from 250 pounds to160 pounds (oh yeah baby), Like the song says I'M BRINGING SEXY BACK YEAH! Make sure to use formula1 shake mix and 3 protein, just replace a meal if you don't eat breakfast like me drink the shake every morning ....2 scoops of shake mix and1 scoop of proteinand you'll see results NOT KIDDING!
0	Hmm...: Ok... I seldom write reviews so here it goes.I have never been on a wheight-loss shake diet and was very skeptical about this product. It is true that after eating it you feel satisfied and the taste is not that bad when you blend it with fresh fruits, but beware! if you leave the shake sitting for too long it tastes gross! I made too much once and had to put the remainder in the fridge to drink later. When I went back to my shake it tasted really bad! I'm going to finish up this container and then switch to Kirkland brand wight-loss shakes (the chocolate one is delicious by the way). I hope it really works out for other people, but sadly this product just wasn't for me.
0	FAKE PRODUCT!!!!: This is not a real product from Herbalife, that's why its cheap. It's fake and won't buy it again. I recommend to purchase Herbalife products only from reliable distributors not online. Most products that are sold online already expired. I will report this to Herbalife!
1	VERY GOOD: It was more than an anime, it got something else something, this perpective, it was more than it, the ending was explendid, when they way part of your life is maravillous talk, and all, and make you think, have your life been as wonderful, and also make me think when i grow up, isn't betaiful.
0	Clueless!!: This movie will leave you staring dumbfounded at your screen in disbelief - that you actually sat through 88 minutes of this appalling excuse for entertainment. The characters were as superficial as the plot was non-existent. A couple of cuss words and Sienna Guillory's breasts were thrown in to give it an R rating but truthfully the DVD box should have carried a government health warning. Whatever you do DO NOT buy this movie. Don't even waste the time or money renting it. Alicia Silverstone and Joe Anderson fail to explore their relationship in any dimension whatsoever, and resort to repeated meant-to-be passionate clinches because they literally have nothing to say to each other. And that's it!
0	a beautiful set, but what's the point if the story is nonexistant?: A pointless film that's trying to be as mysterious and mystical as possible and winds up being nothing but boring. Watching the film, there's a sense that there will be some big revelation, something in the script that will make the movie tie together, but that something never appears. In fact, the ending is even more ambiguous than the rest of the film. This movie is nothing but an exercise to show Alicia Silverstone in different stages of undress, and even those scenes aren't very revealing. The entire movie winds up being one bad mind game, or maybe a good one (depending on how you look at it; after all, the game is to get you to watch the movie). The scenery and photography are pretty good but do not make the film redeemable by any means.
1	great cd, speedy delivery: This cd is exactly what I hoped it would be. I play it while I'm cooking or entertaining because it is perfect background music. It makes me want a fondue pot and a set of bongos. Oh,wait, I have bongos already! Anyway, for someone ready to explore latin jazz this is a perfect intro. For those already into latin jazz, Cal Tjader is a must-have. I plan on expanding my collection of his music.
0	A Very Difficult Book from which to Learn HTML: I have now struggled with this book for many hours, and I am still in ignorance of such basic things as "where is white space allowed in HTML," "when is it case-sensitive, if ever," and "when are double quotes required and when not." This book may or may not be a good reference -- I can't tell -- but if you are trying to get started, it is not the right book.
1	Excellent Content: While this book was written by a number of authors all seemed to have made it easy for me to understand what they were writing. Hey, if they can explain to me what's up in the world of HTML, anyone can learn it and this is the book to do it with.
0	Travel Converter: The Converter appears to be fine, except that it only came with the larger plugs used in northern Europe, not the smaller plugs used in southern Europe.
1	Brilliant collection.: This double disc anthology does a wonderful job of spanning Be Bop Deluxe's collected works. The strongest cuts, and the majority of the collection, come from Sunburst Finish, Modern Music, and Futurama(now out of print). The wonderful live album, Live in the Air Age(also out of print), is represented by only two cuts. There are four from the generally weak Axe Victim and a handful from their inconsistent swan song Drastic Plastic. There are also a few rarities tossed in as an added bonus. Bill Nelson's creativity, musicianship(he is a sorely underated guitarist), and songwriting are truly outstanding. This collection is highly recommended...Simon
0	The Ashen Thief: I got dissapointed with this book. the ashen knight was a very good book centered in the knighthood, but in this one they lost that focus, the furores chapter shouldn't be in a book about thiefs, should be more in an Ashen Anarchist.The first part about the medieval underworld is good, but they screw up the rest of the book with the furores section.
0	I can make it better!: I recently purchased a DD50 from ebay - and it was about what I expected. Yamaha make generally good trusty products - but this kit has the same basic flaw as all electronic druma I have tried - that is - the pads do not pick up light strokes - and also don't respond to heavy hits. In other words they don't react anything like real drums.Ok this is a very cheap unit so you get what you pay for right? - well actually - I did design and market electronic drums (analogue type) back in the eighties - and I spent a long time working on this "response" thing - eventually getting very impressive results.So when I got the DD50 recently I immediately set about improving things - and I have devised a fairly simple way of improving the response drastically with a bit of add-on circuitry.If you are interested please email me. mickwest1@hotmail.com
1	Ella sings: I think this is a very good album, but not Ella's best work. Mostly she sticks very close to the melody and words only infrequently adding her own touches, flourishes - style.
0	Had meant to get a 3 USB cord: When I got the procut, saw I had made a mistake, had wanted a 3 USB cable, but these were so cheap, that I could not send them back, may never use them, but the cost was that good of a bargain.
1	Excellent: This product is an amazing price for the quality it produces. As well as an incredible saving price which is extremely low for such a cable. Great delivery, arrived in just 3 days of ordering the product. To recap; amazing product, amazing price, amazing delivery. All in all great service and speed. Thank you ELMENOS for this product.
1	A solid anime title: This anime is a very nice one that is pretty good for its time. The characters are easy to adapt to and some of the moments are very hilarious. The only thing I didnt really aprove of were the tanks. With a name like Tank Police, you'd expect there to be some really cool tank designs, but the action made up for it. The action is very intense and exciting. Seeing a tank jump on to the wing of a plane was so cool. I just wish U.S. Manga would put more thought into the subtitles. The subtitles were so small and hard to read. That aside, I really like this title and I will propably buy the DVD.
1	the best album ive heard in a while: excellent combination of electronic, jazz, and hip-hop with dark musical elements. my favorite is sanity requiem, but could have done with out the john walker track.
0	Disapointing: The book does not focus on the "Scientific and technical" side (only1/3 of the chapters). Maybe that is why the subtitle has disappeared from the cover. Chapters1-9 and 21-24 are generalities about XML and XML-aware applications. These would have been much clearer if the authors omitted to present all these useless options such as PUBLIC identifiers. Chapters10,11 and annex A paraphrase the MathML specifications. The MathML specs, freely downloadable online, are unusually clear themselves so the book does not bring much. I would have liked a word about the XSIL format, an index for the CD, and a correct table of content. I understand that if the authors had taken the time to write a well focused and pedagogical text, it would have been obsolete before publishing. Yet I am still looking for a book on XML for scientists.
1	All Things Ocean: Great story, full of suspense. The surprises will keep you glued to your seat from the beginning to the end. You practically are in the water with the actors. Great movie.
1	Awsome....but....: This is definaately one of the best DVD's around. The options are incredible and both versions are awsome. The only problem I had with the DVD is the fact that it seems like the sound transfer was unbalanced. the dialoug seemed too quiet at parts and i had to constantly lower and raise the levels. otherwise, this is a must have for any movie fan.
0	Lenticular Rip off Do not get OUT FOXED: This is a disgrace Lenticular means a different box cover. this is the first and only version of the movie. Get the 5 star collection.The same this for all the 6-5-07 fox releases. The Dummies at fox did not even notice that on predator is DTS but the new fancy cover say D.D.
0	"The Abyss" Single Disc Edition--Misleading Advertising !!!: Just want to make you all aware that the single disc edition for the DVD THE ABYSS has misleading sound options.The back of the disc jacket states that English 5.1 sound is available.When you engage the menus only English or French surround sound are available.I blew my stack when I noticed this and now I am stuck with an inferior product.
0	The first song is truncated: "Opinion # 33" is really a 5 minute 5 second long song. The 3:24 song that Amazon has is truncated. Amazon should fix this.
1	Angels on my Kindle - Amazon experience: Our pastor was doing a series of sermons based on this book. We were not required to purchase the book. I am so glad I did. The book contained more information about angels than I had ever expected. The content was based on Holy Scripture (The Bible) and cited references. Reading this book inspired me to read more books on angels. This was the first book I had read written by Billy Graham. I had no idea what a great author he was. I have since ordered other books by Billy Graham and am pleased with them all.
1	Excellent Book: Billy Graham really brings home the reality of angels in this book and how they are not some imaginary beings, but mighty warriors used by God for His purposes.
0	Power Jacked: I bought it in January 2004 and the power jack went bad in January 2006. I bought a laptopp on the cheap end, knowing that it would either break or be outdated in a couple of years, and here I am, just as predicted.I have to call Kenmore, now. My two year old refrigerator just stop refrigerating. Ah, the age of great quality and service! (Yes, Mr. Steve. I am sorry to here about your broken equipment, Mr. Steve. I'm sorry, but it seems I can not help you. Please hold.)
1	fresh, independent research lifts a curtain of secrecy: My Democrat friend begged me to read one chapter, 'just this one chapter' she said. I was bitten by the information, by Mr. Umile's straight-forward writing style and read the entire book.His voice is fresh, he's a political independent who tracked down incredible information on Mr. Bush, his family and regime; how can I ignore the facts. Just the facts.Read this and weep my fellow Republicans.
0	booooo!: wow this has got to be the worst game i have ever played. I mean really who wants to go around and deliver papers for a video game when they could be on quests to save the world. instead of quests to get a good tip.
1	You're missing alot by overlooking this album!: Let's put it this way, words are not enough to describe how great this album truly is. A collection of songs filled with hope, love and "Positivity"! Get It!
0	Radio ratios: 21/2This quite abruptly moves between engaging fused funk reminiscent of Jamiroquai, and schmaltzy light jazz reminiscent of your local waiting room, unfortunately focusing a majority on the latter in vein crossover attempts when it is apparent where the talent lies. The clue as for which tracks to avoid? Pretty much anything with vocals-Mcdonalds theme and scats notwithstanding.
0	This book is garbage!: Do not waste your money ! Instead of bying this junk, look for other publishers. A good recommendation would be the Sybex's titles: WOSA I and WOSA II separetely. After failing twice, I bought the Sybex books and passed after a fast read.
0	WA I & II for dummies written by dummies!: I have to agree with the past couple of recent postings! THIS BOOK WILL IN NO WAY PREPARE YOU TO PASS THE EXAMS! Trump one up for Bill and his gang at Redmond for taking our money and laughing all the way to the bank. Save your money and look elsewhere!
0	Should be titled 'A Brief Intro to MS Windows': Good news: the book has great style, format and layout. Bad news: content. I waited until I passed my WinArch exams before I could objectively review this book. This book doesn't 'offer complete preparation for taking and passing MCSD exams 70-160 and 70-161' like the blurb on the book cover states. I complained to MS Press and MCP regarding this statement and a rep from MCP.com admitted (via email) that 'no one source of reference is sufficient to pass the exam'. Too bad MSPress didn't consult MCP (or that person) before designing the book cover. If you are new to programming then you will learn a lot about Windows by reading this book BUT you won't be able to pass the exams! I'm writing to MS Press to request a refund. I suggest everyone who has purchased this book do the same.
0	Good overview maybe, but for passing tests, NO WAY!: I took and passed both WinArch1 & 2 and this book was NO HELP! Don't waste your time with this book unless you are new to Windows Development. I covered more of what was on WinArch preparing for the VB5 Exam than reading this book. The best preparation by far is still the MSDN Library and Transcender as a guide to what to read. I wish MS would support the MCSD program as much as they support MCSE.
0	Begginer content written for an expert: This has begginer level content, although is too complex for any begginer. Only purchase this book if you already know C and Perl, and have no knowledge of CGI.There are much better simple free tutorials online that could describe the basis of CGI.
1	The holy one is dethroned: God Dethroned's vocals can sometimes lack in quality, but their amzing riffs make up for any lost. This double-disc offers many quality black/death metal songs. Warkult is the song that i get hooked on the most. I suggest listening to them on the metal blade site before you buy it, just incase it isn't what you expected.
0	Boring in the extreme: I have persisted for far too long with this dreary, long winded novel and have decided to stop torturing myself in this worthless effort, and closed the book once and for all on page 460 of 896.I still do so reluctantly, as I cannot remember a book so bad that I could not finish it, by one means or another, either by 'skimming' or jumping ahead.For my 'two cents' worth, don't waste your time, unless you have lots and lots to spare and don't mind meandering around with Dorothea (and the provincials) as George Elliot tries to provide a 'study' of Provincial life.In fairness to others, perhaps if it is approached and read as a 'study', it could be bearable, perhaps even an interesting one - I feel sorry for any schoolchild who had this as a set-book!
0	Huge Disappointment!: Don't remember when I've been so let down, especially given the high level of praise from the reviewers I read before purchasing. Gave up in frustration after completing less than 25% of the book.What a sad collection of wordy FLUFF!
1	As classics go, it's pretty classic: Rarely have I enjoyed a classic with more surprise than Middlemarch. It looks to be an endless and boring morality tale from the plot summary, but reads like a work of high psychological art.The only other writer who has taken me so convincingly inside the thoughts of so many characters is Shakespeare. A strong compliment, but Eliot shows that she had the goods and somehow weaves an epic and beguilingly entertaining tale out of a quite depressing subject and period.I recall not wanting this book to end; for an 800-pager, that's strong praise indeed.They don't write 'em like this anymore!I love this Penguin edition; they've been doing it right for so long that their versions of the classics have all the right, simple touches.Truly great writing makes you feel ennobled for having read it; Middlemarch is most decidedly one of those books.
0	Contrive Hard!: An action-filled yet unsatisfying sequel to the1988 classic. Bruce Willis' engaging performance as the intrepid John McClane is weighed down by a contrived screenplay and lack of memorable villains. Filmmaker Renny Harlin would fare better in the stunt-filled Sylvester Stallone romp "Cliffhanger." Avoid "Die Hard 2" and proceed directly to "Die Hard With a Vengeance" (1995) - a superior follow-up that reunited Willis with original director John McTiernan.
1	Intriguing, Non Stop Reading: Once again, Kimberla Lawson Roby has out done herself! I thoroughly enjoyed this novel and would recommend it to anyone who wants a fiction novel that they CANNOT put down. Ms. Roby makes you want to read while youre sleeping to see the outcome of the story's plot. Although I could not put this book down, I did not want to see it end :( Ms. Roby, keep up the excellent work and please, continue to write fiction novels worth reading. Hope to see you at the African Spectrum Bookstore in Georgia again soon.
0	didn't like it.: I thought this book was slow and boring. The characters wre not well developed and I didn't like the author's writing style. The book was amateurishly written. I do not recommend this book.
1	Such an exciting and interesting book!: I recently finished reading " Casting The First Stone". This book was simply amazing. This was my first time reading a book by Kimberla Lawson Roby. I have seen her name around, but I never read one of her books before. I am a member of the Black Expressions book club, and that is where I ordered this book. Pastor Curtis Black was a trip and half. That man was so low down. I didn't think he could get any lower, but I was wrong. Although I enjoyed the book, it would've been nice to know why Curtis did all that cheating. The book could've used some background information on Curtis. But I must say that Kimberla has captured my interest, and now I'll be on the lookout for more of her books. I don't really have a favorite female author. I can read anything by anyone, be it male or female. But I will certainly be looking out for her. I'm about to let my sister read " Casting The First Stone". And I'll be starting Eric Jermome Dickey's " Liars Game"
1	I couldn't put it down to save my life!: Kim Roby has done it! this book is such a gripping look into one woman's pain filled struggle with her husband that just happens to be a man of the cloth. Man of the Flesh would have been more apporpriate. Tanya Black is an strong, successful woman with a husband that can't be faithful if he tried. This novel spins the web of decit, pain and plenty of get back. The writing is clear and vivid. I could see the emotion laced within the words and I could feel the pain, fear and faith of each character. Kim, you've done it. This is the first of your works that my bookclub has read, but with writing like this, IT WON'T BE THE LAST! The Eye of RA Bookclub.
0	Really?!? I have to have a PH-D and rank in the 90th Percentile in the GRE to learn and run A MVT test?: Honestly QualPro, Some of the stuff I really liked in the book. But as soon as you began to belittle my intelligence by telling me that I need to have a PHD in Stats, and rank in the 90 th percentile in the GRE. Then you lost most of my interest. Why don't you STOP belittling everyone else to sell your process. Lean and Six Sigma are all good. ANY processes that drives continuous improvement (including yours QualPro) is a good thing. Is yours better than everyone else's? who knows? BUT I do know that you don't need to bash ever other CIP process or method to make you feel good. Focus on what you are doing, and if it is good it will be accepted and used, but the fact that you feel like you have to bring down others to build yourself up is pathetic!
0	This Electric Youth Needs a Jolt: The art is the reason to purchase this, if indeed you do. Oeming works in black-and-white Mignola territory here. And occasionally the script spins a nice turn of phrase or matches up effectively with the pretty pictures, in spite of itself.But it tried to hard to be self-consciously arty and poetic. It was like an early Bradbury plot written in late prose, filtered through acid flashbacks -- lyrical but disjointed. I suppose one could argue that it was a success, if it was trying to be dreamlike, but in the light of day a dream still needs to make sense upon interpretation. And this didn't.Can I describe the story? Not so much. A bitter woman, a cuckolded husband, and a neglected daughter. Is she alive, or dead? Is she able to exert influence regardless? Was it a dream? A metaphor? Brought about by a horseshoe to the head? Or ended that way? Let me know if *you* can tell.Look for it in the quarter bin, maybe.
1	This is so kool: This is really great. There are 2 analog sticks and this thing vibrates!! That so kool. If you you don't want it to vibrate, you could turn it off in the option mode of the game. And it is compatable with all PlayStations!
0	Disappointed: I was really disappointed in this purchase. The music was not what I expected. It is not a good choice for a Yoga class. More disappointing is that I can't return it.
0	Dull attempt to ape Hitchcock's style: Highly stylized effort at film noir by Kenneth Branagh, matching the tortuously dull love-affair between his private-eye and Thompson's amnesiac with a cliche-ridden attempt at a genre he either misunderstands completely or must secretly loathe. Derek Jacobi is excellent as usual, and the plot does finally gather some pace, but by this time its a question of making the best of a bad job.
0	Buy the DVD for Branagh's Commentary: I thought the film was way over the top on mood and effects. It was a complete distraction from the characters and plot. I think it could have been much easier to watch if it had been filmed with1/2 the intensity. But the cast is wonderful and Branagh's commentary on the DVD gives great information about film making, the challenges to stage the scenes, and the process of refining the story. I will buy the DVD to get the commentary and will watch that much more than the film.
0	Boring....: Definitly one of their worst albums along with Rubber Soul and the overrated REVOLVER album. Skip it good.
1	Their Best: The Beatles released many fine albums during the 60s, but "Magical Mystery Tour" was their finest. There is not a single weak track on this record. The Beatles never released an album with as many #1 hits as "Magical Mystery," including "Penny Lane," "All You Need Is Love," and "Hello, Goodbye." The other songs aren't bad either. "Strawberry Fields Forever" is the best song John ever wrote, while the title track and "Fool On the Hill" are enough to make an album gold or platinum for another rock group. While the film was a colossal flop, the soundtrack shows psychedlic rock at its best.
1	Magical mystery tour... OH,BUT ITS TRUE!!!!!!!!!: Recently,a poll was taken as to which beatle songs were the best ever, and a bunch of them came from magical mystery tour.Oh,it sure is true,magical mystery tour rules!!!!!
0	Magical Mystery Tour: Horns, flutes, instrumentals and bad vocals. How can one resist? There are lots of descriptives of this album, but "masterpiece" isn't one of them.The title song starts off with potential, but fades quickly, and most of the rest of the record is pretty forgettable, especially Hello Goodbye, and All You Need is Love which sound very outdated.
0	Check the Track Listing: Flying, Blue Jay Way, Your Mother Should Know, Baby You're A Rich Man. Did the group just not try to write a complete album or were they out of ideas? The so-called better tracks, Penny Lane and Strawberry Fiels suffer from Paul's lightweight writing and John's nasally singing - "Straw Berry Fieeeelds For Eveh.."Ugh.Who knows, but it sure doesn't stand up to anything before or after its release. Anyone who rates this 5-stars is simply swept up in the Beatles. They can't be listening to the music.
1	The Best Pop Album Ever Made: Denizens of the Seattle area are long used to seeing me drive around on sunny days, windows open, playing Magical Mystery Tour in my car deck and singing the tunes at the top of my voice. The very apotheosis of Pop. How can you NOT like an album with songs like "Strawberry Fields", "Penny Lane", "I Am The Walrus", "Hello, Goodbye", "Blue Jay Way", and the anthem of the 60's, "All You Need Is Love"? Eh? God Save the British Empire!
1	Great movie about the disaster at Pearl Harbor: I have this movie on VHS and wanted a copy on DVD. This is a great movie.
1	The version: I Really like war movies and this is the definitive version of the attack on Pearl Harbor. The effects are great and the historical background are precise. It's superior to the recent Pearl Harbor film. This is the movie!
1	TORA! TORA! TORA! WINNWR WINNER! WINNER!: Great quality, arrived sooner than expected, great price. NO SHOPPING MALLS OR HUNTING FOR PARKING!!! I could just kick back and watch a favorite.
0	Buyer Beware: When I first purchased this vacuum I was very impressed with the ability it had to suck up pet hair. I have a cat and a dog and it seemed to work wonderfully at getting the hair out of the carpets. However, 9 months later the vacuum has become a piece of junk. It simply blows the dirt it "sucks up" right out the back side of the vacuum and back all over the area just vacuumed. I am not the only person experiencing this, I had recommend the vacuum to a friend that told me the other day he ended up so mad that he threw it out into his yard and went back to his 20 year old Kirby. And his machine is only about 6 months old. Since both of these units were purchased through Amazon, there seems to be no recourse on any type of return warranty coverage. The only thing that sucks with this vacuum is the fact that I paid $90 bucks for it!
1	So far it's great: I researched tons of vacuums before purchasing this one. I wanted the best I could get for around $100. This is the first time I've owned a bagless vacuum and I was a bit concerned that it would be messy to empty it. Turns out not to be a problem. Everything detaches easily. If you were to open it over the garbage and shake it out, then some of the dust will fly around cause of the shaking. I just set it in a plastic bag, open, and lift it up and everything comes out mess free in the bag. The automatic cord rewind thing was not a selling point for me when I purchased it, but now I don't ever want to own a vacuum without it - it's so convenient. I gave it four stars only because it is a little bit heavy, but not too much to be a problem for me.
1	A fantastic vacuum for the price!: I bought this vacuum four months ago and it works great! Easy to use and really seems very powerful. Picks up things from your carpet that you didn't even see. The push-button release for the dirt container makes it very simple to empty. This is an excellent vacuum for the price. I use about a mid-range height setting for my carpets and it works great.
1	Extremely pleased!: I was looking for a new vacuum for my apartment, so I did some research and read a lot of reviews about many different vacuums. After much hemming and hawing over which one would suit me, I decided upon this one and I was pleasantly surprised! This vacuum has really nice suction and it doesn't seem to lose that the longer the vacuuming session runs; it also really fluffs up the carpet. I have a dog and she does shed. This vacuum does a really good job at picking up the hair. I have been able to use the pet attachment tool and that works pretty well. Animal hair is stubborn anyway, so I needed a little patience to suck it all up and get those little hairs that were entwined with the fabric fibers. I am glad that I purchased this vacuum. One caution though, when you use the hose, the main agitator still runs. So, be careful what your vacuum is sitting on or you will have a worn spot on your carpet if you let the vacuum sit in one place for too long.
0	Stopped Working: I wonder if the same people who gave this vacumn high ratings would give the same rating after six months. Mine worked well for about six months and stopped working this past weekend. I had it cleaned out thoroughly and replaced the belt, but the power would not come on. My first thought was that the built-in Thermal Protector shut it down because of overheating. It should then reset itself after 30 minutes. Well...it's been two days....I would think that you would want your vacumn works longer than six months. If so, please consider another product that is not made by Hoover. Good Luck if you decided to give this a try because of other reviews.
0	worked once: i bought this 5 months ago -- it worked just fine out of the box ... the 2nd time i used it, it wouldn't pick up even a dried piece of a leaf, i could only get any pickup using the hose which is a back breaking process ... i've tried every setting on carpet and area rugs ... have finally decided it is a total waste of money. Folks - I so recommend you not purchase this.
0	Updated Feedback: I have updated my feedback for this product because the container cap fall off while I was removing the dust from the container. The part of the plastic connection that holds the cap was broken (opened it only a few times). Although I was able to close the container now, I am afarid to open it the next time.
0	Defective unit features: After about 2-3 months, I had problems with the extension tube's rotating brush head. The brush stopped rotating, meaning that it now simply gets in the way of airflow. And the main body takes two or three passes to get some very easy, lightweight things up. I also agree: it's bad to leave the thing running in one spot because it will friction damage your carpet, which is a bad flaw. So when you use the (badly designed) extension tube, watch out. Another problem: if you run one side of the main floor unit under a narrow rim, i.e. a cabinet, the main vac belt tends to come off. This cleaner needed more testing and was marketed too quickly.
1	economical and efficient: I thought at first that the vacuum was extremely hard to push until I realized that the lowest setting was for smooth floors rather than carpet. Once I adjusted the dial, the vacuum moved much more easily. It has great suction and picks up so much dirt and dog hair from my carpet that I'm embarrassed about my housekeeping. I really like being able to see in the clear cylinder what it's picking up from the floor, and it is very easy to empty the canister. The cord rewinder is excellent. The vacuum's a bit loud, but no more than most that I've had. It's definitely worth the money.
0	Junk: Wife bought this vacuum about a year ago. It has sucked since day1. Hate it. Piece of junk. Smells like burning rubber, no suction, belts burn out constantly (probably why it smells like it is on fire all the time), shoots dust particles into the atmosphere leading to increased global warming (o.k. kidding about the "contributes to global warming"). Wish this vacuum cleaner had never entered into my life. Avoid.
1	Hoover U55607-900 Elite Rewind Bagless Upright: This vacuum works great. It works so much better then expensive ones that I bought.The suction is awesome. It's not to heavy. Would recomend it to anyone who has athritis, because of how you can adjust the handle.
0	Absolute Junk: This vacuum is compete junk. After owning it less than it for a month my wife and I had it into the Hoover service center 4 times. The store technician said, in not so many words, that it was complete junk and they have nothing but problems with them. So when I asked about the warranty that I had officially registered through their website, the manager told me that the company had been restructured and that I should just purchase a better model. So when I ask to return the deffective product and get credit towards a better model, he informed me that the only credit would go towards the standard retail price and since they were already having a holiday sale, the credit he could giive me would not benefit me at all. I would recommend avoiding this model and Hoover's all togethr if possible. Their warranty is worthless and their service centers basically told us that since the product was junk to begin with, there isn't much that they could do for us.
0	A Headache of a Vacuum: The thing burned through belts. One time I replaced 2 belts in one vacuuming session--and yes I installed them properly and they weren't rubbing against anything.My guess is that it's the quality of the belts--or should I say lack of quality.Even after two years, the vacuum, when ran, would fill the house with a hot rubber smell.The tubes were also prone to clogging and I've had to pull it apart numerous times to push dust clogs through so it would work properly.After two years, the vacuum just stopped when the motor burned out. I did us a favor.The cord retractor was neat; at least they got that part right.
1	good product: I've used this hoover for one month and it works pretty well. Easy to use and all the parts work fine. The filters are effective. A little bit stiff and heavy, but I never had a big hoover like this, so it might be normal. It doesn't recline too much. I recommend it. Good deal for the price.
0	Broke after one year: I know that companies design (very cleverly) products to go bad after a certain amount of time, and sure enough, this Hoover did just that after1 year and 9 days. The motor overheated once last month (waited an hour and it reset) and then it just stopped sucking up anything soon thereafter (probably around 20% of what it once was capable of). Now it's time to move on to another brand... (MADE IN CHINA anyone?!)There should be a Class Action set up for us against ALL companies (& their products) with ANY parts made in China. Times have changed.
1	fuzzfree: I have newer carpet in my military housing home. And since it isn't the best of carpets we get alot of fuzz from it, even five months later. Our old vacuum, which was small, just wasn't cutting it so I decided to look for one on Amazon. When the vacuum came my husband and I were both happily suprised at the features. The dirt cup is great with a very clean release and we love the cord rewind feature too. Over all we're very happy with the purchase!
1	Fantastic Vacuum - Hoover: We brought this because of the reviews we read and they were right, it is a great vacuum and it is a bonus that it has a HEPA filter. We recently moved into a new apartment and my husband got very bad sinus in the new apartment, I think they may have had a cat there previously. Although the carpet looked clean I used the new Hoover on it and wow there was so much cat hair and dust it was amazing what it picked up and suddenly my husband no longer had sinus. It is easy to empty, the only down side is it is a bit heavy to push. It was also a great price on Amazon.
0	Wish I'd Read Reviews Before Buying: Purchased this vacuum just after Christmas, wish I'd read the reviews first. I'm 64 so I've had quite a few vacuums and this is the least user friendly one I've ever owned. The only thing good about it is the retractable cord. It doesn't pick up dog hair very well and after emptying, it's a pain to get back together. I'm taking it back to Target.
0	Poor Quality construction: I purchased this for my 7 year old. He is really in to hot Wheels. He is pretty good about being careful with his toys but with an hour of opening this new toy he was taping the doors back on. This product is very low quality. The wheels have fallen off the cars. I would avoid buying this.
1	Creative fun is good fun: This set combined with other sets, provides my son with hours of creative fun. I have found that to be able to build a variety of structures, it takes a total of about 350 pieces. So this was an addition to 2 other different sets already purchased.
1	yoga, meditation, massage music to enjoy while reading: My students love this CD in yoga class and I enjoy it also at home while reading or meditating with a lavendar candle burning. It really is a Healing to listen to.
1	Amazing and insightful: Beth Sipe writes about her exeperiences as a battered woman in this emotionally charged biography. She talks about the years of living with her abuser and raising her children in a home that was never without pain and abuse. She fights the legal system, mental health system, police, and military for support for years, but never gets the help with her situation without challenges.She tries to leave several times and even when she is able to get a restraining order, her husband violates it. Finally she is able to take no more and does something that will forever change her life and the life of her children.This is a must read for anyone working in domestic violence or for those who have lived with abuse and are on the road to recovery.
1	An Underappreciated Capra Classic: I love this movie. All of Frank Capra's films are great, but this is the one I like the most(this and YOU CAN'T TAKE IT WITH YOU). It's a wonderful story of a "woman of the street" trying to put on a good show for her daughter when she comes to visit(and introduce her fiance). It's a touching and funny film and goes sadly unheralded(at least Criterion released in on laserdisc). I often think of it in the same class with the Barbara Stanwyck classic, STELLA DALLAS. A must for any classic film fan, an absolute must.
1	WARREN AND MAY ARE GREAT!!!!!: I love this film, although I have to agree that the print suffers. I wouldn't be that concerned about it if it wasn't for Capra Jr. raving about it as much as he did. Overall his commentary is interesting although somewhat repetitive. "Lady For a Day" is a real classic and should have been on Criterion.
0	Broken!: We bought this as a birthday gift and when it was opened - it was broken inside the box. I am glad I also purchased a strobe light or the kids would have been so disappointed! And, instead of being able to exchange it - you can only return to amazon from this seller and there was no way to conact the seller to have them send us a working one.
0	A broken item was sent: I received a broken item from the seller. This is the first time I received an undesirable product from Amazon and I will think twice to order something in future.I needed that item for a special occation and somehow managed to glue the pieces. I did not return this item to the seller.Krish Mukhopadhyay
0	The reviews are true about the bulb!: Bought it for a small band gig we are gonna have. The package comes really secure and, as usual, amazon has been great with the shipping. The real problem I had was the bulb wasn't turning on THE FIRST TIME I tried it. The rotating ball is working so I figured out I just got a broken bulb. Bought a new bulb (bulb description at the bottom doesn't match the actual bulb you will need). Still wouldn't work. FML for throwing the box right away. Now I have this in my garage, useless
0	UNoriginal!!!: A straight guy who wants to have a female-dominant threesome? Let's see: this has already been done in "Trois" and "Just One Time." Just as those movies stunk, so does this one. This movie could have been called "The Look-alike Film." The main character looked like he could have been Brendan Fraser's fatter brother. The Spanish student was obviously a Penelope Cruz imitation. In fairness, one guy may have been the actual tattooed guy from "Oz," the one on death row.This film says it has "sexual content," but it could have run on non-cable TV. There is no nudity whatsoever. The plot is predictable. I am in shock that a movie whose cover looked so titillating could be such a disappointment. This work really and truly lacked redeeming qualities.
1	cheap price works well: thats all i can say about it. it fits my toyota 96 camry and it seems to be better than my previous gas cap
1	Awesome game: If you like action and great moves, then this is your game. The game is entertaining and definitely worth the money. I would recommend this game to all who love fighting games.
1	not perfect: The lastest chapter is not good. The style is Different with above. Look like other author write it.
1	Good but wordy: It is a good book for you to pass SCBCD. All content focuses on exam objectives. However, I didn't give it 5 stars because it is too wordy. Some people might love the book since it makes them smile. But if your goal is only to pass SCBCD, the wordy content is useless and wastes your time.Anyway, I passed SCBCD with 91% by using this book.

0	Buy the book instead: I know, I know. A book and a video are two different art forms and you shouldn't compare them to each other. But after reading the utterly hilarious book based on this series, the actual video was a disappointment. Slow and boring describe it best. Natually the video can't introduce Root's interior dialogues, so we're left with minimal dialogue. Also, some episodes (in the book with pictures) were apparently edited out of the video. Too bad -they were hilarious. Stick to the printed word on this one if you want hysterically cutting British sarcasm.
0	Comments on Crowd Madness: Was disappointed that so much of the original book was left out in order to focus on investor psychology. MacKay was a master of crowd psychology in its many forms, in addition to investment matters.
1	Informative and interesting - Maybe not for a beginner: I really enjoyed this book. Written in the1950s, is has an interesting view of the1920s through the lens of a post-war intellectual. Giving evenhanded accounts of Wilson, the Roosevelts, Smith, McAdoo, Coolidge, Hoover, and other major players of the period, the author manages to critically analyze the era leading up to the depression without condemning it in broad strokes.Leuchtenburg does a particularly good job of defending Hoover as a capable and intelligent man with little tolerance for playing politics and an incredibly poorly dealt hand dealt to him. He is also critical of the often beautified TR.The Perils of Prosperity is a worthy read for anyone interested in the social and political machinations of the early 20th century.
1	A great second volume: As of always Norman Geisler pumps out another book , which is very clear and sharp on the doctrines of God and the origins of creation.This book and also with his first volume is a must for all theological thinkers.I cant wait until his next volume comes out. Does any one know how many volumes there will be ?.
0	Curious about this book!: I am curious to read this book it sounds inspiring. It is really nice to hear a story about someone who recovered from tragedy. I too am skeptical about the idea of dialysis to treat or overcome schizophrenia. I think it does a bit of a disservice to people with serious mental illness who have to take or often refuse medication with difficult side effects to advocate an experimental and risky "cure" with no significant treatment outcomes but it's a definite read.
1	Travel Prep for Italy.: I checked this out to get more background before a trip to Italy. I am going to recommend it for a young (middle school) friend in anticipation of future travel.I appreciate things more if I know why it is so special. I can imagine this age group could be pretty bored if they don't "get" why this stuff is so special & they'd rather be home with their video games. Donatello is more than a turtle with attitude.
0	Komplete Mess: This is a TERRIBLE version of Mortal Kombat 4! The graphics are awful,the sound and music is ear aching,and the gameplay is beyond hideous.This plays just like MK3 did on the gameboy...like total krap! Actually,it may even be worse than MK3! Avoid this at all costs!
0	What planet am I on?: What planet am I on.....isn't this earth? I have to check because I recently saw a terribly boring and vastly overrated movie called Dreamgirls. You would think from all the hype this movie got it would have been the best musical since the Wizard Of Oz! Instead what I saw was another example of a bunch of snob critics trying to sell me a chocolate covered lemon. I won't criticise each aspect because there isn't anymore time left to spend on this waste of a good two hours of time. Jennifer Hudson.....an Oscar.....for this.....FOGGEDDABBOUDDIT. And just when you thought Grease 2 was as bad as it gets. This is worse!
0	Not at all what I expected: No disrespect to Ms. Jennifer Hudson, but this was the worst thing I have tried to watch in a long, long time. It was a valiant effort but sometimes you just wanted to scream as it went on and on and on and on. This would have been so much better as a movie and not a musical. It just was not very good to me as I tried to watch it. I had to finally turn it off about 3/4 of the way through it. JMHO and no disrespect intended.
0	It does have a story, sort of: Repetitious. I lasted one hour watching this before I left the room. My spouse was able to watch it to the end and enjoy the story underneath.I gave Moulin Rouge one star, partly because of the shrill grating voices. At least Dream Girls has more natural voices. And it was fun to see how different performers of the era were represented by these fictional characters. And there was at least one educational piece of historical information: Elvis was not the original singer for Hound Dog. It was Big Mama Thornton, but her version was suppressed by mainstream white radio.
0	Ouch: So I decided since eveything was in such a hype of dreamgirls I would watch it.Bad idea. Has anyone ever seen movies like Cabaret or hell even Sound of Music?That is how you do a musical, not some horrible cheesefest of actors. I don't know about anyone else, but I am really tired of Jamie Foxx and his horrible attitude towards almost anything. By the time this movie started to get an interesting plot it was almost over, and the music wasn't even that catchy at all.It was annoying after awhile, actually. I enjoyed this movie when they weren't singing, but it was just painful when they were.Also it was extremely perdictable. I knew what was going to happen before it did, which makes it boring to watch.The only reason it is getting any stars at all is because of Eddie Murphy and when they weren't singing.
0	Boring: This movie is totally boring. There is no plot. I am glad I just rented it from the local library.
0	NightmareGirls: At about the 90 minute mark, I felt that my nightmare was just about over. I then remembered that there was about 40 minutes left to this string of cliches. I plan to start a12-step recovery group for myself and others who have been traumatized by this travesty. What was so bad about it? Only the writing/acting/music/period-detail/directing...everything else was pretty good.
1	"Dreamsgirls "- A Dream Movie!: "Dreamgirls" is an absolutely outstanding adaptation of the stage production. Jennifer Hudson absolutely shines. This is the first movie I have seen in many, many years where an audience was moved to cheer and applaud. During Jennifer's rendition of "I am Telling You", the audience responded as if we were at a live concert. "Dreamgirls" is a treat and an absolute delight. The acting, the singing, the musical score and the costumes are all award-winning calabre. I congratulate a great cast on their wonderful performance.
1	Best dvd edition ever: This edition is worth the price. A 3rd disc which is a Target Exclusive features: "One Night Only" dance remix video (4 mins.) I luv the remix video. It's Faboulus!!!!
0	Totally blah: This was a very uninteresting waste of time. Thank goodness C. S. Forrester wrote other novels; I would never have bought any of his novels if I had read this thing first.
0	First greek zombie flick ever...: Evil is the first ever greek horror film which deals with...zombies and because i'm a zombie fan and also a greek u can imagine my happiness when i heard about this movie so i went straight and watched it in a greek theater with many expectations but unfortunately although it was a nice try it had nothing to do with the superb romero series and it suffered with the disease that all greek productions are suffering. The lack of experienced actors but that's another topic.Anyways, if u are a zombie fan check this out BUT i warn you u will be tired as time passes by.There are some good scenes like the last one with the soccer field but that won't save the movie.A Cult movie because it's the first ever greek zombie flick but it will never be a classic one.
1	Like a drug you take by listening: This music is incredibly relaxing. I have never listened to anything that helps me chill and think like this cd does. It leveled my thinking to a pace where I wasn't slow, but at the same time wasn't racing through ideas too fast to properly consider them. It is like a drug that is taken auditorily, by listening to it, and the effect is clarity of mind, calming of the spirit, and lucidity into one's life.
0	Nice retrospective... but not too informative: Author rambles on about various old designs and the philosophies of the designers/builders, interspersing a few fuzzy B&W pictures and snippets of hull profiles. Might be interesting to the history buff, but if you want clear, relevant information on how to build a wooden boat... this book isn't for you. There are many others to choose from - I'd recommend Buehler's Backyard Boat Building and Gerr's Strength of Boats as two helpful books I've read so far.
0	Not For Those Who Wish To Build Boats: The book is filled with stories about boats, not about boat building techniques or anything really of use to someone who is interested in building plywood boats, buyer beware! This title is misleading.
1	good purchase: Thank you very much! I Recommend mixing this with apple juice, mango, banana and ice. Almond milk and banana is good too. I don't recommend it with berries, although the Macro reds might go well with them. Purchase a personal blender and your good to go!
1	Actually Awesome: For any product to actually make a difference in my physical well-being, I most certainly feel I owe a review. The actual ingredients would be good for anyone, but particularly helpful for one with low energy problems and difficulty eating all the fruit and vegetable servings recommended in our Food Pyramid (which I DO believe in). Also I am super caffeine sensitive and was relieved that the small amount of it in the green tea component didn't phase me in the least, i.e. no shakes. In total I simply have more energy that feels organic and am also calm because I feel better!
0	Excess Sweetness and Filler: What an overpriced disappointment. All I taste is excess sweetness from Stevia. Why are almost all green formulas sweetened? Either you want the greens or not, but don't change the taste with a sweetener.It's also loaded with Lecithin, an inexpensive soy by-product used as a filler and promoted as something good.... it's not.The only greens formula I know without sweeteners and fillers is Garden of Life Perfect Food, the Original Formula. Better yet, make your own green powders from Barley or Wheat grass, Chlorella, Spirulina, and Alfalfa powder from NOW Foods .
1	Awesome piano trio jazz: On this disc Kenny teams up with two other heavyweights, Charlie Haden and Roy Haynes. These fellows are no strangers to piano trios and this disc illustrates why. There are a variety of cuts from the lyrical Billy Strayhorn Passion Flower to some very aggressive modal jazz such as Madman. You hear some wonderful improvisation and the interplay between these gentlemen is wonderful to listen to. I have to say that their reading of Passion Flower ranks at the top of my list. Kenny really shows his dexterity in a very lyrical way. In the end it is the Bop influences that make this such interesting music to listen to. This disc is trio jazz at its finest.
1	Never Cry Wolf: Amazing True Story of Life Among Artic Wolves: You'll laugh and you'll cry at the early adventures of this real life naturalist. Farley Mowat's writing is a joy to read, his words conjure up pictures in your mind and keep you turning the pages. Then you'll remember that there was a movie by the same title and you'll rent the CD which will also not disappoint you. After that, you'll want to know more about Mowat, his remarkable childhood and how he became the person he is today.
1	Wolf Behavior: Interesting and Entertaining: This book is a quick and enjoyable read that will dispel some myths about wolves. The author traveled to a remote are of northern Canada in the summer of1948 to study wolves, which were supposedly destroying the caribou population. The actual culprit turned out to be human hunters. His sympathetic descriptions probably didn't do much for his career with the Canadian government, but may have changed some minds about the threat that wolves pose to people.Excellent descriptions of wolf behavior in their natural habitat, including the interaction of an immediate family with pups and various groups that live in adjacent territories. Some of the behaviors he observed had not been seen before by scientists, and he was accused of fabricating them, but most of these observations have since been verified by others.At times, Mowat could be accused of attributing human motivations to animal behaviors. If this bothers you, you many not fully enjoy this book.
1	Which version to get?: Well, I've read the reviews here and couldn't do any better. Also, I suggest you read Roger Ebert's take on this wonderful film. A must see for fans of Japanese cinema and for anyone who appreciates cinema as an art-form and not just entertainment.I own both the Milestone release and the Asmik release (got via Amazon.co.jp). I agree with [...] - the transfer and the director's cut/extras found on the Japanese Asmik version are far superior than Milestone's (and far cheaper). Try to find the Japanese version if you can. I'd be selling my Milestone version *to get rid of it* but I let my sister have it. Four and1/2 stars.
1	Hypnotic: A quiet, surreal, psychological horror story. There is much to contemplate in this tale of an entomologist, the woman with whom he is imprisoned, and the savage villagers who derive both their livelihood and a twisted sense of pleasure from the couple's predicament. It says much about the ambivalence that many Japanese feel toward society: on one hand, they feel a sense of obligation to sublimate their own needs to those of the group; on the other, there is a deep sense of resentment and a feeling that they are not properly appreciated for their sacrifices. The only flaw with this film is that it sometimes belabors the point.
0	What was i thinking?: I bought this game because it seemed like a pretty cool product. I was wrong! This game is not thrilling and it just doesn't seem to have a point. What were they thinking when they made this game? I sold mine because it was just useless to me. I didn't get very much but anything was better than keeping it around.
1	Lyrical prose. Masterfully told.: The reason why it is so important to pay attention to description is because Richter uses nearly every detail to help tell the story. The prose is evocative in the tradition of some of the best modernist writing at the time like Willa Cather. Despite the occasional misplaced modifier, Sea of Grass is definitely a book that deserves a close reading--if only for Richter's poetic prose that makes you want to read out loud.
1	Just what I expected: Everything about the purchase was good and the meter is just what I expected. I have had cheap meters before and am thrilled with the upgrade.
0	Great visual, poor plot: Nothing much happens in this movie. The movie moves so slow,106 minutes feel like 4 hours. Of the106 minutes, 90 are merely scenes of the African landscape accompanied by music. Yes, it is beautiful but I'd rather have a storyline.The social and sexual tensions are barely explored, they are barely grazed, merely hinted at. I fast forwarded through half the movie, hoping to stumble upon a good scene that never came. Slow moving, tediously boring and with a plot that is never explored. The racial relations are purely explored. We get more exploration of racial and sexual relations in "Growing Pains - The Complete First Season" PLUS a message of the week!
0	A Lite Alternative: Songs like "Follow My Way", "Can't Change Me" and "Flutter Girl" are admittedly catchy. Cornell's voice is strong throughout. But, ultimately, this is coming-out music for someone who just bought their first grunge clothes at JC Penney.
1	I wanted a LITTLE more Soundgarden: I'm a more recent Soundgarden fan, but also a fan of Zeppelin, good vocals, good songwriting, and interesting guitar work. This album does not rock in a Soundgarden sense, and is more laid back.Still, the songwriting, guitar and especially Chris' talented pipes really make this an excellent album apart from his former band. He really is one of the best singers in rock, ever, and that fact really stands out solidly here.
0	Wow... this is one awful CD: I was hoping to be blown away by Mr. Cornell's cannon of a voice, but instead found myself falling asleep to uninspired lyrics and down right awful music. All you have to do is look at the pictures of Chris in the booklet to realize this Knight of the Soundtable has lost his way. Avoid this one like the plague.
0	best of his solo efforts and that's not saying much: This is the best Cornell solo effort and thats not saying a lot. Try out his AudioSlave or Soundgarden stuff it's amazing but this is bland and soulless like his Scream album.
0	How can anyone take this seriously?: Lyrically, Cornell sounds like a sub-literate14 year old scribbling deep thoughts in a spiral notebook: hideous. And the music sounds like it was lifted from a bunch of mid 70s Foreigner out-takes: bland, canned guitar rock. So he's got a big-time voice? So what? I can't believe people like this dreck.
1	Cornell shines in Euphoria Morning: Now you see why Soundgarden really broke up. Cornells' music was going in a different direction from the band. After a long wait, the front man of Soundgarden has realeased a good album, and promptly thanks his Soundgarden family many times. Euphoria Morning is best when played all the way through, and is a great pick up for all Soundgarden fans. The one possible draw back is the ommison of the single Sunshower, from the Great Expectation soundtrack.
1	Euphoria Morning Glory: One of the best CD's I have ever heard! Chris is so unique with his singing and compositions, you'll just be amazed, especially if you're playing guitar like I do.I can't wait until his next album...
1	Awesome CD: This was a great solo debut for Chris Cornell. I still cant believe that people are comparing it to Soundgarden, though. IT WAS NOT INTENDED TO BE SOUNDGARDEN. Somebody actually started bashing it because it wasnt like Badmotorfinger. There was noticable change from Screaming Life and FOPP to Badmotorfinger, then change from there to Superunknown, and then further change to Down on the Upside. Why in the heck would you think this album would sound like Badmotorfinger. I love the growth his music has taken. Great Job.
1	oh honey, it's been so long.: Oh, Chris, darling. It's been too long. It is so good to hear your lovely, chills-inspiring voice again. The music, the voice, the background singers...oh how they make me realize how much I've missed you. It's better than gospel. It's Chris.
1	Chris Evolves With Spectacular Results: I was a moderate Soundgarden fan, swept up in the power and bombast of the Seattle sound as a young twenty something when Superunknown came out.This, however, is a bold, unexpected, and100% satisfying departure from that style. The songwriting is varied, crafty and melodic, reminiscient of the Beatles and (and I know this is blashemous) early, early Billy Joel. There isn't a power chord on the whole record, and yet it's still powerful and emotionally charged. It, for lack of a headier word, rocks. A velvet-wrapped sledgehammer.The arrangements are off-kilter and not so radio-friendly. But the songs are irresistable. And the singing is...damn! can that man sing. Thirteen Bucks well spent.
1	Really Good Album that doesn't rip-off Cornell's past...: This is a really good album that manages not too sound like Soundgarden. In fact, if your looking for that, you might as well go play "Superunknown" a few more times. Cornell rarely moves into his "grunge" wail, and instead keeps everything less visceral than his former bandmates. Very Beatle-y circa '67. Solid musicianship and great lyrics, too. Cornell is a long-term player whether Soundgarden fans like this or not.
0	will not work: I have a high end sony blu-ray player, and for some reason this is the only blu-ray that will not play at all and yes I have a network conection. This blu-ray has no scraches either.
1	The Longest Day: A wonderful classic, war movie. They don't make movies like this anymore nor do they have great actors like those in this movie. This is why I buy the older movies. Most remakes are horrid and the actors are worse.
0	gkardd: Don't waste your $ - it wasn't worth buying the blu-ray version. I should have rented the dvd first before spending the blu-ray version.
1	Water Conditioner: This product has been excellent for dosing when performing water changes. Subsequent to its use we have found that our corals "bloom" as full as possible and appear to be at their healthiest. Even thought we produce R/O water using a high end filter with four cartridges including resin and deionization, adding this product to the R/O water when performing water changes seems to improve water quality.Also, when I look at my tank and see my corals are not looking as healthy as I would like, adding this product at the recommended doses produces immediate results and within ten minutes we see a substantial improvement in the look of our corals.
1	what a voice: It's old fashioned and has the fun sweetness of something we no longer have as much......innocence.
0	Bad.: Although I usually enjoy Ashanti's music, I'd have to say her single "Happy" holds a spot as one of her worst songs. It has a slow boring beat and airy, echoing vocals. It samples Gap Band's "Outstanding", but oh well, what do you expect? Also, this single also includes "Call", her album's WORST track. Please, for your own good, skip this.
1	Interesting, atmospheric mystery debut: Hollywood,1941. Screenwriter Keith Moody is about to hit the big time with the dramatization of his cousin's heroic war exploits. Greg Matthew's first mystery is a chronicle of Moody's experience, chock full of quirky humor, nasty characters and implausable plot twists. Its satirical depiction of the movie biz, our weak but willing hero's Faustian dilemma, and a unique love interest are presented in a narrative that soars above the messy plot, creating a portrait of a corrupt and totally fascinating world, as Far From Heaven as possible. Weird and wonderful--I LOVED it
1	Good Sci-Fi flick!: Although I might not go into great detail, I just want to say- I rented this movie, but wish I had it on dvd (my own collection) I thought the storyline was decent and had a surprise or two in it. I like the last person on Earth subject (scary-to say the least) I would say, if you arent sure you want to buy it---its as simple to just rent it. I am glad I took the time to watch it!
1	Quiet Earth and Quiet Film: I liked the quietness of the film and the simple idea behind the premise of the sci-fi story. It's neat to know that Kiwis seem to have a sense of humor even if they were the last people on Earth and take things somewhat in stride. So this film is a little different and underdramatic but has a neat perspective.What I couldn't get over were the ghastley clothes from the 80s. Strange, I know. Three people are the le last o exist on the Earth and I worry about their attire.A film that's different and low key but well acted.
1	The Quiet Earth: Great movie that arrived in perfect condition and played perfectly as well. I would recommend purchasing for this seller at any time.Cheers,Scott
0	The Quiet Earth: Waking up and finding himself alone, with no explanation then, finding out it was his own research companies fault, then finding and falling for the only ...fortunatley YOUNG girl in New Zealand, then finding another bloke, a big young Maori, she changes horses. Being the only 3 alive they sort of stay friends. All very odd, Anyway, the original bloke works out the Apoclypse is going to happen again, But finding out they were alive because they all were in the process of dying, the previous time, they decide to try and kill themselves again, but how, when, where (yawn: why ?) so very drawn out about nothing much.
0	Do Not Waste Your Money Like I Did.: I hated it. I watched it the day I got from Amazon (great service-no fault there) and threw it in the garbage after a lame viewing. My first clue should have been the "winner of 8 New Zealand Academy Awards" banner. As with most PC movies this one involves, as it's climax, inter-racial sex between a red head and a native New Zealander. If you're not into that sort of thing, don't buy it. This has little to do with "end of the world" type action, and more of "Panic in year Zero meets Jungle Fever" type crap. Save your money.
1	Leisurely read: I liked the book Inspector Iminishi Investigates, a leisurely story that is buttressed by the Japanese setting. A large part of my satisfaction was the authentic seeming police procedural. I believe that a Japanese police force would work in this way as opposed to the 48 hours mentality of police in our country,i.e. most crimes are solved in the first 48 hours.I was able to put the book down and would go back to it which is pretty much how I judge a book. Some I can't put down at all hence the 4 stars.
1	Selleck Continues as the Modern John Wayne: Tom Selleck is one of two current western actors who continue the realism of the "old west" western actors in the mold of John Wayne and others. Westerns in todays age are an "acquired taste". Selleck is a natural and in this tale he continues his best efforts as he did in the Sacketts, Quigley Down Under, and the other great Westerns he's excelled in. The story has a character of realism like all the Louis Lamour classics and Selleck portrays the hero in respect to the writers intent to picture the real Old West. Virginia Madsen is an unusual selection for the heroine, but she carries off the role and doesn't detract from the plot. Wilford Brimley again demonstrates his dynamic talents as a great character actor - an unusual role for him but he adds credibility to the plot. And Mark Harmon gives honest credibility to the villian's role of all great westerns. For the Westerns movie buff, another Selleck success is a great addition to one's collection.
1	Powerful and efficient: This product is more durable and powerful than the B&D version. It has one housing with battery with inter-changeable blades where the B&D is two seperate houseings with non-inter-changeable blades. I have had this company's grass shears before and would definitely buy this brand again.
0	powerless cutter: I purchased this grass cutter to trim a small area around my sons grave which takes about five minutes. when I first received this item it worked fine. Now after the battery is fully charged it does not last more than a minutes. I have wanted to return it because it has it has a lifetime guarantee please let me know how to get a replacement
0	poor life cycle - not a smart buy: We bought this in 4/09 and gave it VERY moderate use. We have little trimming but the product looked like a good buy. Initial use was impressive with good battery life that was always kept recharged. it was never exposed to wet conditions and never used inappropriately.We did buy an extension handle that did not work because the plastic electrical connection was misaligned. We returned that one and asked for another, only to find the same misalignment, so we gave up on the handle idea.We have kept this equipment immaculately clean amd stored in moderate temps.Now (3/10) we have a dead battery that cannot be charged. The service / support has been turfed to a third party that is only interested in selling replacement parts.I'm unwilling to spend any more $$ on what appears to be a great idea gone very wrong.RECOMMENDATON: Don't buy. Look elsewhere.
0	Worth equal to toilet paper: do you want a summary of this book?Stupid kid: "Hey Mr. Manager, how about you teach me some managing stuff to manage people"Manager:"you want me to teach you some managing stuff to manage people with"?Stupid kid: "yeah i want you to teach me some managing stuff, to manage people with"Manager: "allright, ill teach you some managing stuff to manage people with"Stupid kid: "you mean to tell me you'd teach me some managing stuff to manage people with"?Manager: "i dont like repeating stuff, ill show you some managing stuff to manage people with"*repeat thought out the whole bookif you are in idiot and you think books like rich dad poor dad are good books, then prepare for a heart warming storyif not, dont waste your time like i did, this bs could have been written in a greeting card
0	Not a big deal!: Another business book from bestseller list. Does it really help your vision? I do not think so. It is simple, well written, easy to read book. But, I did not get anything from it. If you have really have time, go ahead and read it. By the way, it takes only 45 minutes to finish it.
1	Worth more than One Minute: A little oversimplified and repetitive, but still a classic management book. Every leader should read this. Its concepts are so simple, and yet, there are so many managers in the world who remain ignorant of them! I wish every boss and senior colleague I have ever had, have, and will have would read this book.
1	For the real manager.: This book is for the real manager who is looking for ways to improve efficiency, and just the overall attitude of a company or corporation..
1	Clifford's First Valentine's Day Was Great!: Cliffords first Valentine's Day is a good book. It is best for kids the age of 4-6 because it uses small words. It is also easy for the children to comprehend. Clifford jumps into the mail cart and gets lost in the mail. I would recommend this book to any children interested in books. It is a good book.
1	Grandmas Bliss: I love all the books by Debbie Bliss. Lots of patterns and Ideas. If you love her yarn you will love the books too.
0	Cannot even compare to the book!: Terrible, terrible, just terrible! Ms. Isaacs, how can you letthem do this to your marvelous book! The plot, the actors justbutchered it. And don't even mention that Melanie Griffith. Linda Voss is supposed to be this confident, working girl but instead she made her out to be this wimpy, whispery-voiced wishy-washy sort of girl. Okay here is my advice. If you want to enjoy this movie, see it first then read the book by Susan Isaacs. You should look it up on Amazon too and see how highly it is recommended. I read it first and the movie was an unmitigated failure and disappointment to me. I could just cry thinking about it. I really wish they would make another movie out of it, but this time do it right and just follow the book which is just too perfect and which one cannot go wrong in following. Okay enough talk, read the book, forget the movie.
1	The Shining: I'm a sucker for a wonderful love story and I love watching movies with history to it and it takes place when I was born.
1	SPY, SUSPENSE, THRILLER, AND FABULOUS LOVE INTEREST: A love affair between an American spy and his secretary During WW2 is taken to Germany behind enemy lines when German scientists are suspected of developing a very destructive bomb. A Fabulous romantic love story with great actors, a fantastic background sceneries and great costumes. A very enjoyable movie.The quality of the DVD is good. One minus though, this DVD comes almost without any additional features.
0	Worst. Economics. Text. Ever.: This really is the worst Economics textbook I have ever encountered. This 466-page soft cover text is absolutely miserable, both in terms of clarity and organization. In addition, many fundamental concepts are not present in the text - the author cites them as "beyond the scope of this book." The book even resorts to bad grammer and poor editing in places. The level of incompetence on the part of the text's author is truly astonishing.
1	Pretty Darn Good: I normaly spend my time cringing at the writing of computer science authors. This book is fairly straight forward. It skips a beat here and there, but not so much that it stops one dead in the tracks. It is an exhaustive read and only on the basics. I thought that more depth is eventually needed when Cocoon gets finalized, but this is about as good as it gets right now.
0	Tuner Technology: Analog: This shows up under digital ... but if you look closer it reads ... Tuner Technology: Analog
0	Tasteless and pathetic: A little too much graphic sex and too little romance. I am a romance writer and definetly no prude but there's a fine line between vulgar and tasteful. This story is just plain vulgar. It's like Penny Jordan couldn't find anything else for the characters to do so she just writes a lot of smut until Julia gets knocked up and Silas admits he loves her. The gist I also got from this story is that they're distant relatives, grossness! Plus Silas is egotistical and way too pushy. There's nothing wrong with being a modern day girl who enjoys sex but Julia just sounds like a sl*t instead of a likable heroine. Want a better read with tasteful sex scenes? Then read Fugitive Fiancee by Kristin Gabriel or Father by Choice by M.J. Rodgers or the Wedding Planners trilogy by Darcy Maguire. They're written better without a lot of smut like this book!
0	May I use your Umbrella?: ....those of you who have seen this movie will get my title. I think the Umbrella scene was just fantastic! In this sequel, we are following the path of the younger brother of the killer in the first movie. Which is a very good B movie, it was even picketed for it content..you know a movie is good if people wanna get rid of it. Anyways, so we have Eric Freeman playing the younger brother, haunted by flash backs from the first movie (which this movie has alot of flashbacks), he begins a rein of terror in a santa claus suit, as did his brother. all the b movie elements are evident here. bad acting, nudity, sex, killing, blood, etc. I recommend this movie to anyone that has seen the1st one. The 3rd isn't bad either. Stop there. 4 and 5 have nothing to do with the first 3.
0	BAD MOVIE: My friend and i were looking for a bad horror movie, and we found it. First of all, it was 50% the first film, which is strange because in our video store it's labled that you must be18 to rent it and we're younger than that and we rented this one. The story is stupid. PLEASE! santa? The writhers of this must have been high or something when they wrote this.
0	Awful: This book just isn't worth it. Whether one is or is not an Imus fan, he is a fascinating subject for a biography. But this book is basically a rehash of things that have been said or written elsewhere. It has a number of out-of-date references, has nothing but dated pictures from more than ten years ago, and has factually inaccuracies and misspellings. Sorry, but don't waste your time or money.
0	IMUS. AMERICA'S COWBOY: This is a very poorly written book. The author comes across as being too smart by half. For instance she writes of a radio station XELO out of Del Rio, Texas that had an early influence on Imus. She goes on to explain that the station got around FCC transmitter power limitations by locating the transmitter in Juarez. If she had checked her geography she would have noted that Juarez is about 400 miles from Del Rio and the transmitter was actually located across the Rio Grande from Del Rio in what was then called Villa Cuna.She goes on to tell of Imus and his friends doing parodies on a con man named Billy Sol Estes, whom she writes was involved in a salad oil scam, when in fact it was chattle mortages on fertilizer tanks.This may seem like nit picking but given these inaccuracies how does one accept the rest of this book, or any of her other books as being factual?She does give some insights into Imus's character and background that are interesting.....if true.
0	Huge problem with this book!: There is one huge problem with the premise of this book and that is that MARY DOES NOT HAVE GRANDCHILDREN. She is ever-virgin and has only birthed Jesus, God's son. Jesus never married or had children, so how could Mary have a grandchild? When I see books like this that get past publishers (Christian ones, to boot!), I have to wonder where this world headed.
1	Most Relaxing: My husband bought this CD for me many years ago...copyright date1993. After14 years of listening, I still find it to be one of the most calming, relaxing CD's I own. Listening to it (especially with earphones/surround sound) transports me out of a mood of stress-related irritability into a world of tranquility and relaxation.
0	The Digital Caliper Did not work!: I am very disatisfied! I purchased this as a Christmas present. We got a call 2 days later saying it did not work! I tried to contact Apex Tools and they never returned my calls! Now I am stuck with a product that does not work and that I cannot return because no one has returned my call!
1	Nice for the price: Really nice quality for the price. Nice case for storage and protection when not in use. Easy to use and the spare battery is a nice bonus.
1	Digital calipers: Good quality calipers with digital readout at a terrific price. Very useful measuring device for my wood shop.
1	Good Tool Low Price: This is a great tool! it is quite accurate for a low price. not much more to say
0	Worth what you pay for it - no more!: If you think there's some magic and you're getting a precision digital caliper for $9, think again. This is a steel ruler that happens to have a digital readout. I guess the precision would be enough for some applications (e.g., wood carpentry) but I would not recommend it for precision mechanical or electronic applications. In particular, the depth gauge feeler on mine was slightly bowed and did not fit precisely in the guides for it, making accurate measurements with it impossible. Lesson learned, I'm coughing up $85
1	Great condition: Another book with which I was very pleased with its condition. It also came in the time allowed for. I was very pleased.
1	Wonderful Period Piece: Most of us know the story of The Legend of Sleepy Hollow - likely through Disney's well-crafted and true to the original adaptation of this Washington Irving classic, but it is worth the effort to explore the original. It is wonderfully written and contains a good deal of period language that has dropped out of our vernacular. The book is a quick read, with vibrant descriptions of colonial life in upstate New York.I recommend reading in the early fall, with a good scotch and a roaring fire.
0	I'm done with this show....: I used to love this show, but it's just too ridiculous now. This season we've only watched so we could see how Ted meets the kids' mother.... But I just don't care any more.Security pulls guns on Barney at the airport but he has no reaction? Barney's apartment is decorated like a Hello Kitty fanatic's place? How stupid.I haven't laughed with this show for a LONG time.
0	Please send me the product: Many weeks ago I bought this product and it is not shiped yet, when you will send it to me?
1	Having fun watching it: I love it. the story is interesting, each character has his/her own personality. Unpredictable development of the story. i really enjoy it.
0	naked truth: I was not trying to buy this because I already bought the entire season. I just could not get it to play so I think I ended up paying again.
0	still waiting: I think one have to be very passionated about the delivery time, even if I was warned for the late delivery.Now it takes "TO" long waiting. I'm afraid I never will receive this product. What about my payment I already did do long time ago. I only hope the Amazon seller "KRUSHCO WRESTLING" will not run away with my money without delivering.
1	Captured Live!!: NRBQ have released a few live recordings but this one seems to capture the band's comraderie. They are having fun and so is the audience. Everything seems spontaneous yet well coordinated. They are a fun, cohesive band. This disc is a blast! I've worn out my cassette and am purchasing the CD!! Thanks Uncle Q!
0	bad: i dont like to read books but i will read a book that gets my attention and when i started reading this book i hated it this book was very boring and uninteresting and just dull nothing interesting happened. the main girls sister had diabetes then shes hospitalized because she doesnt want to do what she has to then they get a new house guest who tells the girl about the pirate queen and the dad isnt around much in the book but thats not really anything interesting because the way it was written it just didnt get my attention at all.written by courtnee E.
0	Total Waste: This is one of the greatest wastes of talent I've seen in some time - and I've seen some stinkers. Why Caan and Powers accepted this script is beyond me but at least they survived its embarrassment and went on to much greater things. I can forgive a lot in a Western and can avoid the others but this one should just quietly be forgotten.
1	You need to give this one some time. Rewards will come.: The first time I heard this I thought I'd finally found it. A truly unworthy Robert Pollard/GBV release. The first impression you'll get is "where's the tunes, Bob?". Songs begin with odd a capella chants, strange vocals and weird conversations. But after quite a few repeated listenings you will find what you love about Bob which is a truly masterful grasp of the joy of pop music. This time Bob has thrown us for a loop but songs like In the House of Charles Augustus, Red Ink Superman, and Harrison Adams finally shine through and give you "that feeling" you get when you discover a Bob gem.
1	The Offical All My Children Trivia Book: I bought this book because my FAVORITE show was taken off. It is a great collector book for people like me. It contained things that I had forgotten about even though I had watched the show for 40 years.
0	Survival Island, should read, Sink me Island: Another hype movive that is so, lets keep it basic, stupid. one scene she takes off all her clothes and comes out with her bottoms on. and there are more of this camera work. it's just a bad movie.
0	Sucked: You know those movies that make you feel sick and disgusted, and wish you didn't see the movie to begin with. Well, this is one of those movies. Man, those writers in Hollywood have no class or morals. I don't know what they paid Kelly Brook to do the movie, but I'm sure she realizes now it wasn't worth it.
1	5 Stars for Kelly Brook!: If you like Kelly Brook the British bombshell you should see this movie! Kelly is hot running around the island in a white bikini. There are also some nude scenes and Kelly shows off her perfect legs, ample mellons and her perfect shape. After she washes ashore on the island we see her laying on her tummy in the sand until she regains her strength. The camera hovers on her butt for a bit. Thank you! She has the perfect bottom. Also lots of skinny dip scenes with Kelly topless and less. She gets attacked by the sailor and this scene goes completely nude. There is a surprise twist to this scene.Kelly Brook fans will enjoy this movie!
0	Really?: So, who wrote this, because it had to be a man. Of course, women could never survive without a man, could they? And wouldn't they just do the silliest possible things imaginable? Treat each other terribly? Or run around with flowers in their hair and dance all day? Not one of them would be able to grow their own food, and for sure - they would absolutely drug and abuse any other women out of what? jealousy? Oh please. The only good part of this is the end where the only man alive after the rain is GAY!This is just awful, not campy. It belittles women in every possible way. Save your money.
0	useless product: when i first received the product, it worked ok. my grandaughter who is almost 5 and wiegh 40 pounds, bent both rods an now it is broke and usless
1	Satisfied: Other than one of the two screws needed to install this product was missing, I have no issues. The problem was in packaging, as a small crinkled piece of tape was used to stick the loose screws to the back of the plastic crusher. Then the shipping box had cracks in it, so the screw apparently came loose and fell out during shipping. Missing hardware seems to be the norm these days no matter where you purchase products. So far the crusher works great. Time will tell as it is made of plastic, but seems to be sturdy.
1	small but mighty: great product if you only use12 oz cans; had a party, bought16oz cans and had to smash them all by hand, they won't fit unless you bend them a bit at the top by yourself and then you have to hold them in place and try to smash, not very productive. otherwise, great
1	Best Can Crusher: I can't believe I have been crushing and recycling cans for 30 years and have been wasting my time with other crushers. I just installed the Easy Pull crusher and got to work crushing the cans that have backed up since my old crusher died and all I can say is Wow! Easy Pull is hands down the best can crusher I have ever used, none of the others even come close! I know this unit costs three times what my old one did but it is worth every penny. One more nice thing about it: because it is made mostly of plastic (nylon) it is much quieter that other crushers (just an added bonus).
0	Junk!!: This thing is JUNK! After crushing only 4....yes 4 cans it snapped in two. Way over priced for the quality. It's nothing but plastic. I would recommend spending a lot less on a different product...which will probably quarantee at least more than 4 total cans crushed over the life of the product.
0	No caller ID: As the last review says - I too did not realize this model does not have caller ID. Sellers should state this specifically. Very disappointed as well. Wish I had seen the previous complaint before purchasing.
0	Cats had fleas within a month: Both cats were infested with fleas, the worse they have ever had within a month of using these collars, and both my cats are indoor only cats. I was very disappointed.
1	Space Invaders: Space Invaders rocks!!! The cool 3-D graphics are so cool! I have it for Game Boy Advance SP. I got all the way through the game and won!!! It is a great game to play!
1	Just Plain Fun: Sure the graphics aren't stunning but for some unexplicable reason this game is just plain fun, I haven't yet treid out multiplayer but I know that the regular game is really fun!
0	The only book that I actually wish to never even see again.: The first time I tried to read this and failed I assumed that maybe I was distracted and would try again later. The second time I convinced myself that I had too many books on the go at the one time. The third time I told myself that I was too busy to give it the time it deserved. Frankly, I have now learnt that if you need to try for the fourth time to read something and have to force yourself to keep turning the page it is a bad sign.This is frankly the only book that I have purchased that I not only don't want anymore - but I don't want to inflict it on anyone else by giving it to charity. The story was woeful. The characters are impossible to like or in any way relate to. This is my quiet warning. If you are simply looking for a good read you are wasting your time here.
1	Tender: One of the most tender and true to the heart works by E.M. Forster, teenagers as well as adults will find this classic one that will keep them up all night. The gentle love of young middle classed Emerson for the wealthy Lucy his only heightened when his uncontrollable love for her fluctuates. He doesn't know how to tell her!!! And when he does try to tell her, he only shocks and suspends her. Fantastic!
0	Blurry, Faded, and Flat: This print arrived today; as soon as I unrolled it I realized I had made a mistake with this purchase. The quality is worse than if I had printed it on "fast draft" on my inkjet printer. The colors are incredibly under saturated, the contrast is extremely low, and the details are blurry.The original work is dark, and bright, with every shade of red and gold and grey. This is predominantly beige and brownish-orange. I never expected them to be able to replicate the actual metallic paint in the "5" in the center, but the colors of this whole print are way off.Furthermore, the entire painting is not on this print- about an inch all the way around is missing- in the original painting, on the right hand side, the window says "...ART CO." however this print has the "CO." cut off.This print is going in the trash.
0	I would rather scrape: I dont care for this item. I would rather scrape the windshield off. The elastic is to short to hook onto anything. I bought two and they are going in with our rummage sale items, to be sold or given away.
1	GREAT PRODUCT.: the shield is easy to install and works great. I used to scrape frost off my girls cars for10 minutesand now 2 seconds to remove the screen.
1	There is no better Physics text for the non-Ph.D. reader.: This excellent series of texts covers almost every topic in modern physics. This is the only book on Physics that covers all this complex physics topics that could be understood by anyone with a college degree. However, for those without background in Calculus, you may have some trouble.
0	The lame observations of an unfunny man.: I'll keep this short since I've already wasted enough time reading this garbage. Chuck Klosterman presents his limited view on a number of uninteresting topics. He presents his humorless observations as if they have some bearing in absolute truth, when they are just solely his poorly thought out perceptions. The only reason one would purchase a book such as this is to get a laugh. However, there isn't a single funny line in this entire book.
0	Can you say boring three times fast?: Oh, how I wanted to love this book. I love books about nothing, especially when people write about nothing very well. Nothing can be really amusing, and nothing is the perfect prelude to sleep. This book, however, almost induced a coma with all of its pretentious stupidity and references to Pamela Anderson and various serial killers. While the effort to be Deep and Outrageously Funny shown through like a 5000 watt lightbulb, the actual result amounted to one of the most mind-numbing and tedious expositions on Nothing that I have read in a long time. (Read at your own risk.)
1	clever: I liked this book. I can't say I loved it (hence, the 4 stars), but I really liked it. Crafty, clever, and every bit of life should have a soundtrack.He knows his pop culture and he has a way of reminding you of what you thought you knew but had 'mis'-forgotten. Clever material ranging from Zach Morris to Pam Anderson to Billy Joel. A quick read and the kind of read that actually provides interesting resources for how to look at what only appears to be the benign things that constitute this culture. Good stuff.
0	you're better off reading cocoa puff box.: This book is a complete waste of time. I can't imagine how anyone could get an ounce of entertainment or enlightenment from this book.The one part that sticks out is the short essay on probabilities. The author says that there's only one probability in life: 50/50, everything is either going to happen or not. So the odds of winning the lottery: 50/50. I assume that if you are capable of reading this review that you understand this is blatantly false.Maybe I should start writing books. Here's my first essay: we don't need weathermen. The weather tomorrow is either going to be hotter or colder than it was today. Three days from now it will either rain or not. I'm sure if I stretched that theory out, added some flowery language, and gave it a catchy title the new yorker would tell all their readers that they need to like my book.
0	Limited Coverage: I agree with the other comments about the coverage only being for large metro areas or POI such as Grand Canyon or Wine Country. For intermittent information between large cities it nothing.Really not worth $50. get an AAA book
0	Rip-off!: Garmin and Fodors should be ashamed of this product. The coverage is absurd. In Washington D.C. I looked for a restaurant near my current location. Nada, but I was surrounded by a wide variety of places to eat, some of them very highly rated by local media. This guide wanted me to go most of the way across town, an expensive cab ride, to a neighborhood that I was advised wasn't very safe. You're better off to Google the city before you visit and take along a few pages of printouts. Do not waste your money on this piece of garbage.
0	Hampered by use of custom libraries: Being an O'Reilly fan it is hard for me to find fault with their no-nonsense approach to technical books, but there is one MAJOR issue I have with this book.As a developer for a major corporation I cannot use custom libraries for my work, especially when the license (http://www.servlets.com/cos/license.html) does not allow for commercial use. Where it would be helpful to see details on creating say, a multipart request class, Bruce Perry instead uses the com.oreilly.servlet.MultipartRequest class to hide much of the functionality (this is just one example).This makes little or no sense. Developers in the real world need real examples. Hiding the implementation of such under the non-commercial license pretty much ruins much of the potential application of an otherwise well written book. If you buy this book realise that only some of it will actually be useful in the real world.
1	'The Engager' - works good: Our company had some trailers that had dead batteries in the 'break-away' systems. Instead of just replacing batteries - (which were quite expensive) I decided to replace the whole system. Found the 'Hopkins Engager' at Amazon. It was cheaper than a battery for our existing systems and came with a switch and everything else new. It was easy to install and it works good. I really like the battery meter that tells if your charge circuit is working on the pull vehicle. Good product
1	Prior Reviews Are Not of This Set: I have not heard all of this set yet. I have the box Verve box set too and it is really great. The Verve Songbook Box has lots of the same material as included in this box set.The point of my writing this review is that all the prior reviews of this set are really from earlier issues of Ella's music. None of the reviews are of this set. All of the other reviews are dated before this set actually was released.More later.
0	Terrible quality control.: The Charge TTi that I received was stuck on one side so the bottle opener and screwdriver would not open or lock correctly. I understand that titanium can be difficult to work with, but something like this should have never made it past quality control. A defect like this is totally unacceptable, especially on a Leatherman that costs over $100. I am very disappointed and will be returning this tool immediately.
1	Perfect Tool!: This product is really nice. I love how light weight it is, yet so incredibly durable. Leatherman is a great company and I have to say, to this day, I have not had a bad product. One thing I Like better than my surge is the scissors both have scissors but i like that the Charge is spring assisted just smoother cutting. Perfect tool.
0	Crane not real. Cheap toy. Falls apart easily.: I was looking for an inexpensive construction toy for my 3 year old son. This looked like a fun play set but it is a little lame. The crane falls apart when you spin it because it does not clear the back of the set. I thought the crane would move up and down but it has plastic 'ropes' that are fixed and do not move. The ramps detach when you move it. The wrecking ball knocks down the blue shed easily but too easily for my taste. Makes for a high mom/dad maintenance requirement to reset it over and over. The die cast trucks are what you would expect for the price. I expected the toy to be a little on the flimsy side since it was inexpensive I just wish the crane really worked and it held together better.
1	Founding "god" father: This streamlined synopsis of the teachings of Jesus Christ is drawn from the gospels of the bible without any religious dogma. The parables Jesus spoke are compiled nicely and provided me with the life lessons which I attempt to live by.
1	Piece of American History: This bargain is an impoprtant piece of American history. Jefferson was a diest, which they viewed God as like a fine clock maker and made the government intself, not the constitution. They got rid of anything supernatural from the Bible. It stands along side the King James Bible and the1611 edition of the King James, the works of Martin Luther as one of the most important reads for a Christian in American history. I liked it a lot, but it's too skimpy a volume to be a classic, but it is famous.
1	Wolf Woman is the best book I have ever read: Wolf Woman is an exciting story I read. It was about a girl called Wolf-Woman by the clan.Tanith is meant to be part of a family but is treated like an outsider. Then this man, Gibran, has come to say he loves Tanith.``We chose each other, the wolves and I,though our first meeting is so far back in my life that it is lost in the shades of memory.''This is the most exciting part!I think all teenagers should read this book if they like a good book about not fitting with people in with but fitting in well with animals.
0	Borrrrrring: I heard about the game on TV & thought it looked like sooooo much fun, was I wrong, oh yes!!! Theres only a few things todo, make mixes (that turn out really bad), dance(or press falling buttons as they fall) and pick out clothe(the best part of the game!) I mean the graphics r good & I still like Mary-Kate & Ashley, but there's no point to the game really!
1	erinsmom: Love this diaper bag-the only negative thing about it is that I tend to "over fill" my diaper bag, and when you do this, it makes it difficult for the magnet closure to work. But overall, it is great!
1	Not Much Room: I like the bag. It's stylish, gender friendly, and easy on my shoulder! I really like that when I take my son to daycare, he's the only one with this bag! My only complaint is that there is not much room when traveling. When on the road for an hour and a half, two hours, I need to pack extra things and just not too much room for those things. So, I end up taking my old bag.
1	Hillman is authoritative, erudite and comprehensive.: James Hillman's book Kinds of Power, srikes a chord of resonance at every root "chakra" in the human body. Two dozen associates under the rubric of "power" are brought to bear upon the reader. Hillman appears to "make up" his analysis as he goes along, but, with his intellect and breadth of pedantic knowledge, he stays a steady course from start to finish. Hillman is convincing, forever analytical and sufficiently critical. He does have a way of getting off the path at times and entertains his way through some tough issues by employing a bit of sophism. Nonetheless, overall, a book well worth reading.
1	Way to go, Jackie!: This is one game that was a long time in the making, and like his movies, it is full of action. What I like about it is it doesn't try to confuse you with all of the motions you can do by pressing10 million buttons. The plot of the game (Jackie loses package to gang) actually sounds like a plot for one of his movies. Also JC providing his moves and his voice to the game is a real plus. He is one of the most respected moviemakers, and this game shows it. For one thing, it is not excessively violent. Anyone can play. JC sets a good example to kids with that and he is definately a role model in my book. Way to go, Jackie!
0	disappointed: this item did nothing to educate nor inform the audience of the artist Vincent VanGogh as a person nor his work
1	a bomb ... streetball title for your ps2: When I first purchased this game, I was a little skeptical about its play value. I had heard very mixed reviews and I just wanted to see what the games was like for myself. It turns out I made the right choice. This game has a solid street "feel" to it and all the secrets are a nice touch. I mean hey, who wouldn't want to see celebrities and real life ballers shakin' each other up and putting shame on each other. But, every game has its drawbacks. The create-a-baller system and the camera angles are just awful. This definitely needs to be worked on to keep its gamers hooked. The music was good, but gets very repetitive, its much better to just put the music on mute and just play your faorite pump up music. But, still a good game nonetheless.
1	STREET HOOPS: STREET HOOPS IS THE BEST BASKETBALL/AND1 GAME I HAVE EVER PLAYED.IT IS SO TIGHT BECAUSE YOU CAN PLAY GAME MODES LIKE ;KING OF THE COURT,LORD OF COURT,HALF-COURT PICK-UP,AN LAST FULL-COURT PICK-UP.WHEN YOU EARN ALOT OF MONEY YOU CAN GO TO THE STORES SUCH AS;FOOTACTION,THE BARBER SHOP,THE TATOO SHOP,AND THE BET PLACE.THERE ARE OHTER REASONS I LIKE THIS GAME,BUT I HAVE TO GO .SO MAKE SURE YOU GET THIS GAME.
1	This book speaks to the heart of life: I can truly say this book made me come to grips with the focus of my life. I have so struggled to make sense of my time on earth and have I made a difference. Such an important quest comes full circle after reading what happens when all hope is removed. I have given a copy of this book to both my sons. I want them to be fulfilled men.
1	Hope in Suffering: Viktor Emil Frankl, eminent psychiatrist and founder of logotherapy passed away on September1997.A sadness swept through me as I heard of his death. "Man's Search for Meaning" was the very first book of his that I read, and along with many others who have read this best-seller I have been comforted with his simple but sagely advise: "[E]ven the helpless victim of a hopeless situation, facing a fate he cannot change, may rise above himself, may grow beyond himself, and by so doing change himself. He may turn a personal tragedy into a triumph."Dr. Frankl shall be remembered as one who gave humanity the courage to go through life's tumult and to endure suffering with dignity.
1	Search for Meaning: At times this book can be a little dry, but when you look at the book as a whole its a amazing book.The book in part one covers Frankl's experiences in a concentration camp. This part forms the base of the ideas of logothearpy. It's a great story and very interesting to see how person takes to such a horrible event.Second part of the book is on his theory of logothearpy. Very interesting idealogy. Covers some cases in it. The basic idea being that each person creates his own reality and meaning, whatever meaning a person finds in his/her life is the right one.third part is a update taken from a lecture he gave. Goes over some of the same material in part II and expands on it.Great book, worth the day or two it takes to read.
1	Interesting: This book is more than a simple retelling of what happened in the concentration camps. It examines our behavior in times of extreme stress.
1	A path from apathy...: From the perspective of a member in a culture consumed in the "existential vacuum", Frankl's experiences and logotheraphy discussion offers a call to action for those prepared to live a meaningful life. This book will change you.
1	Get a hard copy: If you are intrigued by human nature this is a book for you. If you need a change in perspective this is a book for you. If you feel like a victim, this is the book for you. If you are in recovery for PTSD, Substance abuse, or just plain flat in life, this is a book for you.
1	Very meaningful read: This was a very compelling book to read. I couldnt keep it down till I finished the whole book. The reader will definitely be able to relate himself or herself to the real life examples mentioned in this book. This book gives one the revelation that the difficulties or challenges one faces in life are definitely far more better than the concentration camp experiences of the author and it gives one the confidence to face and overcome any situation successfully in life provided one has found the true meaning of his life. A must read book for all!
1	Inspiring: I read it for inspiration as much as for wisdom. It is hard to image the horrors he must have faced in the concentration camps and the loss of his family. The fact he could come out of it with such vision and ability to inspire and help others is amazing.
1	A book that can help you lifelong: This is the first book I read that can offer ordinary people with extraordinary power to overcome unimaginable difficulties. If one is equipped with such power, he becomes invincible. Such power is not money, ranks, social status, and etc. Instead, it is "man's deepest desire to search for meaning and purpose". That desire will not only shape how one will lead his life, but also make all troubles around him less upsetting compared to the meaning of life. Most of all, he is happy no matter what happens.
1	A MUST Read!: This is life-changer upon one's mindset for facing the trials in life. A truly awesome book. I first received this book as a gift and when I saw the title I knew that this was a book that I would never have bought for myself because of the title "Man's Search for Meaning". Because as a Christian I understand the meaning of life. But this book deepened my understanding of adversity and I found it to be of great value. I then ordered two more books; each for 2 men serving life in prison and I hope this turns their despair to joy.
1	A Must Read: This is a book everyone needs to read at least one or more times.Viktor Frankl has given us invaluabletools for living. His experience hasbrought Logotherapy into being.He gives hope a whole new meaning.
1	Best PS2 Motorcycle Game.: This is the best PS2 bike game available. It isn't perfect, the soundtrack is lacking and the graphics are nothing special. I do however enjoy the physics modelling and gameplay. If you brake while leaned over in a curve the bike will tend to stand up/run wide (very much like my own road going sport bike). The arcade modes are probably too hard for most but the career mode (Riding Spirit) is tonnes of fun. Now if they could spruce up the graphics, add some online play, and improve the soundtrack...
1	Sundrinker by Zach Hughes: A great page turner!! Over much too soon!! This one is heartly recommended and most readers will simply devour it!!
1	Money, Murder and a Dachshund! What more could you ask for?!: I really liked this movie! Yes, it is a bit silly, but it is a movie for the whole family to enjoy! Plus, it is set in Monte Carlo with (the late)John Candy and a Dachshund! I also liked the music, and George Hamilton is a spanish gigolo playboy with a great tan. Also, the several sub-plots, especially with Cybil Sheppard, I thought was played very well. Oh, yes, don't forget the murder of the unseen Dachshund owner! Overall I really enjoyed it and have seen it several times.
0	Fails at its basic purpose Try another brand: These type of toys are supposed to slide out of your hands when you grab them. However this one has a very large (about1/2 inch) seam where the two pieces are fitted together. That seam has also shrunk so is not only is much thicker in that area than the rest of the toy but also smaller. You can sort of see the seam in the pictures (look for the smaller part). The result is the toy only slips until it hits the seam and given the resistance the seams causes, even does that poorly. I have had other brands of this toy and never noticed a seam and they work quite well (are very hard to hold), but this one is pretty much worthless. It can easily be picked up and needs to be forced to slide in your hand. I strongly recommend you try one made by another company.Reading the other reviews, several of the 5 star ones seem a little too enthusiastic and I would not believe them to be genuine.
1	Yeah for Little Bear!: Once again Little Bear and his adorable, loveable friends have proven that good wholesome cartoons are out there! My 3 yr old adores these movies. My older children watched when on Nickelodeon...so happy I found them for my newest addition. Would recommend to anyone who is unsure of what their children should be watching.
1	bear flick: very sweet. keeps our three year old entertained for a while. little bear has always been a favorite in our family.
0	Books review.: Paper material is bad, pale print with only black and white including charts and graphics, bad glue is used to stick up the papers, book started do dismantle after very short period.However the learning material within is very useful and mandatory for some courses.
0	Could have been way more fabulous: The trick is simple: Take a smash tv series, handpick a bunch of popular songs and blend them and record them on a CD. Send it to the retailers, promote endlessly on the aforementioned show and wait for the sales to hit the sky. What? That this CD never went to the top of the charts? Hmmm, wonder why.... Maybe because the tunes can be found in previously released albums? Or because the remixes were not remotely as good as expected? Or maybe because the good-for-all-taste compilation didn't quite work? Whatever the reason was, this is anything but a fabulous soundtrack. And it is sad for me to admit it, being a follower of the Fab Five escapades. Kylie, Junior Senior and Fischerpooner sound odd paired to the likes of Jamelia (!) and Ingrid(!!!)A chance to create a sort of groundbreaking work has been missed. Sign of times to come for the soon-to-be-old TV formula?
1	Good show, good soundtrack, however...: Love the show, and this soundtrack looks great. But buyer beware...the version of "All Things Just Keep Getting Better" is NOT the version you hear during the opening credits of the show. The version on this CD is the newer remixed version which has been featured on the video to the song. IMO the original version (during the opening credits) was far superior and far more catchy. This new remixed version sounds like, well, a remixed version. So be aware of this before buying the CD. But that's all the bad things I can say about it. The rest of the album is great.P.S. If anyone knows where one can find the original version of "All Things Just Keep Getting Better" (if it even exists on CD) please let me know. Thanks.
0	From Fab 5 to Drab13: One of the best parts about the show "Queer Eye for the Straight Guy" has to be the music - bouncy, upbeat and extremely danceable. So when the soundtrack finally came out I eagerly snapped it up. What a disappointment! Aside from an edgier version of the main theme ("All Things Just Keep Getting Better") none of the music that was heard on the show was on it. It looked like Capitol Records chose these13 songs without an ounce of thought into it.After listening to it once, I ended up trading it in at one of those "We Pay Cash For Your Used CD's" stores. Hopefully the next "Queer Eye For The Straight Guy" soundtrack will be a little more truthful and have music from the actual show (including the original version of "All Things Just Keep Getting Better") and not from (for the most part) musical performers on the Capitol label who need a career boost.
1	Good for working out: Good work-out mix but I could have done without two of the songs on this CD. Otherwise, I enjoyed it.
1	Except for the theme song no biggie: CD in perfect condition. I was hoping the other songs were as good as the theme song. Would perchase only if really into the background songs used on the show.
0	Not as good as the rest: My main problem with this book is that it takes Saul's POV the entire time, and to be honest, his need to contradict himself all the time just annoys the heck out of me and takes up too much space. I'm surprised Saul has a guardian angel at all actually. Narlh is the best reason to keep reading. And how stupid is Saul to never realize that Matt is the Lord Wizard of Merovence despite being told that at least 5 times in 3 days??? That one fact alone nearly made me stop altogether, till I realized Matt had to show up sooner or later so I kept on.
1	oh yeah: this is one of those albums with atmosphere. listen to the whole thing through, you can hear oscar peterson's fingers fingers muscling the keys, hear the talking, the glasses, the musicians communicating among themselves. really great jazz piano. this moves, it's alive!
0	okay game: this game [disappoints]i thought this would be a good game but the graphics [disappoint]and the camera views are awful
0	What?: I am very glad I rented this first. I thought it would be good...judging by the good rating. But this game is BY FAR the worst game cube game I've played.
1	Jim Croce Classic Hits: I received this CD as a gift for my birthday as I had heard it at a friend's house. The music is soothing, funny, thought provoking and melodc. Great buy.
0	WHY this single on BILLBOARD HOT100 top10, IF NOT...: Sometime I bought singles or albums depend on billboard hot chart. I bought this sigle when it hit to billboard top10, I even hadn't heard this song once. I listen this song first ime ,just remind me "LAST NIGHT A DJ SAVED MY LIFE" by MARIAH in GLITTER. And J-LO's vocal just like JANET singing "ALL FOR YOU" or MARIAH singing "DON'T STOP(FUNKIN' 4 JAMAICA). l have too many like "JENNY FORM THE BLOCK" music product. IF this single had'nt hit to top10, I can save the $$$.
1	Audubon Guide to African Wildlife: Excellent book with awesome color pictures and good concise narrative on each species and subspecies. It was very easy to identify all the various animals (large and small) and birds when on safari in Tanzania. Highly recommend .
1	If you Love textile art, you'll love this book: I realize few people are aware of this excellent book - and that's a shame! It's in few libraries and available very reasonably priced, hard cover or soft cover. I own hundreds of creative textile books and this is in the top10. It's outstanding. If you find one, buy it - you'll love it.
0	Disappointing: After reading Soulmates Dissipate I couldn't wait for Ms. Morrison's next novel. I thoroughly enjoyed reading about Jada and Wellington. When I saw that they were in Never Again Once More I couldn't wait to begin the book. How could I have known that I would be in for a rude awakening. I was majorly disappointed. The storyline moved too fast and I really wasn't that fond of jada by the end of the book. I don't think Ms. Morrison should have gone as far as 20 years into the future.
1	Very old.: The original build fest game imo, after red alert (which is also an excellent game). Wait for cossacks 2, being released next year.If you must indulge yourself, the online community is still reasonably strong, with many foreign players making up the majority of people there.
0	There are much better games out there: I recieved this game with several others. The graphics might have been good in 2003, but they are laughable in late 2005.In all fairness, I can't speak to many of this games features because I only played for about an hour, but I won't be going back to this game any time soon.
1	An Excellent and Practical Guide To Grammar: I first read and worked with this book on my own about 9 years ago and it really clarified grammar in a practical, "real life" way for me.It has helped me both as a writer and a reader.As a writer I found more options for expressing myself by having more tools to work with and as a reader it helps me decipher endlessly complex sentences that can resemble a linguistic maze.By being able to break down those complex sentences to their basic constituents, one can clearly see which parts of the sentence are functioning as core ideas, and which are functioning as embellishment.This book is very user friendly and is in my opinion an excellent self study guide with an interesting variety of exercises.Highly recommended
1	well done: well written,by by a good mind.All-in-all, it makes me wonder why mankind took a step backwards since the 60's...and....raither the following generations to come will have such brain farts, as those have done who in the last few decades, in the name of LAW and ORDER(that has caused such disorder.Experimenting is how civilizeatoins progess.You can't expect progress when good minds are supressed and restricted.That would of been like telling Ben Franklin"Kites with keys on them are now against the law to take out into a lightning storm,and,could hurt you.So, if you risk hurting yourself, and take kite with keys out in the lightning storm: By law we will hurt you real bad,and those who love you, so you wont risk hurting yourself any more.(yes it is a backwards step) GOD HELP US!But deffinately enjoyable books to read.
0	Kimi is disgusting: She is a little poser!!! Kimi is the most gross and irritating of the babies. Wearing that stupid little diaper, always so happy. She won't be so happy when I kick her between the legs. Also, those stupid little cowboy boots. She really sucks. I'd like to see her get really injurewd and cry. That shown her!!! The movie was good, but she stinks.
1	Brilliant Movie!: This movie is great for the whole family ! I love it ! Its cute , and written very well . My daughter loves the music , she sings all the songs . 5 stars in my book !
1	LOVE: SMARTEST IDEA EVER AMAZON!!! I HAVE BEEN HONESTLY WAITING FOR THIS MOMENT TO HAPPEN EXCEPT YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO BUY FULL SEASONS. I WANT A FULL SEASON OF RUGRATS!:)
1	Great Family Movie: I took my daughter to see this when it was in the movie theater and she loved it so much that I purchased it for her when it came out on VHS/DVD! This is a great movie for young & old! Great family fun & entertainment! Fans of the Rugrats will be cheering for more!If you want to purchase a movie for a child that is a fan of the Rugrats then this is your movie!
1	Wow...: This statue is an amazing piece. The level of detail and craftsmanship is top notch. I'm glad I was able to pick up this piece while it was still available. I'm kicking myself for missing out on the Skeletor statue that was available a couple years ago.
1	Mind and Finger Stimulation: You not only learn how to type more words per minute, efficiently, it is fun while you are learning. It is positively addicting!
1	A Great First CD: Elliott Yamin's new CD is a great new summer release.His easy going, melodic melodies prove why he ended up on American Idol.This CD is perfect for long car rides with the top down this summer. Yamin's soulful and inspired sounds make life easier and less stressful.His selection of songs highlight his talent and his range as a artist. I particulary liked track 9. This song makes a great dancing tune and the whole CD just sparkles.I'm looking forward to his next so I can add it to my collections
1	Just wonderful!!!: It is so nice to listen to a cd without the usual AI overproducing touches. This is music to not only enjoy listen to but music that you feel!! The songs are so real and heartfelt and I am just enjoying this cd so much. I haven't felt this way about a cd in a long time. There is something for everybody. ballads, r&b;, and even some dance mixes.This album will become a classic for me.....
1	One Word: Amazing...: I woke up at 7AM to go get this CD and it was worth being tired all day at work. Elliott's voice can bring a grown man to tears. There is not one bad song on this CD. I still wonder how Mr. Yamin did not win American Idol 5. He is the most talented person to come out of the competition. I highly recommend that you get this CD and buy copies for all of your friends. Look out world, here comes Elliott!*Songs that are on repeat:-Wait For You-One Word-You Are The One-I'm The Man-Trainwreck-A Song For You (Donny Hathaway would be proud)
1	way to go Elliot!: Great cd. I listen to it all the time! Can't wait for his next one. I'm proud of you Elliot!
1	Elliott's AMAZING: I love it. I have never bought an American Idol record before... I've heard the songs they HAD to put out and hated them. I thought Elliott was so good on American Idol that I thought, like many others, that he should have remained on the show (like Daughtry also should have) but, nonetheless, he was dropped. Much to my shock, while walking through a department store I recently heard a song I loved.. it was "Wait for You" by Elliott. I was floored. He sounds SOOOO wonderful. Now I'm one of his biggest fans. Trust me, his voice just doesn't disappoint. And he's so down-to-earth in interviews and when he sings on shows (like Good Morning America, etc) that you can't do anything but just adore him. It's a great album and I look forward to his future released with great anticipation.
0	Late: This book took forever to get. I didn't recieve it for a month! Emailed and recieved no responce.
0	A good approach but filled with errors.: There are too many errors in this edition to recommend it to a beginner. Approximately 75 errors were encountered. For a second edition, it is surprising that these errors were not corrected. Otherwise, I think this book would have been a good introduction to the Russian language.
1	Fantastic: My husband says this cd rates in his all time favorite top 5, which is saying alot because he has over 800 cds in his collection.
1	Where to find on DVD: Story of a young girl who grows up and falls in love with a Mafia hitman who she doesn't know is the one who had accidently murdered her father during a botched hit. She marries him after becoming pregnant only to shoot him at the wedding when a jealous son of the mafia boss tells her that her new husband had murdered her father. If you loved this miniseries as much as I did and want it on DVD, look for it under the titles Bride of Violence1 & Bride of Violence 2. It has only been released full length on DVD in the Netherlands under the alternate title. Keep in mind that this is a region 2 DVD (PAL) and will only play on a region 2 dvd player or a multi-region dvd player. I got one here on amazon for less than $40.
0	This is the one: to get if you don't really want to hear what Bird was all about but want to have something in your collection by him. That's what this record was designed to do, reach the larger white audience with no real interest in Jazz. 2 stars for Bird managing to make something at least palatable out of Hefti's obnoxious arrangements.
0	Couldn't Deal With The Strings...: If you want to hear the real Charlie Parker, don't buy this Cd because the strings are too overwhelming, believe me. I bought it and took it back the same day. And got another one of his cd's instead. Only1 star for this CD but it's not because of Charlie. I don't even think that Charlie Parker would've sincerely enjoyed this.
0	yeah ... right!: Why are there two prats giving this 5 out of 5. They are so obviously joke reviews. This is an awful movie and the zombie scenes are shut with a low shutter speed, so they end up looking like jerky pop-videos.-Mike
0	BORING REVEANGE GHOST MOVIE!: i saw this movie on SCI-FI last night! this movie is supposedly a "zombie" flick! after watching the part were they come in i was like "wait .. wait oh wait they aren't zombies their ghosts!"even killing scenes were AWFUL i swear this movie looks like if it were a MADE FOR TV movie or something! the "killing" scenes are quite laughable considering ALL the horror movies i have seen! but this movie is more of a family drama about a son who finally gets to meet his dad after so long and they both save each other!this whole movie should have just been an1 hour instead of 2!you could sum up the whole flim in1 hour cause is all their doing is driving in the dessert and encountering revenageful ghosts and only 3 of them surive!skip this movie and go for "return of the living dead"!
0	Surprisingly BORING.: I'm a huge fan of all three of the guitarists featured here, but this documentary is just plain boring. It's kinda cool to see each musician play at first, but the longer the movie goes on, the more you realize there is no over-arching POINT to any of it. It's basically just one giant mash-up. It could have been a great movie if it just had something -- ANYTHING -- to say. Instead it just piddles away a couple of hours without making any kind of real impression.
1	if you enjoy music...get this: very well produced...great musiciansif you enjoy the guitar or rock at all, you will like this
1	Fantastic!!: Such a great experience watching three generations of Rock guitarists come together to share their stories an experiences.I hope other musicians and fans get an opportunity to view this. It's quite a testament to music and how it has a profound effect on musicians and music lovers alike!
1	Best guitar movie ever!: I went in special search of this film on blu-ray, you need it in this format in order to get the film without the audio compression, that DVD has. also, if you get this film turn it WAY UP! Jack White steals the show in this film, but Jimmy Page, and the Edge give a solid rock 'n roll history lesson for the ages! this film is one that if you have nothing to do on a Saturday afternoon pull it out and turn it up!
1	Innovative Gem: A factual docudrama-like film. The visuals in this one are so cool, they'll stick in your mind for a long while. Lena Stolze is the young protagonist, who discovers many hidden secrets of her small German town and how their claims regarding their actions during WWII were as manufactured as her own facade
1	I'm stunned there is no US DVD...great film: Can it be that the only DVD edition of this is for non-US countries? I think this film is brilliant. From start to finish, it showed the impact that one person can have with determination. It is a film in my library I watch at least once a year. What a crime to not have a DVD edition!
0	DO NOT BUY this published version: I'm suggesting not buying this text, not because the content is poor, but rather the publisher has defaced its worth. They equations and examples have somehow become gibberish with random symbols, there is no way to read this text and comprehend it. Percy Bridgman however did do a great job presenting dimensional analysis and because the text is no longer copyrighted you can find it on Google books for free.[…]
1	Retro gaming at its best.: This is a wonderful collection of games from the creative heyday of the video game industry. These are bit-perfect ports of the original games; the Playstation is emulating the1980-era hardware and the original game code is running on the emulator. All the original gameplay is there, including the bugs! Because some of the games, Tempest and Asteroid in particular, had touchy hardware, owning these games on CD is better than owning the coin-ops for most folks. If you grew up with these games, you will enjoy the blast of nostalgia you'll get from playing them again. Today's games have better graphics, but they are not better games!In this collection: Asteroids, Battlezone, Centipede, Missile Command, Super Breakout, Tempest.Also included are short video interviews with the creators of Tempest, Battlezone and Centipede.
1	VHS very good new , very nice seller , I recommend !!! Thank you: Cette VHS est un pre bonheur , quelle joie de retrouver GUY WILLIAMS et tous les autres excellents Acteurs pour1 H 30 d'aventures . Merci Monsieur Disney !!!
0	Not as good: I rented this game and I am glad that I didn't buy it right away. The game is too complicated and there were tons of glitches and i hated it. Bottom line, dont buy it!
1	The weakest of Jordan's series.: I believe this book had only one purpose -- to be a seg-way into the next. But where is the next? This novel lacks the exciting conclusion that I've come to expect. It ended so "wide open" that a reader can't help being frustrated. I hope that Mr. Jordan is alive and well, and will soon give us the novel that is two years coming. His novels have been a source of great enjoyment for me and I miss having a new one to read.
0	That's it...: After spending a lot of time with this series, I have finally given up on The Wheel of Time.Robert Jordan frustrates me. You spend more time reading about what the characters are thinking rather than actually getting any of the plot resolves. Furthermore, the story goes into POVs that really, REALLY don't need to be done.One would think that if you are this far in the series, you should have a broad knowledge of what's going on. But RJ does not think so. He goes on once again to describe every single city and enviroment again and again and again. I mean, how many times can you describe Tel'aran'rhiod?Sadly, I've given up and will no more force myself to finish these books. If you're looking for something fast-paced, something that will work your mind and not bore you with long descriptions about how some random hawk is flying around, then do not go any further.
0	Crown of Bores: I really enjoyed the first three books of the Wheel of Time. In fact I thought they were excellent. Book 5 was horrible, but Lord of Chaos (book 6) was another fine installment. Then we come to book 7. Truly pathetic. Looking for the tight writing and engaging style of the previous books? Looking for some real plot development and character growth? Then don't look at this book. Nothing happens. That's right, in a 700+ page book, nothing happens! The story doesn't move forward. It is filler material, nothing more. Robert Jordan should have been embarrassed to have ever seen this monstrosity go to print. I can only hope that future installments recapture the quality of past ones.
1	Another great adition to the Wheel of time series...: Some people will say this book is slow. Well it is only true for the slow minded. This book is an addition to the series in a more "fill-in-the-blanks" way. It is very good that he did it because sometimes you look back on a story and it just doesn't make any sense. -A very smart adition to the series.
0	To rest on one's laurals...: To rest on one's laurals is to write the later installments of the wheel of time series. I feel like I have been taken for a buggy ride... at my own expense. Stick to the earlier parts because they are something else.
1	I can go on with this forever: Robert Jordan is maybe one of the best authors I have ever read. From the first book to the seventh and soon eighth everyone was a wonder in itself. These books are filled with evergoing suspence,new and original theories,great fun and jokes and multicultural blend full of schemes,color,personalities... And I can go on for another hour, but then again,I probably don't have enough space for the full deal. I don't know what I'd do without RJ and I hope-I pray-that WOT won't ever come to an end.
1	Very enjoyable: Like the rest of the series. This book was gripping from the beginning to the end. Robert Jordon's Wheel of Time Seriers is the best I have read. It is more compelling than David Eddings "The Belgariad", and TOLKEN. p PLEASE keep up the writing and release the books a little quicker is possible
0	the beginning of the end: Indeed, this is the beginning of the end. Well, actually, no, the end began about two books ago in the series. The hope was, it would pick up again...it did not.Hey, in some ways this is the best one since the first two...because it's the shortest. But that's about the only good thing about it.
1	GGGGGRRRRREEEEEAAAAAATTTT: Finally a series of books that takes the time and does it properly. My feeling when I finished reading the Lord of the Rings was that it all finished too soon. Leaps are made, things just fall into place, characters suddenly learn what it is they're meant to do. Not so with these books. The characters are slowly coming into their own. Slowly learning their abilities and shaping their course. Brilliant. If the story is slow then it's as it should be, frustrating. It just makes it more worth while at the end of the day.
0	ARRGGHHHHHHHHHHHHH: At least I see that there are other readers as frustrated as I am. What started out as an epic, has become drawn out and almost painful to read. The last two books, which I bought in hard back so eager was I to continue the story, have left me feeling used. Is there an amount of books the publishers need Mr. Jordan to write? Mr. Jordan - go back to the first few books, reread them - enjoy them as much as I did and start writing properly again - let the story go on its own - stop holding it back. The series is losing fans - please restore my faith and bring me back.
1	Jordan is Awesome: This is by far the most gripping series of books I have ever read. I hope this series goes on FOREVER ! Kill off the Forsaken slowly....and bring back Moiraine-We miss her. I buy the hardback edition of each book and do not sleep until I have finished the book !! I have read these books over and over again....I love them
1	Should I or shouldn't I buy #7?: I went through much of the reviews for book #7 and it's pretty split between the pros and cons.I'm almost done with #6, and cannot decide if #7 would be worth reading. Maybe skipping it and jumping to #8? Any opinions? As a whole, I give the series (#1 - #6) an 8. That's it
1	The best fantasy series since Tolkien: I waited a long time for this book, and when I finally got my hands on it, it proved to be worth waiting for. I can understand those who think that nothing happens, but personally I don't care. The world and characters of Jordan becomes more and more alive for each book he writes. CoS isn't best of the books i the series but I still think it's great
1	music with soul: i am sick and tired of reading all these reviews that diss g. love and his sound. music critics desparately try and pigeon-hole him into a category with little sucess. i have heard him compared to acts as varied as beck and soul coughing. why don't people understand that this cd is just fun music that you can move to? i'm not trying to act like i know g. and what he is trying to do with his music, but i know i have a good time listening to this cd. so if you want to listen to something different from all the metal/rap combination groups and hear a fresh sound, buy this cd and get down.
0	Nice but short life: The device is nice, it allows to use your ps1 or ps2 controller (which I actually prefer) in the gamecube.The problem is it broke just 3 months after I bought it, so this isn't worth it, buy an original gamecube controller, or another adapter.
1	So many twists and turns: This is a fun film. You never know what will happen next or who the good guys are. Unlike most standard Hollywood films where you know who's the good guy, who's the bad guy and who's the damsel in distress, this film is full of clever shifts and turns and some very good acting.
0	Poorly Written: I admit that my programming experience is rather limited, but this book made me feel like a complete .... There is no denying that the author knows what he is writing about, but he does not convey that information in an easily understood manner. Unless you already know everything there is to know about RMI, networking and advanced Java programming, stay away from this book.
1	City of God: I received my order on time and in perfect condition. I would definately buy from this seller again.
0	Mold: Bought this book for class and the text was covered in mold. Working on trying to remove the mold now.
1	Pilot's Perspective: I like adventure books, especially those that deal with northern flying. This title clearly fell into that catagory. The autor gave us a perspective of the Iditarod race that only a pilot could. As a pilot who has flown in Alaska I found all of his flying information to be accurate. But best of all the book was very well written. The author has polished his work. The chapters are all very readable and fascinating. I would recommend this book to anyone whose interests run along the same lines as mine do; flying, Alaska, adventure and the Iditarod. My only complaint is a complete lack of pictures.
0	Presentation of concepts needs improvement: This booked is packed with information however the presentation needs vast improvement.Specifically the inclusion of a concept map at the beginning that gives a graphic view of hte concepts to be presented. Then concepts maps of each chapter's topics is necessary then. And if possible more concept maps for topics with in each chapter. These concepts would be more understandable with concept maps as graphic organizers of the information presented.
1	More blues and less rock on this one: Marcia is a fine singer who writes many of her own songs, though she is never afraid to record covers where they are suitable. Her albums can be almost relentlessly upbeat, as with Hot tamale baby, but this is generally a much sadder album - more like one would expect from a blues singer.Marcia still demonstrates her Jerry Lee-ish piano playing here, on the opening Red beans, the third track Down the road and particularly on her cover of Joe Ely's Fingernails, but those are not typical of this particular album.More typical is the title track, in which Marcia painted her house blue after her man left for good, or St Gabriel, about being sent to prison and later being released with nowhere to go.This is a fine album that demonstrates Marcia's ability to sing a variety of different types of song.
1	God bless you Jake: This book was our Brass Tech. textbook in college. It was great reading it and understanding so much. What helped was our professor had studied with Mr. Jacobs and had a little more insight. This book is very informative, but doesn't read like a text book. Highly recommend to any wind player or music educator.
1	Great game: Picture quality=5sound=3gameplay=4over all the only mess up is that the controls were to loose
1	soon to be the greatest guitar player ever.....great music!!: not as technical as his last cd but the music reflects exactly what the title is "undiscovered soul" Great job Richie, this cd is in my car all the time. Give us some more !!!!
1	Superb camera -- Buy it now!: I've used this camera now for 6 months and own 3, 5D bodies! I've used it with the following Canon lenses:24-70mm f/2.870-200mm f/2.885mm f/1.2200mm f/1.8300mm f/2.8I've shot EXTENSIVELY with all lenses WIDE OPEN and have not seen ANY vignettely indicated by a couple of other reviews. Are you kidding me? This thing is super sharp from center to edge.The full-frame censor comes in mighty handy when you need to crop and don't think this is an insignificant thing. If you can perfectly frame all your shots then maybe you don't need this capability.I would highly recommend this camera as the absolute be value out there in a DSLR regardless of brand.
1	Cute: These shoes are better than I expected. They are adorable and decent enough quality, considering the price. They are a little tight in the toe and I have narrow feet, or so I thought. I went up a size since I fall on a half size normally. I would HIGHLY recommend that others do the same to make the toe more comfortable. Otherwise, they are easy enough to walk in, very cute, and fairly comfortable.
1	Great Time shoe!: I love to go out and dress up with these shoes on! They are pretty comfortable and fun!
1	Halloween Shoes: Perfect for many costumes and not all that uncomfortable. Very happy with the product and price!
0	Rent before you Buy: What a bad movie. Pitch Black was great but this mess doesn't even come close. The only reason I'm giving it two stars is because I didn't watch the entire movie. I fell asleep half way thru this bomb and didn't want to waste another 3 bucks renting this a 2nd day to finish it.
1	Worth it: Surprisingly, this was my introduction to the Riddick series. Watching this led me to Pitch Black, a truly great film. It's true, the Chronicles storyline is skeletal, but the action keeps the pace moving along so there isn't a great deal of time to wonder "why...?" Its not until after the film that thoughtful reflection reveals how thin the plot is. The ending was a surprise, which is a pleasure in this era of movie-making. The special effects are stunning and believable, an especially impressive feat with Sci-Fi films. Vin Diesel is great. Granted, he doesn't need alot of range for the role, but he makes the most out of it. His marvelous voice conveys as much nuance as character development allows, and his physique is impressive. He really is deft at conveying feeling (or lack thereof) through body language. Actually, the action films I own are for watching while I exercise, and this is one I have watched more than once and will undoubtably watch again. Its a good specimen of its' genre.
0	hm: I would say that the only thing less interesting than the movie itself were the special features included in the disk.Ok, there were definitely some cool action scenes. However, there was little to no character development. The story and subplots seemed to have been ripped off from a bunch of other stories (including the prophecy and the killing of the sons--read mythology much?). The motivations of the characters seemed somewhat random and irrelevant.This dvd was given to me as a gift. I would have never purchased it myself (had I seen the movie). I think this movie is worth watching once, and that's about it. No point to owning it.
1	yes!: this is the best movie I've ever seen. the story is great and the actors couldn't have been chosen any better. I love u vin diesel!
0	Tied with White Chicks for worst Movie of 2004: How many science fiction and fantasy cliches can you put in a movie? Just watch Riddick and start counting. I seriously think this should have been a parody of sci-fi and fantasy because this movie is THAT BAD. Pitch Black was great but for this "sequel" they basically rewrote the Riddick character to fit into this jumbled mess of a movie. The acting was laughable. The story was ridiculous and it stole from movies like Star Wars, Star Trek, LOTR, Escape from New York, forget about it. I don't want to continue listing because I think you should get the point. Don't waste any $$$ or time on tis steaming pile of crap. You might as well call Vin Diesel's career dead or on the same level as Seagal and Van Damme. Straight to cable and DVD.
1	Beautiful butterfly book: I loved the book because of the beautiful color pictures,small size, soft cover, information on the butterflies.It would be more informative if it had the small United States mapshowing each type of butterflies range. I only need info on Minnesota butterflies at this time.
1	Audubon Society Field Guides: Audubon Society Field Guides make great gifts for children and adults. I often give the books as gifts along with bird houses and bug houses. I always make sure that everyone knows that they should never kill any wildlife that is outside in our big world. I love my own collection of these books.
1	Peterson's is better: This one comes in second. It's definitely for the amateur and is very nicely illustrated. My main beef is it requires too much page flipping and the organization is poor. The one I prefer in the field is Peterson's. It's more pocket sized and quicker for reference use.
0	TOO OLD: It was last revised in 2002, that's twelve years ago. Need I say more for such a fluid topic. oNE MORE WORD.
0	slow and repetitious: Having made it to page 88, reading through several repetitions and reminders of character's abilities or facts, I began to wonder whether this would continue. So, I flipped to page 336 and picked up from that point without skipping a beat...or boredom. Needless to say, I did not finish this book--didn't even care who dunit. 2 stars for making it to page 88 and not putting it down sooner.
1	one of my favs: This one of my favorite books of Chris'. I have read them all and can't wait for the next one to come out. He's a great story teller and has a great duo in Jon and David to carry from book to book. Exact.
0	Don't even bother with this one: It it wern't for Russell Crowe, this would have been a complete failure. The plot takes place in a fictional country in Latin America. The main conflict of the movie is that Meg Ryan's husband gets kidnapped by gorillas. Throughout the movie he is abused, denied of a shave or a shower, and is put to rotten work. Russell Crowe is the man in charge of working out a deal with the gorillas to free Ryan's husband. At the same time there is a sexual tension brewing between Meg Ryan and Russell Crowe. In my opinion, it is pretty pathetic that Meg Ryan would show interest in another man while her husband is in captivity by hostile gorillas. The whole movie is really bad, Meg Ryan is a just terrible, the only good part is the action seen at the end, but it doesn't quite save the movie.
0	Nice but: I saw this movie about four times on a transatlantic flight yesterday (well I really watched it only once...) and I found it somewhat entertaining but not really exciting. Maybe that's a good thing. The drama side was refreshingly life-like (too bad it doesn't cater for today's scandal-hungry soap opera audience).On the other hand, the action side was a disappointment. Sure there was thrilling suspense and bullets and fire and blood, but the outcome was not very realistic. It was almost as bad as "The Saint." It was nice entertainment though -- I wish they could rig every war and other sports event the same way.
0	So So Movie: This movie had decent ratings on imdb. I wanted to see an action flick with a mix of thriller. This movie was ok and that exciting. All this have going for it is Russell Crowe.
1	Very Realistc: Although it takes a little while to get rolling, this movie was surprisingly realistic. It was well done, and has a VERY tense scene near the end, which really makes the whole movie worth while.
1	Superman like you've never seen before: You like superman? You like Russians? The. Put them together and you will get a great story of a world that could have been... A must have for any serious comic collecter
0	Shallow vision of Socialism. Mediocre at best: Red Son is awful in his superficiality. What could've been a very beautiful statement about mankind, economy and Super-powers ended basically just as another regular Superman story, just with him using another black suit. There is nothing in Red Son about a communist Superman or about Comunism itself. It's just another mediocre Superman story throwing just bits of uneducated and biased ideas and giving hints of him dating WW (who cares about that?).Worse than that, the format make the issues so large they become tiring to read. The cover art is beautiful, but the rest inside it really sucks.
1	One of the better Disney films of the1980s.: Full of adventure and mystery, in this film, Disney takes a slightly more sophisticated turn and the outcome is really enjoyable. The film has really nice animation especially the scene atop Big Ben. The voice talent is great, especially the dastardly Vincent Price. The villain is good, and very malicious and powerful. The DVD is really good as well. The movie is in a new letterbox treatment- very nice. I highly reccomend this film for anyone who loves the Disney film genre.
0	It stinks: All of the spooky characters of the original Sherlock Holmes, but none of the charm. Dont get this movie for little ones!!!!
1	MANKIND'S GREATEST ACHIEVEMENT: When the aliens land in my backyard, and they come to me and they say "Earthling, tell us what is the greatest single thing you Earth people have ever accomplished so that we may document your planet's contribution to the Universe" that's when I will hand them my copy of 'Apocalypse Now' and humbly say "here"
1	Very good movie: A Very good movie, well dispatched in time. The blu ray box bore few bumps on each sides certainly because of the handling
1	Great movie!!!!: Godfather director and great cast. Besides the known big names in the movie, there are smaller appearances by a young Harrison Ford, Laurence Fishburne, Dennis Hopper and a great cameo by the man that changed Rock n Roll- Bill Graham.
1	this isn't a bubble gum, shoot'em up movie...: this movie requires intelligence to piece together Coppola's masterpiece. this movie is at stanley kubrick quality. even the way the Door's "The End" weaves throughout the movie deserves 5 stars... How could someone say that the ending is weak? It ISN'T VISUAL! It should blow you away mentally... if it doesn't, it went over your head. This movie is very quotable too.
0	Poor DVD quality: I love this movie but the quality of the DVD is very poor. towards the end the DVD stops and starts several times which is very annoying.
0	You really have to be kidding me.....: I'm sorry but I just don't get it.This is a long movieThis is a boring movieI could never understand why people got so into this flick. I find it a great chore to sit through.
0	I wanted to turn this disc into a coaster...: It may be a classic to many people, but only sheer will and determination allowed me to sit through it. It was horrible. It was long, boring, and pointless. The director intended this film to showcase the different facets of war and the madness that it brings to some people. I should've known the madness was intended for his audience.The story is about Captain Willard (Martin Sheen) on a mission to find and execute the highly decorated and brilliant renegade Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando), who has turned mad (undoubtedly because of war).Please don't waste 3 hours of your life watching this movie.LEAP rating (each out of 5):============================L (Language) - 3 (writers get all philosophical and artsy with Brando's lines)E (Erotica) -0 (n/a)A (Action) - 2 (doesn't force you to the edge of your seats, that's for sure)P (Plot) -1 (Sheen is sent into Cambodia to hunt down Brando, plain and simple)
0	BORING, BAD ACTING, NOT REALISTIC, AWFUL: This movie is not worth seeing. Don't waste your time, and go for the newer productions. In the time the movie was made they certainly did not know what they were doing.
0	New BluRay: Great movie but I could not play it on my Oppo blu-ray player....and the Internet chat rooms are full of problems with this version. It simply won't play. Dec 2011
0	Don't let the packaging fool you!: I own all 3 apocalypse now's (original, redux, and this)I must say that I have become more and more disappointed as I went down the line.Original version (1979) on DVD contains everything that was meant to be there, just no impressive multimedia or extras.Redux came along and made some desirable but mostly undesirable tweaks to the original.THE VERSION YOU ARE BUYING is in my mind a total rip off to anyone who owns the redux and or original!!!I advise anyone who doesn't own apocalyse now on dvd to go ahead and buy it, BUT IF YOU DO OWN THEM save your money!!!
0	Two stars for redux five for the original: Let me begin with saying that apocalypse now is one of my all time favorite movies so i was excited when i saw that they had rereleased it and then i saw in and now know why the scenes included in this version were deleted in the first place, because they take away from the continuity of the story line to me they became a destraction and towards the end were just plain annoying. You cannot improve on perfecton as this DVD proves so save some money and just buy the original.
1	Another Coppola Masterpiece: Indeed Apocalypse Now is one of Francis Ford Coppola's masterpieces, along with The Godfather and The Godfather Part 2. Probably one of the movie industry's best war films ever, Coppola's vision of the Vietnam War is unlike any war movie I've ever seen. It truly showed the horrors of the war and the young soldiers who became crazy over the fact they had to be brought into Vietnam without experience. Ranking #28 in AFI's100 movies of all-time, I believe it fits the right place. I now can't wait to see Hearts of Darkness: A Film Maker's Apocalypse. And one more thing: Marlon Brando couldn't have performed his part any better.
1	Haunting Film, Semi-Dissapointing Disc: The first time I saw Apocalypse Now for my 9th grade Vietnam War project I knew I had seen something special, but was left saying "huh?" Upon furthur viewing and reading the book it was based on It's becoming a little less hazy, but it's a film I'll be watching over and over again just to get underneath all those layers of the story. The film is topped with great performances my Martin Sheen and Robert Duvall. The other actors in the film are also great. The cinematography is excellent and the great transfer does not dissapoint. The sound is pretty good, but it could've used a little more bass. Overall the sound and video are great, but it's the lack of extras that dissapointed me. Although you do get the napalming of Kurtz's compound with or without commentary, that's about it for extras. A Francis Ford Coppola commentary for the film might've been nice. Oh well. Overall it's a disc well worth purchasing.
1	The greatest war film in history: It puts "Full Metal Jacket" and "Platoon" in the shade. This is easily the best Vietnam film and the greatest war film ever. It topically transfers the setting of Joseph Conrad's epic novella "Heart of Darkness" from the Congo to Vietnam, although it leaves the story, themes and characters relatively intact. Marlon Brando offers an intimidating and overpowering performance. The impact he exerts in the film is profound, even though his face remains in shadow for the most of the duration of his appearance. A classic of the now outdated genre of Vietnam films.
1	''this is the end..'': astonishing film,great performances,the story of Nam,''the end''was or is like that..Brando was''god''..
1	Good classic: This album made earth wind and fire a pop group. Shining Star, That's the way of the world and reasons are hot. However, the songs are just as good.
1	EWF is still the best.: I listened to this album as a high school student and am happy to have the remastered CD in my possesion. See the Light is still my favorite song, however this entire album is in my opinion EWF's 2nd best (All 'n All being my favorite) There does not exist today this kind of musicianship and talent in a band.
1	Greatest of All Time: This, put very simply, is the greatest recording of all time. The opening riffs of "Shining Star" followed by the explosion of the horns signals the birth of a musical world the likes that have never been duplicated. The seamless edits between songs and the small interludes lets the journey flow without interruption. The incredibly tight music of the band coupled with Maurice White and Phillip Bailey's vocals are unmatched, especially on "That's the Way of the World," the best cut on the CD. "Reasons" still never fails to unite lovers to this day. The best thing to do is just grab a bottle of wine, hit play, and let it go from start to finish. It never fails to satisfy.
1	Mortal Kombat Trilogy the bomb?: MKT is really a great game! It takes all of the best features from MK1-3 and translates them flawlessly onto the Playstation platform. This allows die-hard fans like me to play it without the Sega or SNES. However there are two glitches that kind of bother me. One is the fatalities. Sub-Zero's old rip of the head is cut out, and there is no ice grenade to name a few problems. The second is the difficulty level. No matter if you chose Easy and Novice for the tournament, the computer will tear you up in less than 30 seconds once you get up toward the end of the latter! Even if you are Kintaro, Shao Kahn will destroy you. I still haven't beat it. Other than that for [price], it is definently worth it. :)
1	Mortal Kombat!!!: Personally I think that this is the last of the good Mortal Kombats, I don't really kare too much for the one's with all the weapons plus the kombos were Killer in this one. I just like some of the kharacters from the new. I'm glad someone still has this game around. I only have too complaints it seems to freeze up after a 2 player game is done, therefore you have to reset it and the whole Shang Tsung loading thing, other than that I enjoy it and it brings back teenage memories.
1	if color doesnt matter this is for you: Fits perfect just a taupe color but it was cheaper to get this color than to get black. We needed for an extra vehicle so it worked perfectly.
0	Elevator Bensusan.: Yuk. Not because of Pierre Bensusan's efforts. In fact i respect and understand his attempt to try something a bit different. The problem is, I just dont like this kind of music.This is not solo guitar with some vocals like his other albums, this is fully produced, jazzy-mainstream new agey music. It would work well in an office or elevator setting.NOT the heart felt solo guitar chops and vocal genius that his other recordings capture. If you get the pleasure of listening to any of his other albums, you will think its an entirely different musician. This is so different, i have to say its Pierre Bensusan, "NOT"!I reccomend ANY other album by Bensusan, besides this one. Unless, of course, you enjoy mild, new-agey, jazz instrumental albums...if thats the case then you may like it.
1	This has been my absolute favorite movie since i saw it: This is movie fosuses on an11 year old girl's life.she has no mother, and her father works in a funeral home.having only a dad and living in a funeral parlor is only part of Vada's problems. she is absolutely sure she is going die and her only friend is Thomas J. Vada's life begins to turn around after her dad meets Brenda, who, little by little, helps Vada cope with life and death.
1	My favourite move EVER!: This movie is good too the end! It shows the uncertainties of being a young girl, and the troubles of having growing up and having a father remarry, etc. Anna Chlumsky does an excellent job in this movie, and Macaulay Culkin plays a very convincing best friend. This movie will make you laugh and make you cry!
1	She is Strange, but She Has Great Talent.: This is very....interesting CD. She sings about common things but she doesn't make them sound common. She makes them alternative and what a real alternative CD should be about. Her song "I Try" is great along with "Sexomatic Venus Freak," "I Can't Wait to Meetchu," and "Why Didn't You Call Me." These songs will turn out to be great hits and some already have. This is a great value for such a great CD.
0	Let Down: I heard a lot of people talking up this album on the Grammy's so I bought after hearing only the too much played cut" I try". I have to agree with one of the other reviewers about dragging some black girl off the shreets to prop up in front of a mike. I miss spelled streets similar to spelling "you" "chu" . Come on folks this is not even audable english. I bought Tracy Chapmans new one at the same time and WHAT a contrast. Macy Grey is going to the used dc store.
1	Talking all night long: I sat up all night. I talk to this beautiful lady I met all night long while this, and a few other few slow jams played.. I can tell you if you are in the mood to sip wine, talk about life, and get closer to someone toss this cd on the spinner, and open your mind. If you want to hear something that is close, goto mp3, look up "d.a. young" and listen to "father's father's house." You will not be sorry. =)
1	Macy Gray is one of the best: I loved that song I TRYED and the rest is really good too. I am looking forward to buying her album
0	Puh-lease!: I can't turn my radio fast enough when I hear "I Try" coming on. It's like a car wreck. You don't want to see it, you have to turn forcefully away, and if you do see it it will haunt you. Her voice is ABOMINABLE, like fingernails on a chalkboard. The fact that anyone likes her is more proof that if you're just over-the-top horrible, some people will take it as a sign of greatness. Get Biz Markie as your vocal coach, have some songs written professionally for you, and you too could be a star.
1	Gray Matters: This is a strong, unique debut from such a super talent. Macy Gray growls with that she-ra soul, that Tina-Earth-Kitt, lazy groove Billie Holiday in a funked out, disco-ready, rhymthic blues sorta way. Macy may not be for everyone but that doesn't mean this sista is a one hit wonder. With the radio play of superifical, dry, booty songs, Macy Gray is a refreshing taste for those who want to hear some soul. For those who wanna hear that skreeching voice that sounds almost unreal, possibly surreal. This is for those who wanna expand in what they call music. Who don't pry themselves by the standards of what is current and pop. This for those who want something with spice, class, sass, and appeal. Macy Gray soars with her brand of old-school remixed with new school funk. That neo-funk, that makes your favorite 70's albums proud.
0	Turkey Rather Than One Star:: What's wrong with Hollywood? Just like the pure idea alone of Silence of the Limbs would amaze you well enough, the idea of this movie will, oppositely, sicken you all the way. Remember The Watcher (badly enough in its own rights), would be a classic comparing with this one.I am still confused why good actors like these two would take on a project like this. After two hours of viewing, not only careful consideration of choosing future title is needed, but also watching some boxing just to drive away the disgust this movie left.
0	the dishwasher !!: I could tolerate most of the illogical anguished drama (hell, I could forgive Charlize Theron anything), but then they lost me completely with the dishwasher!!
0	Pretty much what you'd expect: I was marginally curious about this film when I saw the trailer, but definitely unwilling to pay to view it. Fortunately, it came on HBO while I was staying in a hotel, and I could watch for free. It was largely what I expected - fairly worthless. Keanu Reeves performed better than he historically has, but Charlize Theron was fairly flat. Though the premise was marginally interesting, the plot is completely predictable. One bright spot was Jason Isaacs as Chaz/Cherry, who delivers his usual caliber of excellence. It did jerk the obligatory tear from me at the end, but that's largely because I'm easy that way. Four yawns and two stars.
0	Have no interest in it: I just got this for my class and I just not interested about other people. I'm more interested in creating things than reading about it.
0	Help your Dog Fight Cancer: This is the most informative book I've ever read on the subject. Also a very moving story which I will read over and over again!The info on veterinarians, oncologists and web-sites is incredable!A MUST buy, also for those whose dogs do NOT have cancer.
1	great camera: a great camera to take with you every day takes great pictures and takes up no room in your pocket
1	Best game I've ever played: If you like video games this game is a must have. It features awesome graphics and is 3D. If you can get only one game for your Game Cube get this one!!!Pacman has always been my favorite game except it has been in 2D this is the1st Pacman Game I've Played that is actually in 3D!!!VERY long game that takes weeks to beat!!!tHE BOTTOM LINE IS TO BUY THIS GAME!!!
0	The movie was positively dreadful: I didn't have high hopes for this film, seeing how it was a bomb at the box office. Now I know why. Seems they put a lot of money into effects and then just let Will Ferrell and Danny McBride kinda improv through the entire thing. They miss more than they hit, that's for sure. I imagine if you were sitting a room of half drunk frat boys, it'd be hilarious, but I barely cracked a smile through the whole thing. It's unfortunate also that the old series was family oriented and this is barely one step below R-rated humor. Skip this film (like most people did when it came out) and rent the original series instead.
0	Maybe the worst movie I've ever seen: Land of the Lost stars Will Ferrell, as Rick Marshall, a scientist. It was so bad, I left the theater 20 minutes into it. First off, what's up with the cheesy special effects? (aliens) I guess that's supposed to be funny, but it's not. Right before I walked out, a dinosaur was running after them, and they stoped to take a picture, so that they had proof, of this new world. Yeah. I will tell you straight up that I'm not a Will Ferrel fan, so maybe this wasn't for me. But this is so utterly dull, uninteresting, boring, and idiotic, that I couldn't even watch it.
0	... really?: Will Ferrell has been in some hilariously wonderful movies. Elf, Talladega Nights, Blades of Glory... but this movie is NOT one of them. It was just... holy mother of god! Yes, this movie was supposed to be funny... but it failed on pretty much every level. The acting is awful and so is the writing. The only reason I saw this was because it was playing on TV several nights ago, and I am glad I did not pay to see it.
0	stay away from this movie: I have seen many movies,and I am a huge Will Ferrel fan.Will got paid too much in this "piece of c--p" movie. There wasn't any plot. The story was all over the place. They threw in some dinosaurs, and a pool scene. Why sit around and watch junk, you will thank me later that you passed this stupid movie up. If you want to see Will in the only good movie he has made. See Stranger Than Fiction. Even his most recent movie was a flop. I consider a flop when you experience "forced laughter". The recent movie I am mantioning is The Other Guys. take care and happy viewing.
0	Warped tale should get lost and stay there: Short Attention Span Summary (SASS):1. Bad dialogue2. Bad acting3. Bad script4. Bad movie - bad, bad movie!Need I say more?Ferrell and company lamely limp their way through this uninspired big screen version of a seventies' TV series.So horrid are the dialogue and plot that this movie makes Brendan Fraser's "Journey to the Center of the Earth" look like a National Geographic special.The end result of watching this tale of a time-warp -adventure-gone-stupid is a splitting headache from trying to keep your eyebrows in your head.This is one that should remain lost.Amanda Richards, September19, 2009
0	Two hours of my life wasted: If you are a fan of the original TV series you will be sorely disappointed. This movie bears little resemblance to the TV show other than character names and some sleestak. If you are not familiar with the TV series and have no expectations then you might find it mildly entertaining if you have a "simple" sense of humor. But anyone with more than half a brain is likely to consider this movie really dumb.
0	Horrible! Absolutly horrible! Worst movie ever!: Horrible, stupid, its Will Ferril's best yet! This was the DUMBEST movie we have EVER seen(even worse than Freedom State)!!! Don't waste your money! Will Ferril is an amazingly stupid actor. If you have a brain the size of a walnut you will enjoy this movie!(If your brain is any bigger please do not watch, it will destroy your brain cells)My IQ is now 60...it used to be125.
0	Terrible and a waste of time and money: This is the worst movie you will ever watch...no plot, no story, terrible casting and nothing to do with the original series. Ugh. It sucks.
0	1 star =1 laugh: this movie was terrible. the dialog seemed as if it was written by a high school student, the plot devices were more than contrived, they were ridiculous. there was1 good laugh in this movie. it was such a poorly made movie i had no desire to watch the extra features. i just wanted to get the dvd out of my player. thank god i rented this piece of garbage instead of buying it.if you liked the first one, you may like this. i thought the first one was marginally funny. i personally think i'm too intelligent for this movie. the humor was soporific and generally appeals to the LCD in everyone. it just so happens my LCD is way above most people Highest Common Denominator.whatever.
1	A VERY FUNNY SEQUEL TO AMERICAN PIE!: I got a VCD of this movie from my friend (which was in terrible quality) and thought it was hilarious. I even invited a couple of girl friends over to watch it with me, and they liked it. I of course saw the R-Rated version and thought it was good. But now I have seen the Unrated version and it is 6 minutes funnier! Altogether this is an awesome DVD to own, with10 hours of bonus features and it looks great in the full-frame format. I can't wait to own this movie!
1	A Better Pie: American Pie 2 was an excellent sequel to the first American Pie movie. The story is pretty simple. Everyone's now in College, and for the Summer Vacation, the guys try to make it the best one Ever!To me AP2 is even better than the first. American Pie contained more of the everyday sexual encounters that teenage comedies now have. When I saw the first movie I wasn't really up for it because I already knew what was going to happen (except for the bedroom part). But, For American Pie 2, I was really surprised that even though it still had sexual situations (which I thought was even funnier that the first) it also had heart.It really made me realise that the characters have grown up and are taking things a bit more seriously. From their relationship with friends and family.This Second Pie is totally a must-see to anyone who's seen the first.
0	this cant be happening: I cant believe that a sequel came out for american piesame tasteless humorsame story linesame starssame everythingthis is just another attempt by filmakers to make high schoolers think that when they go to "college" its going to be one beer guzzling party after another and they will get through their first year with flying colorsI know this because it brainwashed a buncha of students at my school, always trying to get laid, into parties and how much they will enjoy their "freedom" in collegebad movie
1	Hilarious!: Irreverant comedy at its finest! The sequel was better than the original, and I loved the original! The actors were great, but I was really impressed with Alyson Hannigan in this flick. She was able to make her band geek character funny and deep. I noticed that she appeared in more of the outtakes than any other actor/actress. I look forward to seeing more of her work. This is on my greatest comedy list forever!
1	Fusion jazz gem from the masters: This hard to find CD is a must for fans of fusion jazz. The groundbreaking quartet of Chick Corea, Stanley Clarke, Al DiMeola, and Lenny White provide the true fusion of rock and jazz with the hard driving "Earth Juice" and "Vulcan World". And then the solo piano of the title tune provides a surpassingly sweet moment of peace. Along with their classic Romantic Warrior and Weather Report's "Heavy Weather" this CD is a classic of early-mid-70's fusion jazz.
0	This DVD has not been released yet: Despite what it says on hmv.ca - the title Deceived has not been received. I ordered it two months ago and was just informed that I wouldnt get it until late January - little do they know that hmv.com says the release is Feb14/04. Why dont they figure it out and change the availability - it will not ship in 2-6 weeks cause it doesnt exist! yet.
0	More like The Snore.: OK, it's Corman so you gotta cut him some slack, but this one couldn't terrify a tourist in Disneyland. Karloff is you're typical SOB--Scary Old Baron; Nicholson's a miscast as a lovestruck Napoleanic officer (French lieutenant? Stick to LA gumshoe, Jake.); and what about that Community Theater witch?! Maybe they should have burned the sets down while filming--a la Gone with the Wind--in order to add some excitement to this one.
0	A caveat to DVD purchasers: WARNING to anyone thinking of purchasing the D-Vision DVD edition of THE TERROR: It is not the letterbox edition touted in Amazon's writeup (my sole reason for ordering it). REPEAT: It is not widescreen; it is in full-screen format, and appears to have been mastered from an EP VHS source.
1	Humourous Insight: Potpourri of life is a poetic and humourous look in the problems that so many of us face in our everyday lives. When is the second book coming?
0	Leave your brain and taste at the door: "Danger Kitty" has mass produced some of the worst music in the history of Pop. To all of the BJ fans out there, look up the word, "cliche". Understand its danger and the shallow nature that this word connotes. It's ahem !! like a "wet, slippery, loaded gun". If you're going to write lyrics this horrible, juvenile and unimaginative, why bother finishing Junior High at all. Drop out of school, get yourself a job at Hot Dog on a Stick and say goodbye to every one of your brain cells. Patriotism demands that you rid your CD player of anything that makes you look like you couldn't finish the 4th grade. Do it for your country!
0	So incredibly overrated..: Bon Jovi are in close competition with Nirvana for the "Most Overrated Band in History" award. If I had a dollar for every time I heard the cr@ppy "Living on a Prayer" played on the radio, I'd be able to retire in comfort, and I'm only 21! I can only reccommend this album to people who like to annoy themselves with $hitty music.
0	Wow was this bad!: I just got back from seeing this terrible, terrible movie and felt the need to share my feelings in a review. Nothing about this movie was enjoyable. From the opening scene with the crowd of the jousting match singing We Will Rock You, I knew I was in trouble. There should surely be a rule about using 70s rock anthems in movies about jousting that are set before1970, or for any movies about jousting. I now understand why there have been so few jousting movies out, because it's boring. Once you see one person get knocked off their horse, you've seen it all. This movie is acted horribly, written horribly, and directed horribly. Save your money and go buy a best of 70s Rock compilation album instead.
0	Ridiculous!: This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Heath Ledger, as a lead actor, is terrible. In fact, all the actors in this movie are extremely bad. The story is poor and ridiculous. On the other side, if it had not been for a movie like this one, we would not be able to fully appreciate a good movie. Therefore, take my advice- do not rent this movie! It goes without saying that this movie deserves much criticism as there are many flaws and shortcomings. In conclusion, if you see this movie I can assure you that you will be disappointed.
1	Don't buy the "Extended" Edition!: If you're a fan of Brian Helgeland, Paul Bettany (Chaucer), or just commentary tracks in general, don't buy the extended edition. The regular DVD has every feature the "extended" edition does - it just doesn't insert the deleted scenes into the movie. They're included as bonus features. This extended edition does not include the hilarious and insightful commentary track by Helgeland and Bettany, which is really the best thing about the DVD. You get more features for less money by buying the regular DVD release.
0	Save Your Money: This movie ranks right next to Red Tomahawck as one of the worst movie I have seen. The acting is not bad but the story was as cliche ridden as the fifth sequeal to a Rocky movie. You see better stories in old Tarzan movie's. How many time's can you watch a knight get struck while riding a horse. Heath Ledger is the Babe Ruth of knight's. There are no odd's he cannot overcome and man those he overcome the odd's. Superman better watch out. Now if Sylvester Stallone was a knight then you would have a contest. Give your money to a charity or pay off an old debt and avoid this rubbish.
1	The Best: I saw this movie and LOVED IT!!!! It was the best ever. The soundtrack is really good too. The characters are well delveloped. In my opinion it is a football movie but with horses and lances. This is my all time favorite movie!
1	Rock and Roll Jousting: The soundtrack is a character all its own in this film. This is the story of a poor young boy who grows up in the shadow of a jousting champion, who like all champions must one day face the fact that he can no longer be the best.The boy's father is his hero, even though he basically sells him into servitude. He tells his son he can change his destiny, that nothing should stand in his way.This boy lives by those words. This is a typical story of society boundaries and poor boy meets rich girl. With the added character of classical rock and roll matched with medieval backdrop, you'll sit rivoted to your seat anticipating the realistic jousting matches and playing name that tune!
0	Drivel: OK, what a waste of time, don't get me wrong I love horror movies just as much as the next fiend, but this one takes the cake for stupidity. How can you make a horror movie that is so utterly devoid of suspence? I feel sorry for teens who think that today's horror movies are actually scary, they should check out Hallaween and Friday the13th to see how it's really done. I guarantee that if they saw Michael Myers or Jason delivering spine shattering blows upon thier victims and death from above they would change their tunes.
0	Nobody want's to be this Mama's boys Valentine.: Your typical, average, unoriginal masked man killing off people that he doesn't like. Not only that, People that don't like him. That don't love him. This whole things has been done to death and I'm sick of it. Enough with the killer's in masks. Many others have come before this one. Some where more entertaining than others but still, give it a rest already. Nothing is done different and everything is flawed in this movie. It's a complete waste of time.Here's a list of all the others that seem EXACTLY similiar to this undying tune:1. I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER2. I STILL KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER3. SCREAM4. SCREAM 25. SCREAM 36. HIGHSCHOOL DEATH7. THE ENTIRE JASON VORHEES SERIES8. THE ENTIRE MICHAEL MEYERS SERIES9. URBAN LEGEND10. URBAN LEGENDS: FINAL CUTfINAL vERDICT: This deserves to be forgotten.
1	The best moddern day horror film of them all!: Let me start out by saying that this movie will make the easily scared piss their pants! The origionality of this film is so hard to come by these days. When a group of attractive young girls humiliate a nerd at the valentines day dance, he vows revenge on all of them.13 years later they recieve thretening valentines and gifts. The gift that Jessica Cauffiel's character Lily gets will make the squeamish throw up! Anyway, One by one they are hunted down by a crazed killer wearing a cupid mask. Very creative death scenes including arrows, power drills, shards of glass, axes and more. Great soundtrack too! I rate it an A+! Stars Denise Richards, Marly Shelton, Jessica Cauffiel, Jessica Capshaw, Kathrine Heigel, Hedy Burress and David Boreanza.
0	Tom Savage should sue: This is possibly the worst book to movie transition I have ever seen. Whereas the book was a five star thriller, the movie is just another cheap slasher film with absolutely nothing to redeem it from the crap that it is. I have been disappointed many times by movies made from books I have read, but never on this grand a scale. Tom Savage has written only a handful of books, but they are all edge-of-your-seat thrillers, so I was very excited to hear "Valentine" was being made into a movie. And if it had been made properly it would have been good. Instead, a horrible script in the hands of a truly terrible director turned this masterpiece into a shameful mess. I urge everyone who saw this movie and hated it as much as I did to read the book. It is nothing like the movie. In fact I recently reread the book and realized, with the exception of the title, the book is an entirely different story. If you have not seen the movie, don't waste your time, read the book instead.
0	This game sucks: Yes, the graphics are goods but this game sucks big time. I rented it and I'm glad thats all I did.Tip to the people who are considering on buying this game, rent it first because you don't want to get stuck with this game.
0	HUH>?: I rented this game expecting some fast and furious gameplay, the truth is, is that thats all you get. No statistics or roster changes!!!! Thats a major blow, besides that it has dumb gimics like when you have to play against a team of dolphins... WHY??? I recommend renting it first, the graphics are the only good thing about it, all you do is play play play, it gets pretty redundant and boring after a while, with no stats or rosters to look at.
0	Extremly desapointing!!: I first read "Kane & Abel" also by J. Archer, this one book was so good that even though I know that second parts are not as good as first parts I wanted to read it.This turn out to be an incredibly disapointing book, so much that I had to make a huge effort to keep reading and dont put the book on the trash.More than half of the book only repeats what we already knew from "Kane & Abel", and the rest was just the worst plot ever.How can someone writte so well first and then just be the worst writter ever?I just regret to have buy this book in the first place.
0	Soap opera: This is a soap opera. If you enjoy reading about romanticized daily life you will no doubt find this book interesting.I was expecting an action novel. It isn't here. I waded through about half the book and then gave up. I just could not maintain any interest in the continueing lives of Florentyna and Richard.I'm sure they went on to even greater fame and fortune...I just don't care.
1	Recommendation with Enthusiasm: Before reaching the end of this novel, it had already moved into the position of being one of my favorite books of all time. It is engaging from the first page until the final sentence. I could not put it down. This is the type of book that makes you want to read everything else the author has written, because if any of his other books even come close to this they will be amazing. For anyone looking to read this I would definitely recommend reading Kane and Abel beforehand. The two novels complement each other very well, and you cannot have the complete story if you only read one.
0	Lost interest after the hot tub scene.: This movie had plenty of laughs, but I lost all interest after the two naked men pull owen wilson from the hot tub. Could have totally done without seeing that. If you can overlook that scene then I guess it was an alright move, maybe 31/2 stars.
0	Since When Does ONE Deleted Scene = "Special Features?": If you loved this movie and want the DVD for the outrageous special features you can't get on rental DVDs - outtakes, bloopers, commentary, interviews, behind the scenes, etc - DON'T BOTHER! The "special features" (which I can't believe they had the nerve to make plural) include ONE deleted scene. ONE. Why even bother??? Save yourself some money and buy a previous rental copy. Note to the studio: if you're planning a "special edition" in the future with all these features in the hopes of getting my money twice...it's not happening.
1	Great purchase: I chose to buy this during the Black Friday deals weekend and it's a great purchase! This was a great purchase!
1	Good Movie,: Seen this with my girl friend and she wanted the movie for ever. We ordered this and it showed up the same day as it was released.
0	Not as funny as I expected: This movie fails on many levels to deliver on what I expected to be a much funnier outing for Wilson. The movie falls down on humor and really overall quality. Don't get me wrong - there are some funny moments but they are few and further between than I would have liked. I didn't like the characters enough to care what happened to them and I didn't believe what happened to them when it did happen. The blonde is not believable and she is unlikely as the realistic sexual interest for Owen Wilson (unless he is OWEN WILSON - ACTOR and not the character in the movie).This is not a movie that I will watch again. Better than Bad Teacher - MUCH MUCH MUCH worse than Wedding Crashers (my benchmark film in this genre).
0	a very disappointing movie.: whats up with hollywood? what a big disappointment. I want watch another movie that Peter Farrelly directs or if he's even is involved with it.
0	Sucked: Some funny parts here and there, but mostly sucked. It definitely wasn't worth paying to watch, I wouldn't watch it again, but if you could get it free, it might be ok.
1	HIGHEST Recommendation: I loved every word of this book. Knock your socks off story, rich characters, and as about as relevant as you can possibly get. Will now go read more of this writer's books and hope their half as good.
1	Best of a Classic: He may be old, but this is an exceptionally rockin slab of fun. One of the outstanding rockers of all time successfully translates his live show to the studio. Every song is dynamite, and very well recorded.
0	This book was just terrible: I think my title says it all, but I'll add a few reasons why. Bad writing, unappealing characters with no characterization at all (actually, that's a bit of a feat - how did Woods manage that?)trite dialogue, idiotic plot. Need I say more? I guess I'm especially bitter because I was trapped on a five hour flight, had already seen the movie being shown and all I had to read was this book. I wanted to parachute out of the plane. I see that used copies of this book are available for one cent. Save your penny.
0	Buy the Update: I bought this book for $250 and I also bought "How to Create and Manage a Mutual Fund or Exchange-Traded Fund" 9780470120552 for ~$70. This book was paper back and the "How to create..." book was hardback and copy written 3 years later (2008 compared to 2005 of this book.) The words are mostly the same on the mutual fund side, but they have added exchange traded funds into the book. All the graphs are updated and it is written by the same author.
0	Did I just get a lemon?: I find the reviews that extol this as a long-serving workhorse quite interesting -- and frustrating. I had this chopper and used it only about a half dozen times, though had it over a year. It just stopped working. B&D customer service didn't even express regret at my experience and refused to do anything about it. Since I had a B&D toaster oven (almost $100 on sale) that also gave out after just over a year, I won't be buying any more of their products.
0	Junk: Creates mush, and not uniform either, big chunks and mush. I wanted it to chop up peppers and like foodstuffs.
0	Frustrating and ineffective.: I find this chopper to be frustrating and ineffective. Food is always getting under the blades, pushing them up so that the blade is no longer caught by the drive shaft. This happens chopping something as easily chopped as onions, so forget having any success at the harder items, like nuts!The button is also very difficult to press. My young children used to help out on the kitchen by using the mini-chopper, but everyone except my 9 year old are unable to do so.I'm shopping for a new model...and hoping for better luck!
1	chopper/mincer: This Black & Decker chopper/mincer although small provides an excellent service for us. Perhaps we are easily satisfied because of the size of our hosehold, there are only two of us but we have no complaints about the efficiency and effectivenessBlack & Decker HC3061-1/2-Cup One-Touch Electric Chopperof this purchase.
1	Infrequent Chopper: I don't cook much but when I do, I hate having to chop everything and this little guy is a big help in the kitchen.
0	The Black & Decker Chopper Plus.: The Black & Decker Chopper Plus did not work if you put more than1/2 the container full of your ingredient. I was not happy with the product. I have had one for years and it works alot better than this one, but I had lost the blade to it and had to purchase this one.
1	Great: I work at a fire dept, so as we are known for I am always cooking. This makes cutting vegetables so easy. Within seconds you can have them cut. I can't believe I didn't buy one of these sooner.
0	The worst chopper I have ever used, from the first use!: We had high expectations with this, based on other reviews.We make pesto for home use with our old one that was my grandmothers for we don't know how long. Grandmother's was a different brand too.Anyways. We opened it, put the stuff in to make a small batch of pesto and we had to trash that batch and the chopper started smoking, as if it were overloaded.It's bad if you need to chop anything more than water, and even then, I think it would be bad at it.
0	Don't watch this movie!: This movie is total Bull! anybody who claims to like it, is probably faking it. The people who appreciate this movie, are probably like those who go to an Art Exhibition and appreciate Picaso's paintings, even though they know that the paintings are total Bull! hahathe other movies of Coen Brothers rock! but this movie is total bull!I hope nobody goes thru the same pain I did while watching this movie.Bottom line: This movie has no story! really! so, if you wanna spend time watching a good movie, then this movie is NOT for you!
0	dissapointing: The book is pretty good, though nowhere near as good as the Godfather. While the book keeps a secret that brings everything together until the very end, the movie bizarrely gives the secret away in the first10 minutes. I realize you don't have as much time to work with in a movie/TV series, but this makes everything fairly predictable. Lots of lame acting as well, even by otherwise-good actors.
0	dull and pointless: This movie starts off like a mystery/thriller, but quickly becomes a slow-moving and ultimately unsatisfying attempt at a character study. Do not watch it expecting to see a cop movie, or anything other than nicholson playing drunk.
0	Bad Movie: Typical excellent acting by Nicholson, but the movie was SLOW, poorly organized and had nothing besides Nicholson. The ending was very poorly done.
0	Just bad: Jack Nicholson turns in a great performance in this slow plodding movie.Jack clearly made this movie as a favor to his friend Sean Penn.Penn should stick to acting.The cut aways the distracting music,very disapointed.
1	Classroom Teacher Loved It: The first time I heard this book was while I was a guest teacher in second grade classroom. A parent choose to read this book to the class and they were enthralled. They could not take their eyes off the book and they could not stop talking about it afterwards. The next week when I was filling in for the librarian I decided to read this book to the third graders. They loved it partly because it was a new book to add to their holiday favorites. I wanted to add it to my library before the holidays but the book was nowhere to be found, except online. I was devasted but I will be ready to share this book with all my students next year.
0	Don't buy: Stay away from baseball game this year. Without MVP baseball having the mlb license, the games just aren't worth the time and money. MLB the show, has terrible game play and overall isn't fun to play. I bought MLB the show one night and sold it the next. MVP basebal sucks with the college players so don't buy that either.
1	Great Game: It is a great game. The rosters are updated really good. Except it doesn't have my favorite baseball player Barry Bonds. There is a lot of new gane modes like Rivalry Mode. I like Franchise mode a lot it's fun.I thought MLB 2K6 would be better but it's not I rated it 5 stars to. I think you should get MLB06 THE SHOW if you like really realistic games but get MLB 2K6 if you like kind of realistic games but is real easy.
1	What are you waitn' for?: Hey everbody this Cd is awesome...the girls rock, and don't give this CD any second thoughts! Make sure to listen to Say my Name, Bugaboo, and Bills, Bills, Bills!
1	great album: I really like this album. "So Good" is a really good upbeat song, "Bills, Bills, Bills" is a cool song about a bad relationship about a guy who takes things from them to be cool, "Confessions" isn't exactally the best song that could be on the album and Missy Elliot is kinda the backup singer in the song and it's redundant. "BUGABOO" is the BEST SONG ON THE WHOLE ALBUM! It has a great beat and is one you will repeat on the album. "Temptation" talks about how there's a guy they wan't but they already have boys. The last songs were what made me think twice about giving them 5 stars. The songs have annoying beats upset for the Outro. If you are a DC fan buy this album. I own both albums and the Destiny's Child today hasn't had another album in awhile.i saw them on tour a while ago and they were so awesome.
0	an OK album, not great: This was not as good as I had hoped and half of it is too slow to listen to while I am working out but the rest is good.
1	COOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL!: I thought this CD was sooooo cool. At first, i didn;t think I'd like it becuase I'm a pretty big BSB/NSync/98 degrees/5ive fan, but I thought I'd give it a try. Woah! I was blown away! The tracks are cool, the lyrics are cool, Destiny's Child is cool! You've gotta get it!
1	One of the best Courtroom Dramas: Amazing screenplay put on screen. A three hour journey back into the JFK controversy which shook up America and the world. Costner in rare form gives an unbelievable performance. A must see.
1	Most Accurate Movie Ever: Everybody should watch this movie it is an enlightening accurate depiction of the facts surrounding Kennedy's Assassination with a companion published book of sources it is certainly the most historically accurate film hollywood has come out with to date.
1	Blew my mind.: I relived the same moments JFK had.And Oliver Stone saying that "JFK was never meant to leave Dallas alive."Not just chilling, but so bone-chilling that it took me a long time to sleep.For sheer effect, it is on same par as ConspiracyConspiracymovie.The way each fact is researched thoroughly, the rattling inside the team of DA, and Jim's reaction to Robert Kennedy's assasination, my God.
0	Poor history, bad acting, terrible movie: This is truly a bad movie....The historical "premise" is incorrect. JFK expanded the war in Vietnam, and there is no reason to believe that he would have changed his mind if he had not been assasinated. The conspiracy plot is laughable. I did not think it was possible for me to feel sympathy for Lyndon Johnson, a failure as President, but the movie almost invoked those feelings by portraying him as a conspirator against JFK. Kevin Costner is awful as Garrison. His accent is amateurish, for example. Tommy Lee Jones is the only actor who puts in a credible performance.
1	So, you don't buy Stone's conspiracy theory?: Whether or not the film answers the questions surrounding the death of President Kennedy, it does boast bravura performances from Tommy Lee Jones, Donald Sutherland, Kevin Bacon, and, in a small yet memorable cameo, Larry Hagman. John Williams also contributes a very subtle yet powerful score, simultaneously ominous and poignant.
0	Some good advice, but not worth buying: I started reading this book, and while it seems to have some good points, the writing is pretty bad (strange for a book on writing to be poorly written). She keeps repeating herself over and over, about how successful she is. While trying to inspire, she is also depressing, that it may take years or decades to get yourself established. I don't think so...sounds like she's just trying to make money from this book, yet wants to discourage any new competition! Take my advice and buy the "Well Fed Writer" by Peter Bowerman. His advice is better, his writing is funny and very readable, and he doesn't speak to the reader like they're a moron. Which Flynn does, by the way.
0	dull!: its a dull film- theres not nearly enough JRM in it as id liked and some unknown reason we keep getting these pictures of rivers and babies and this Adam and Eve duo! does anyone understand what its about except the director?
1	Gotta see it to believe it.: 2001: A Space Odyssey meets Blue Velvet. It's as carefully paced and music-laden as the former, as far from redemption as the latter. Don't read any blurbs or summaries, just watch it.
0	B.S., B.S., B.S.!!!!!!!!!: The idea of this movie has got to be the biggest crock of *!%#. Science tells us that the first woman and man were AFRICAN, so why do we have a White woman playing "Eve"??? One can clearly see the explicit attempt to mock and separate the holy union between an African man and woman. First, the Egyptians were white and now Eve????? Give me a break. I'm just glad I have the knowledge to see through this trash.
0	DON'T BUY THIS VERSION: Don't make the mistake i did by buying this copy of this classic ITALIAN movie.It's a complete disaster with faded colors and grainy images.I can't beleive they put this one on the market.You'll get to see the three sketches all right, but the transfer is simply amateurish and insulting.No subtitles,not even the original ITALIAN track,no gallery of photos etc.This is the worst dvd i ever bought.Luckily for others,a new version was released in 2005 which has the proper treatment.I just hope that VISCONTI's last movie THE INNOCENT won't fall in this category when they released it someday.Let us pray for the preservation of LAURA ANTONELLI's beauty.
0	Dumb As Hell , But Watchable: Soldier is one of those films that was just made to be poked fun at. Everything about this film is familiar. The plot is basically Escape From New York meets The Road Warrior. Russell and Busey deserve better than this. The action is a joke, and the acting is hilarious. Just watch this to laugh.
0	Lied about the size: We love this movie and it was listed as1:77 in size. When we recieved it the size was 2:35. This is call bait and switch. Shoppers don,t buy this movie unless you want to watch the movie with the heads cut off .
0	Whiz Bang Ending But it misses the mark.: Well after watching a wonderfully violent, strangely poetic ending I found myself liking this film alot more than I did the first hour into it. They try to make us like the main character who has no personality and they try to make us care for the community he falls into, but the film is so full of cliches and poor characterization that the first hour meanders and the ending though fun and exciting , a bit more hollow than I'd like.
0	Boring!!!!!!!!!!!: Kurt was pulling a arnold job. I think he had about two lines of dialoge through out the intire movie. The story is pretty good.I'm sorry I purchased it. Should have rented it first.
0	Stay Away!: My experience with this device was horrible. It took weeks to get it to work right, I spent hours on the phone with tech support who couldn't figure out why. Finally the "master tech" spoke to "the designers" and they sent me some software update which made it work. However this was after 2 replacements that all failed to work (Windows XP)Even once it workd it turned out that the software is incompatible with Vista.And when I had to wipe my XP computer and wanted to reinstall it, I found that all software download link were removed from smarthome's web site, leaving me with a useless wall wart.BUYER BEWARE: STAY AWAY!
1	The Shop Around the Corner: They don't make romantic comedies like they used to, and no one made them quite like director Ernst Lubitsch, whose famed "touch" lights this wry, poignant, perennially charming film. Veteran players Stewart and Sullavan are a perfect match as comically antagonistic lonelyhearts, conveying their characters' vulnerabilities with a delicacy too often missing from the tepid Hanks-Ryan remake, "You've Got Mail". Rich subplots involving the wonderful Frank Morgan and Joseph Schildkraut, who plays a scheming, boastful employee, let Lubitsch impart further nuance to this modest but wholly pleasing tale. A delight from start to finish, this is one "Shop" you'll want to dally in.
1	What You've Got Mail Should Have Been: With an ensemble cast that could only exist when the studio system was in full flower, this classic film unites Stewart with friend Henry Fonda's wife in a charming and quirky romance tour de force. It's easy to see why they team that transmuted Affair to Remember into Sleepless in Seattle thought they could recapture the magic of big box office. But it was impossible for Hanks and Ryan to live up to the charm and allure of Sullivan or Stewart. This film must be in the library of anyone who admires excellence and a joyful celebration of love.
1	Corner Shop review: wonderful movie! Classic Jimmie Stewart. Great for the entire family to watch. If you enjoyed "You've Got Mail" with Ryan and Hanks, you should enjoy this movie - it's a similar storyline, though with snail mail, not email.
1	Excelente livro!: Uma rápida olhada no índice do livro atestam que estou diante de um conteúdo bastante promissor. O papel e a impresso deixam a desejar. A encadernao é frágil para o tamnho do livro.
1	I echo the 5-star rating of this book: I was introduced to this book by staff at my local children's book store. I was intrigued with the concept of the book being written from the perspective of a boy's journal, as I glanced through it before buying it. That night I read it, and it will be one of the jewels in my bookcase. It is a tremendous way of introducing young people to poetry and is just a charming story!!! LOVE THIS BOOK!!!
1	Love that Book!: It's a charming, delightful, true book about10 yo boys and poetry. My10yo boy agrees with most of it (he's not quite as in love with poetry by the end, but he's getting there) I would recommend this to anyone with a child struggling to appreciate poetry but especially to boys. It's so loving and light filled. It's a delightful book and a real treasure. We're keeping it!
0	Simply disappointing! I don't recommend this album to anyone!: It seems that all the energy, the "music stamina" Al Jarreau had, is definitely gone. I waited until I could read all the comments on this album, then bought it. Wasted money! If you're expecting to find more of the magnificent Jazz & Pop exercises Al Jarreau did in "Breakin' Away", "Jarreau" or "L Is For Lover", just forget it...!!! This album is for dark-Jazz & Blues fans only. Anyway, Jarreau's voice sounds simply murky and boring.
1	Authour recreates his own life story.: Neil Albert's "monthly series" continues in its 6th entery. This time Dave Garret is set out to solve a totaly different case. He is looking for his biological parents.The author states that this is based on his search for his birth parents and that brings a more human emotion to the story itself.Alberts intertwining chapters of different naratives actually gives two interesting prespectives to the same story.As the story opens we find Dave in his office with nothing to do, basicly jobless buy with a job. Until he is presued to find his father, his biological father. He sets out to California where his mother stayed during her pregnancy with her family. He hopes he will be able find the truth there but it leads to nowhere. With a twist of fate and a confession Dave is sent on the right track and you are left with a great mystery.
1	A Classic from an Early Hippie Band: The themes of the songs may seem dated to younger listeners, but this album still holds up as the music is fun, interesting and excellent. This was one of the first Hippie bands, and therefore may sound super-outdated to young listeners today, but give it a chance; you won't be sorry. The vocals from these guys are always interesting and enjoyable, even downright beautiful. They are quirky and wonderful, as is this CD.
1	Excellent CD!: I only recently learned about this band. This greatest hits CD contains lots of the songs played on satellite radio while I'm driving to work. Great band ! I love the singer. I only wish they were not broken up. An excellent bargain for a fan, new or old!
1	Very good: The cd was purchased as a Christmas gift and I assume everything was fine with it. Your service was excellent and was received in a timely manner. Thank you
1	Full Poster Sized: Nice poster for a violin teachers room. It would make a nice chart for beginners. Really everything on the chart is in your beginning books, but stuck up on the wall, it can help teach the students. This is a full sized poster, not a little chart.
0	even schwarzenegger must hope this one goes away: with voice by someone other than arnold this movie falls into the realm of the if he weren't famous this one would never see the light of day. really the worst. skip it!
1	Better!: I liked this book a lot better then the previous one! I really liked how Christine really pursued God in what she should do concerning her relationship with Eric! Overall great read!
0	NOT worth10$: I bought this set a while ago because it looked unique and fun. Do not make the same mistake I made of buying it, it is not worth even10$! The exercises are extremely fast paced. What I mean by this is that he will show you a move for a split second then expect you to have it mastered so while they're dancing away a million miles a minute, you're stuck there still trying to figure out how to do the moves. My other problem is when I would do the resistance disc exercises, I honestly did not feel any shape or form of a burn meaning the exercise wasn't doing ANYTHING (and to top it off, I was using the most resistant band the set came with). I wasted money on this ridiculous program, shame on BeachBody for releasing this!
1	good product: really like this product. I would recommend this product if you are looking for this type of item for your computer needs.

0	Good ideas, bad execution: I bought this book because it had the largest and most creative selection of recipes, but that's just not good enough.After two failures today I referred back to some "old standards" and discovered that the proportion of flour to liquid is different by almost 3 ounces in some cases. The result was a sticky mess that could barely be corrected by adding more and more flour. In one case, adding flour never did compensate for the combinations of other ingredients (chocolate and orange segments).When I read the book more closely, I discovered that the author recommends standing by during mixing to make this adjustment on all the recipes. So much for having fresh bread ready when you wake up in the morning.The author's credentials seem good, but she doesn't understand the breadmaker's approach.I suppose I'll use the ideas in this book and adjust the liquid as needed, but it certainly won't replace the recipes that I've used for the past ten years. Too bad.
1	Great Bread Machine cookbook!: I bought this book for my son along with a bread machine. I almost kept this cookbook for myself and plan to buy one for me, too. Great variety of breads and doughs to choose from.
1	a treasure for bread lovers: I love this book, not only does it have great solid bread machine recipes, it also has some more challengins and unique breads you can play around with. I feel it elevates bread machine baking to a more artistic level in some ways. Highly recommed this book.
1	ProKeys 88SX - the real deal: This keyboard is a great little keyboard, 7 solid sounds, minimum frills, great price and easy to transport. I use it mainly for recording. It is not really what I would call a road-worthy board, but in a static set-up, it's perfect for me.
0	bored to death: at school last week we watched this movie, history class. It was exteamly borning. I learned noting and only was disgusted RENT THIS FIRST, PO
1	Definitive historical masterpiece: If you liked 'Last of the Mohicans', 'The Mission', or 'The New World', then read on. This film is relatively unknown in the UK, and sadly does not seem to be available in Region 2. If you can play films from other regions, I urge you to buy this veritable masterpiece. The haunting scenery, understated acting, and overwhelming authentic period feel, add up to a memorable cinema experience that will stay with you. The portrayal of the savage culture of the native American Indians can be hard to watch at times but the excellent cast draw you in to the story in a way seldom seen these days. Not a blockbuster or action film, this will reward the fan of historical drama, and those who can appreciate first class cinematography and photography. Don't be put off by the 'religious' theme, it is only part of a wider view on colonisation and faith.Serious cinema for the true film buff.
0	bleh x 5!: If someone wanted to write a book about Tolkien & Middle Earth, they should have researched a little better. Not *this* garbage! Tolkien was a CATHOLIC -- & a hard-liner at that. Catholic. Not Buddhist, not Pagan & certainly NOT Gnostic (sheesh! Some of this stuff in this book was hard to read because it was so WRONG)! Yes, he got some of his ideas from mythology (the myth part of the book is ok, I guess. But, there are so many *other* *better* books about myth out there than *this*... I know I've read better). But, the books are basically Catholic. Just read the Sil & you'll see what I mean! There's hardly *anything* in here about Tolkien's Catholic upbringing as it pertains to the books. If I want the *real* story on Tolkien & what he believed & wrote, I'll stick w/Tolkien's Letters & Joseph Pearce.I shouldn't have bought this book, but... well, I'm a sucker for anything Tolkien.....
1	Arthur enters the story line!: Jack Whyte does a superb job in this continuation of his version of the Arthur legend. This is the way Arthur really could have come to power. I've read this series (9 books in all) at least 5 times front to back and plan to read them again often at least once per year probably. I can't say enough good things about this author and this series!In this book Arthur enters the story (actually, he did that at the end of the previous book, The Saxon Shore in the closing pages). This series is just brilliant. The best and most credible retelling of the Arthur legend.
0	Romance in Disguise: When women write stories about mute girls who are saved by big, strong men who teach them to be sexually aware, that is considered Romance fiction and is looked down upon. But here we have the same formula: a mysterious young girl, beautiful and abused, unable to speak. A hero of mythical proportions comes to her rescue. Cassandra never felt real to me, because the author never lets her speak -- just another female character to manipulate and show the hero off to advantage.Historical fiction and historical detail are good things, when there are real characters to hold them up, and a real story to listen to. This book seesaws between long and tedious discussions of theology and Danielle Steele.
0	American TV in1944? Heh-heh-heh!: This WIN PRODUCTIONS DVD is curious and highly suspect.There was no AMOS 'N' ANDY TV show in1944, nor did Freeman Gosden and Charles Correll (pictured here all corked up) appear in the early 50s television sitcom. (Amos Jones was played by Alvin Childress and Andy 'Hogg' Brown was Spencer Williams.)The three episodes divided into parts on this item's Editorial Review ("Invisible Glass," "The Gun" and "Kingfish Gets Drafted") are single-episode programs that run 25 minutes each. As for "the best episodes of Amos & Andy," that's a matter of opinion. They're typical A&A; shows, to be sure.I doesn't know 'bout dis one, Andy!
0	I am missing something, right?: So this is a "London Times Funny Music Cartoons" mousepad that features Barry Gibb of laying on a psychiatrist's sofa quoting the beginning lyrics to...."I Started A Joke"???. But Barry doesn't sing a single note on the song which everyone knows is pretty much a Robin Gibb solo, so the selection of this lyric for this cartoon makes no sense. Clearly the artist was not very knowledgeable about the subject they were rendering a cartoon about. And oh yeah- how is this cartoon funny? I know the lyrics make no sense (many early Bee Gees lyrics don't), but how is this cartoon funny? The London Times actually published this at one time (I guess it was a slow news day. And now some 20 years later, I would want this cartoon as a mousepad because why?? Oh- and the actual lyric in the word balloon is wrong too.
0	Good Film Bad Version: This is sad, because as much as i love this film, i must give it one star. This is probably because of the DVD. This film is cut and censored. My point is the 2 most famous parts (The fetus eating and the eating of the organs) have been completly cut out. I think this was due to the rush of companies to get there movies on DVD. I should have known better when i didnt see the name Anthropopaguhs anywere on the box. Tisa Farrow is so hot and we should really get to see alot more of her in this movie (its done by Joe D'Amato the soft-core gore guy who did Ilsa and Emanuell films and we dont see any nudity at all in this film). I have the uncut version, the sequal Absurd and the lesser more cheap tribute and/or remake Anthropopagus 2000. Wait a while, im sure this will come out uncut some day...
1	its okay: Just remember when you buy this book that it's from Microsoft Press, so expect it to lean towards supporting the Microsoft Internet Explorer, with plenty of plugs accordingly - so some of the techiques in this book will not work on the Netscape browser - but these are clearly marked as such, so there shouldn't be any confusion. It comes with a CD ROM which helps you see what you are reading about and comes with a version of the MSIE that you can download. Its nice and easy to read and 'EVEN I' can understand it all
0	Aggressive Defense of Marriage: The Tender Trap is one of the most aggressive defenses of marriage ever seen in the movies. Carefree Frank Sinatra is bullied by depressed married friend David Wayne into leaving his happy bachelor life for the supposed solidity of married life. Frank is eventually roped by control-freak Debbie ("I don't care who I marry as long as I'm married by 22") Reynolds into a presumably happily ever after married future. A depressing movie that is barely redeemed by sympathetic performances by Sinatra and Celeste Holm. David Wayne's portrayal of a self-absorbed, cruel detached husband is o.k. in a thankless role. Debbie Reynold's character is truly frightening.
1	Simply Fantastic...: Radical Cure is the first book I've read by Olivia Gates...but, cetainly not my last. I'll be grabbing up her backlist asap!The previous reviews already provide the background for this book... I'll just add that this is an edgy, fast-paced, action-packed novel. I wouldn't limit it to a "medical thriller".Calista St. James is a smart, strong, capable woman and sparks fly when she is with Damian De Luna, a smart, sexy, capable man. The author not only writes intelligent 3-D characters, but she knows how to turn up the heat between these two.I think this book can be read as a stand-alone book, but I have already placed my order for Strong Medicine.
1	Another Great Book-To-Movie: One of my all-time favorites. Great locations, timeless story, excellent production values, and of course, a marvelous cast. No actor is mis-cast. The film never becomes maudlin or overly sentimental, though in another director's hand that might have happened. It simply tells the story the way Conrad told it.My DVD library won't be complete until this is added to it. When will it be released on DVD?
1	Superb Sequel!: If you liked the first volume of Cinema Serenade, you will love this one. It features beautiful, lush arrangements and Perlman's always gorgeous playing. This record is also exquisitely engineered and the balance between the Pops and Perlman is perfect. You want this recording.
0	Star Trek: Gateways Book One - One Small Step: This is getting totally pitiful. The mini-series junk trying to span stories through all the different genres of StarTrek in my opinion belongs in the trash. Pocket Books is making a big mistake. I for one only care for the original cast books. I buy one to read (which I've read them all) and I get no ending unless I go read Next Generation and then the next genre and the next and the one after that.YUCK!!
1	Life is just an edless waltz: Endless waltz is an awsome movie. the special edition DVD includes the OVA episiodes of the movie, it also includes a mobel suit encyclopedia and is veiwable in mutiple languages. It has the same voices as in the show(english version anyways). If you saw this on the cartoon network or YTV(people in canada), then you might have thought that it was very heavly edited, the truth is that it wasn't. sure commercials but thats about it. BUT, if you only saw it once, than you probobly didn't catch it all at once. Its a great DVD packed with loads of stuff that will make this a great movie from begining to end.
0	GRAND: I watched the movie on Cartoon Network about two years ago. It's an excellent movie, I tell you. It's facinating!!! ^_^I loved the characters and their personalities. I seriously loved the art designs animation. It brings out the true life of the movie. In my opinion, this DVD is great! You should get this DVD and soon. It ROCKS! ^_^!
1	You Get What You Pay For: This is not a bad product, at all. As with most camping equipment, a lower price means lower quality. If you purchase this item knowing this, then you won't be disappointed. The grill is not all that tall, so you have to let the fire burn down to coals before putting this over it. We used it mostly to hold up a small propane stove to allow for better air circulation underneath, and it worked spectacularly for that!
1	Eternal Truth: These reflective,honest and wholly recitable poems are an endless delight.Who can argue with their truths?Maybe the (...) moral prig who will be a millennia dead and forgotten while the eternal Omar shines a light of realness and honesty in a world full of flowers and forests loving nitwit poets and poeple (...) who insist that life only be seen through the view of his religion.Go read the nonsensical,idiotic,mystical blather of Rumi if you want your poets "spiritual".If you have taste, read Khayyam. Grade:A+
0	Torture: When Marvin Mange is involved in a fatal car accident, he is brought back to life as half man half animal. With his newly formed animal features, we are expected to laugh at the gags that happen as a result. But all these gags do is attempt to make the viewer less intelligent. This film heavily relies on toilet humour and it's target audience seems to be aimed at younger kids. Are adults really expected to laugh at this low class humour? If we do, we should be ashamed of ourselves!Utter tripe.
1	The Animal (Uncut Special Edition): rob's funny and it can sometimes not be funny but over all it's a great laugh.
1	Schneider does it again!: If you've seen Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo and liked Rob Schneider's performance (no pun intended) as much as I did - then you'll love The Animal! Same kind of goofy humor. Will definitely be buying this on DVD when it's released.
1	Listen to it again: When I first heard this album, I was thinking...um, no. But I listened to it a few times more (being a fan) and discovered its greatness. Now, not every track is great, but those that are make up for the others. I found it has a really great retro-80's sound that I hear others trying to produce, but didn't hit the mark like this one did.
1	In My Opnion: J.R.R. Tolken is an amazing writer, with such enchanting lands and exciting adventures it is hard not to get wrapped up in his books and never put them down.
0	boring!!!!: most boring book ever better of reading song of ice and fire this book is all bout walkin can't believe its so good chuck away its sux
0	I only put1 star so people would read this :-): Tolkien wrote an undescrible book and it cannot be done in any way and i think , that how his son tried to finish the whole series, is bad and he shouldn't have touched it because it's J.R.R.'s not Christopher's and he should have not killed the Dark Lord [Sauron] because evil must stay in the land of Middle-Earth because thats what gave the book meaning
1	The Two Towers, The best book ever!: The two towers is an awesome book. The fellowship has now broken into three groups, and the book follows the whereabouts and events of Merry and Pippin, Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli, and Frodo and Sam. Merry and Pippin have been captured by the relentless Uruk-Hai and escape into Fangorn Forest. Frodo and Sam are hopelessly trying to fufill their quest to destroy the ring with the deceitful Gollum as their guide. Meanwhile, Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli are tracking the captured hobbits in Fangorn Forest when Gandalf returns to them. They all make for Edoras and heal the bewitched king Theoden. After retreating to the fortress of Helm's Deep, Aragorn leads the battle to make a final stand...This is a fantastic book that i recommend to readers ages14 and up. There is a lot going on a one time that might be hard for younger kids to understand. I had to read the series over again to make sure i understood.
1	The Heart of ot All: We return to Middle- Earth in <u>Return of the King<u/>, the last book in <u>The Lord of The Rings<u/> trilogy. With the Fellowship already broken and parted, Frodo and Sam struggle deep in the heart of Mordor to the fires of Mount Doom. Sam begins to lose heart as Frodo falls deeper and deeper into the power of the One Ring. Aragorn comes to fully understand that as Isildur's air, he must take up the throne in Gondor. All throughout this journey, Sauron, the enemy of the people of Middle- Earth, feels his need for the One Ring growing. He will do anything to get it back, even kill the Ring- bearer.J.R.R Tolkien has created a masterpiece! You can feel the emotion and action of every event in this thriller. If you've read <u>The Fellowship of the Ring<u/> and <u>The Two Towers<u/>, I strongly advise you tie up the trilogy with this incredible journey. This book is very inspiring.
1	Wonderful Storytelling. Worthy Tolkien Novel.: In the Second Volume of the Lord of the Rings Trilogy, the story of Gimli, Legolas, Sam, and Frodo's sojourn to destroy the One Ring of Power continues. Wonderful character contrast between the flighty and angelic Elven creature Legolas, and his stout hearted dwarven companion Gimli. Engrossing universe of magic and lore that is worthy of Tolkien's talents.
1	Ella and Louis: Now this one is a no-brainer:EVERYBODY knows by now how great idea was teaming Ella (at her peak) and Louis (close enough to his peak) on this album,with a killer back-up group lead by Oscar Peterson at his rhythmiest (yes, I know it's not a real word). I'm writing about the original CD from the early 2000s I bought, not about SACD (where the review will apparently, also end up), so I can't talk about the technological finesse of this edition... I'm just claiming this is a beautiful jazz album, happily matched only byElla and Louis Again, another masterpiece. Groveling expressiveness of Louis' voice is matched beautifully with the melodic brilliance of Ella's jubilant voice and the rest is history.
1	not so bad: although i would have to say not my fav movie of all time, it's not all that bad..many folks might enjoy it and for [the price]what a steal!!! i think you see adam sandler in a different light (kinda like jim carey in the majestic....not so moranic...ps i do love little nicky). the kinda look at the camera, documentry style is cool and if you love nostalgia...not enough said 'bout the milton berle appearence....a must see
0	crummy crummy crummy: this is the worst movie i have ever seen! i turned it off it was so bad! i got it at wal-mart in like their $3 bin or something... they should have paid ME to get it!
0	Ouch This Movie Hurts: I had to write this review to counterbalance all the faked 5 star reviews. I picked this up for a buck thinking it would be worth seeing Adam Sandler's first feature film. The only part that made it worthwhile was seeing the happy Madison guys so young. Sandler does a decent job and you can see how his career got launched. Outside of that this movie is a train wreck. The plot is a waste of time. The acting is over the top and hammy. On of the most egregious parts is the sound. The only way people might like this is in its so bad its a cult classic thing. Beware the casual movie goer won't be swayed by girls in bikinis.
0	I wish no stars were an option: I believe catching every disease on earth at once would be more pleasant than watching this movie. It's not even worth a penny, which is probably how much they spent making this film. Save yourself time, money, sanity and I.Q. points RUN AWAY!
0	I had no other choice but to read this book.: This is the only book that I had to read on my flight to Florida. I was trapped! I did not like or sympathize with any of the characters. Wait, yes I did, the dog. He was the only one who was real. Self centered garbage.
1	good movie.: My daughter was doing a report on Christa McAuliffe. We rented this after she had done her report. She enjoyed actually seeing how the space program worked.
1	END OF ONE SERIES AND ACTUAL START OF ANOTHER: Enjoyed this one as much as the others in the series. This ends the Belgariad series and sets up for the Malloreon. All in all these are good reads. Most of the folks I know have read this series and The Malloreon several times...they are sort of habit forming. If read for what they were written for, light books which should be enjoyed and ones to have fun with, then you will like them. If on the other hand if you just graduated from Jr. High and are much, much too mature for them, then you should probably wait until you reach your dotage so that you can appreciate them again. Yes, they are flawed and yes there are endless contradictions (some 233 by my last count), but that is part of the charm of this work. Hey, go out to a oak tree in the woods or in your park, kick back, read and enjoy. Recommend highly.
0	Don't waste your time or money: I got this book as a gift and still think it was a waste of money. Every dream I have looked up so far was negative, most dealing w/ some future pending event, ie if you dream 'X' you are soon to lose your job or some other misfortune. How a dream relates to some future event in the physical world I'll never know. I was hoping it would deal more w/ what's going on in my subconscious, but that doesn't seem to be what this book is about.
0	Not a good Kindle edition: Unfortunately, this Kindle version is missing almost all of the illustrations, which are an integral part of the book. And the poetry is not formatted correctly and is in red on my iPad Kindle.Through the Looking Glass [Kindle Edition] by BLTC is the one you want.
1	Alice's BIG Adventures in Wonderland: I should have looked at the size of this book in making the selection. Although this book is beautiful, lovely dust jacket, interesting illustrations, it is almost too big to casually read and is more of a coffee table book. It was bought as a companion to a collectable given as a Christmas present. The entire gift was precious though and the book really made it special.
0	Only Two Stars for the Penguin Edition: It's a fantastic book, of course, and it certainly doesn't need me to praise it as millions have done before. It's probably one of the most unique things ever written: the only book that could be considered both completely a children's story and completely a book for adults. The only problem with the Penguin edition is that it's grossly over-annotated. For scholars this may be very helpful, but sadly enough a lot of the notes are either irrelevant to non-professors or provide critical instead of historical or biographical commentary which, in my opinion, ruins the greatest delight of the book: AAIW/TLG are highly interpretable and symbolic stories, but unfortunately the commentator is always interrupting like a nagging pedant before the reader has a chance to reflect. Once again, both stories well deserve their status as true English classics but another edition might be a better choice.
0	In the Rabbit Hole: This is not a pretty edition. For a serviceable edition just to read the wonderful words of these stories and to have them together, it's ok. The printing is dense and the quality of the paper is poor. The price is great. Not for a gift. Teresa
0	get a magnifying glass: I was super sad when this book arrived :( The print was sooooo small that no one wanted to read it. When purchasing the book on Amazon there was no "preview" of the pages or inside of the book. I guess that I learned my lesson. I ended up purchasing a different Alice's Adventures In Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass book so that we could read a book that had larger print. I was not happy with this book, and would not recommend it to anyone if you enjoy "normal" size print. This was really tiny!!!!!The book arrived in good shape and the shipping was satisfactory.
1	Not Just a Beloved Children's Book!: This book is a delight to both young and old, and as many times as I've read it or had it read to me, I still love the story. For one thing the characters are unforgettable. Who can forget the Queen of Hearts, Tweedledum and Tweedledee and the Mad Hatter? There are so many adaptations of this book and so many varied ways to enjoy it, that there is perhaps a danger that it may be overused. I think though that it is best enjoyed read in a book since that is where the imagination can take over and make the book something magical. Take the time to reread this great classic. It's well worth it.
0	Where is the Looking Glass?: I purchased this book because I was specifically lo0king for the sequel, Through the Looking-Glass. I already have "Alice", and for free. This edition claims Looking Glass in its title, but only includes Alice. Do not be fooled. Get Alice for free and skip this misleading version.
1	alice in wonderland: this classic story is totally worth the read. if you love fantasy this is the book to read!
0	Too little technique too much speculation and opinion: With phrases like "Because extreme physical regimens like bodybuilding are so unhealthy, a completely new medical specialty - sports medicine - has been developed in recent years," Griner dishes many opinions in the form of medical fact. His cause and effects are often speculative or down right incorrect. Sure, his technique works, but he writes about too many topics in which he has not been schooled.
1	Very Excellent: This game is a must if you like first person 3d shooter. Quake provides a wide variety of game play. The multiplayer aspect of the game makes it worth playing over and over. There are many mods (modifacations) that you can add on for extra and different game play. Team Fortress, which is by far the most popular mod, is the most fantastic multiplayer game out there that I've played. Also for those of you who are nerds, Quake II multiplayer actually shrinks the players and makes you think that the levels are actually bigger. :)
0	not the first choice: Getz other Bossa Nova album's are classics. Start with the delightful "Getz/Gilberto", the second best selling Jazz CD of all time, then "Jazz Samba", "Jazz Samba Encore". But by the time Norm Grantz at Verve pushed him into this, he was pretty tired of Samba."Chenga de Saudade" is definitely the best and "Niote Triste" is pleasant but this type of big band highly-scripted format wasn't his forte. It's Stan, so he's (almost) never bad, he puts on a brave face and does the best under the circumstances.Inoffensive, but quite Pop and shallow.Make sure you have the other albums above before you get this one.Sorry they can't all be great. Tryin' to save you money.
1	Great read!: This was my first Stuart Woods book. It has a great pace, keeps you interested and gets you involved with characters. I definitely recommend it.
1	Stan and Ollie in the Trenches: Fully restored to its original 68-minute length, Laurel and Hardy's second starring feature holds up surprisingly well. "Pack Up Your Troubles" (1932) remains among the team's most enjoyable efforts, with several classic routines and an excellent supporting cast. Stan and Ollie are a pleasure to watch in this offbeat World War I comedy-drama. Look for a cameo by director George Marshall as the vengeful cook.
0	One of the worst movies I have ever seen: Definitely in the bottom five. The screen play strains to include the well-known historical points of its subject into the film in the most ham-fisted and contrived ways in an attempt to build a feature film length linear story. It fails heroically. The skeleton story is padded out with fabricated hokum, Hollywood star turns by Warren Beatty in possibly his most annoying performance ever, and gratuitous violence galore. If ever there was a must-miss it's this pile of garbage.
0	A let down: The Simple Minds (a brass band in african chimes) and Mansun (wide open space) tracks are super, as are, of course, the two Chicane tracks (which can be found on Far From The Maddening Crowds). Otherwise, I'm really hard pressed to recommend any other tracks. Not recommended.
0	Slow and amateurish: Poorly done and as stated quite amateurish. It simply did not get moving and finally turned it off. If it got any better I'd be surprised.
0	boring: Movie was very boring, not what i expected. The movie does not have much to offer. Overall I would not recommend this movie.
1	A "Must Have" for college dorm rooms: We have 4 kids and got our first Hot Shot when they all lived at home. We love it and use it almost everyday. It became the "must have" for college item as each of them went off to college over the last 7 years. We just bought the last one for our youngest who is going to college this fall. We've also bought them for graduation gifts for friends and general family gifts - they are greatly appreciated and used. Wish Amazon would buy these in bulk and make them available for free shipping ; )
0	This guide sucks: After ascertaining that this was the best market guide for me to purchase in order to get my novel published I gladly ordered it. Well, they don't include a great deal of reputable literary agents (who are constantly in the trades). Example: Trident Media, ICM, William Morris-even Gloria Loomis (Walter Mosley's agent---and he wrote an intro article "Connecting with the rest of the world through words" on page 6 (!!!). In addition they don't even list major Science-Fiction awards, the Hugo and Nebula-what else are they missing. I feel robbed. Then to make matters worse, I went to their website to complain (filled out their form) and got a bounce back that said, "This is an automatically generated Delivery Status Notification. Delivery to the following recipients failed. anneb@fwpubs.com"LAME!!!
0	piece of garbage: I bought mine almost1 year ago, trying to improve my old (but good) Dell Axim X5, and after using the warranty 4 times, (because the one I bought was overheating when it was Off) first they replaced the battery, then the equipment (twice) and the IPaQs continue overheating, with no technical explanation from HP. Now they offered me an "Improvement" to my original choice (the IPaQ 210) but these guys are so smart that sent me only the new IPaQ (210) with no battery, cables, Installation CD, stylus, etc. (the 2795 and the 210 are quite differents in the accessories) this was almost1 month ago and they are still playing games with me. Conclusion: after1 year of purchasing the IPaQ I could use it properly around1 month. My worst experience as Client.... I will go back to DELL.
1	Had to send it back!: I really like the product, its way smaller that I thought, 2 reason i had to send it back,1. dead pixel, 2. had to reset 3 times in one hour. i dont know wat the heck is wrong with it. it doesnt support kingstore secure digital card, (4gb), otherwise the lcd is cristal clear, has wifi internet which is preety amazing, fast, i didnt get to see everything yet cuz i shiped it back the same day i got it, hope the one i am getting now comes with no diffects.
1	Good: Three CD set of piano music.Long,austere improvisations remindingrenaissance organ playing.The Second Part is especially fine.Recommended!
0	Quality could be better: It was dark and cloudy at times. Not the greatest buy. I am very disappointed. Can I return for a refund?
1	Best Music Video Ever!!!: This is a video that you will want to watch over & over & over - and love every time. Absolutely the best music video ever made.
0	wasted money: I am restricted to a wheelchair, and so must rely on grabbers,to assist me when reaching for things in higher areas or across wide spacess. I already had one of the ergonomically18' grabbers in this style and really liked the light wt. and dexterity it allowed me, over many of the other styles. So, I was very disappointd when after the THIRD time I used it, I heard a click and part of the internal workings actually came through the handle, Now, it just takes up space while I try to see if I can get my money back. Needless to say, I am aggeivated and dissapointd. DONT BUY THIS PRODUCT.
1	Desert Island Essential: I have made a gift of this album to a number of my friends. If I had to pick only10 pieces of music ever, this would be my first choice. Timeless, elegant, soulful, spiritual, dark, sad, silent!
0	IT HAS NOTHING TO DO ABOUT SPYING: This is not an espionage thriller as the cover and title of this book would have you beleive. The vast majority of the content in this book is about how two people working in the CIA fall in love with each other and how they are so excited being around one another. I for one, and i think most people would agree, think that someone who would buy this book would be interested in the CIA and the history of the cold war. This book has nearly nothing to do with either of those subjects! Their are some good parts to this book but they are overshadowed by a love story. This book would be better catogorized as a romance novel!
0	Poorly written love story, good spy story: This book needed an editor. I felt as if the authors were trying to increase their page count by putting in way too many descriptors about things that didn't need describing.The love story is ridiculous. It is forced into the narrative like a square peg in a round hole. I skipped all the things about "our eyes met, and I felt myself blush" etc. Come on Jonna, you are a master of disguise and you can't disguise the fact that you slept with your boss the night before?The spy story is interesting, although lacking some details understandably to protect on-going missions.A beach read.
0	Poorly Written with Virtually No Story Line to Follow: WOW....I never thought a publishing house would allow a book to be published without having an editor read it first. The authors desperately needed to employ a ghostwriter for assistance.The story line is almost impossible to follow, the personal references to their "love story" are dull and self-serving and they left out significant and I might add, much required details of operations, planning and ending results all that made this book a real time (and money) waster.The storyline, billed as a look behind secret spy techniques and operations, has in reality, little to do about spying, operations, the Cold War or the CIA. You can learn more from a bad James Bond movie. The other review recommending it be classified as a romance novel is correct. This book seems to have been written as a personal memoir not for mass consumption.
1	Hilariously slanted look at history: This movie is great! Highly entertaining, especially for those of us who even know what Watergate was. Though young at the time, this movie brought the times back in a hilarious fashion. I'm suprised at how many kids in school today have never even heard of Watergate. Maybe this funny look at a twisted history will cause them to look back. Oh yeah, great soundtrack. Peace man!
0	Whatever you do don't waste your money on this movie: Me and my friends rented this movie even though we'd never heard of it. All I have to say is it was the biggest waste of money I've ever spent. This movie was terrible. I'm a fan of Michelle Williams in Dawson's Creek but she destroyed any credibility that she had by starring in this movie. The movie was supposed to be a comedy, but there was nothing funny about it. We were so bored that we didn't even finish it. We had to turn it off it was too terrible to finish. Whatever you do don't put yourself through the torture of having to see this movie.
1	Keeps you laughing: Well you don't have to be a history buff to get the gags in this movie. Both lead actresses have that ditzy, aloof girl next door routine done pat and this along with the situations they accidently find themselves in makes for one heck of a re-watchable movie. I usually love DVD's that have enough content to last10 or more viewings and this definately one of them. There are plenty of jokes or play on the word ' Dick ' in this movie and that alone is good enough to last for multiple viewings. I'm not a history buff, but you don't have to be to get how ' Walnut Leaves ' could have re-written the history books...There's to much to this movie to explain, just buy its money well spent.
0	Love Ella; didn't love this CD: This was a very jazzy album and just seemed to try too hard. I know singers must get tired of singing the same type of songs, but I didn't enjoy this one at all and gave it away. Didn't even want to keep it for my Christmas collection.
1	Something's happening here....: A haunting, mysterious and magical movie. Marjorie Cameron adds an element of real life magic. Kenneth Anger also had done this when he used her in `The Inauguration of the Pleasure Dome (1954)'. Marjorie Easton also adds to the spell, and Dennis Hopper is wonderful. The carnival is the perfect background for a a plot about fantasy and reality. Filmed at the Santa Monica Pier, Venice and Ocean Park, California, where Anton LaVey played organ at strip joints in the late1940's. The name Mora is found in many parts of the world as the death aspect of the `Triple Goddess', or Night Mare, or female vampire.
0	Good as paper weight: Never been able to sync with computer, battery consistently deteriorated and now,12 months after I bought it and despite the minimal use (as it does not connect with PC its use is very limited), battery has now completely died and can only use it when connected to AC.HP assistance is useless - suggested to assist me purchase a new one - right, not in a million years.Not impressed by product or by HP. Had a Dell before which worked flawlessly for years. Decided to 'upgrade' to HP. I wish Dell were still making their Pocket PCs to replace this useless and expensive device.
0	does not live up to promise: A cute book, but contains very little information for all of its promise. The authors are busy making jokes but not talking about the nitty gritty of restoration. Maybe it is to hard to do since every job presents its own challanges. I just found the content thin. I am sorry I purchased it. If I could have found a copy in my local library, I would have saved some money.
0	More motivational than substantive: Although the book covers quite a bit in its 250-some pages, it lacks serious substance. While it motivates those in the administrative field to take charge and harbor an invincible positive attitude, it offers little direction or guidance beyond that. Noted in the Acknowledgements that the book was a 35-year work in progress, it shows. Many sections seem brief or entirely cut off with no direction or conclusion and the book flits through sections with no clear path. There's a lot of build up and no real answers to the questions that plague those in this profession. The entire book left me wanting to know more, but not giving me a whole lot I didn't already know.
0	RCBS130: I have not used it yet. I tried to balance the scale to zero, but I can't seem to keep it zeroed. The unit is mainly plastic and very light weight. At this point, I'm not impressed.
0	Worst movie ever: The acting and the script for this aAlfred Hitchcock movie are horrible. Save your money and order one of his later movies.
0	The 39 Steps: The VHS tape was inpossible to watch. I tried it on 2 different playback machines that were in perfect working condition and played other tapes just to see if the problem was in the machine or the tapes. I found that the problem was only with the 39 Steps, the tape I had just purchased.The speed of the tape was intermittant, that is is started out running too fast, changed back to a normal speed and then would speed up again. It was not possible to adjust the tracking ( on either of the two players I tried). I had hoped to send the tape as a present to a friend who is interested in old Alfred Hitchcock movies, but had to junk it instead. I ended up purchasing another version of the movies in DVD format from Amazon ( that was was perfect) to send to my friend.This was the first item that I have purchased through Amazon with which I was not pleased.The 39 Steps [VHS]
0	BE CAREFUL - ONLY BUY CRITERION EDITION: If you don't get the Criterion Edition, you will be getting an inferior transfer of this film: fuzzy images, fuzzier sound...yuck! The "bad" transfers include the one that Tony Curtis introduces.Again, look for the Criterion Edition.
0	Deep: This is a very hard read, very deep and one must truly truly be alone on an island to read this book
0	Ugggg...: I'm all for reading soul-searching materials, but this book was like pulling teeth - I felt it was translated (and poorly at that) so the sentence structure was long and difficult to follow; NOT that word choice was difficult or that it was above reading comprehension, far from it...some of the sentences just didn't make sense and I often lost their entire meaning.
1	The Power in Metaphors: Estes has provided a great service to us all by preserving and interpreting these archetypal stories that pass on the wisdom of the generations that precede us with regard to living, loving, rites of passage, and dying. Second only to Joseph Campbell's work (The Power of Myth) in it's power to explain many of the facets of our lives. As equally valuable to men as to women.
1	Beloved: I read the book first, but then listened to the audio, (a gift from a boyfriend that new how much I LOVED Women Who Run With the Wolves), and was delighted to discover not only Dr. Clarissa Pinkola-Estes youthful, pretty, and encouraging voice, but also new stories and commentary that were not in the book! For those who have not discovered Dr. Clarissa Pinkola-Estes and her vast collection of audio, I wonder if they will feel the connection to their souls as I instantly feel a connection to my soul each time I read her words and hear her voice. A priceless gift to oneself, a priceless gift for a loved one.
0	Prysock vs. Harvey: I ended up here because I was trying to see if Laurence Harvey's version of This Is My Beloved is available on CD. Alas, it does not appear to be. I am one of the lucky ones who ran across another vinyl of it a few years ago many years after losing my first copy and am listening to it as I write. As much as I love Arthur Prysock's voice, no one can TOUCH Harvey's version of this book and I have both! I would suggest checking stores that specialize is used/out of print albums for Harvey's version. No disrespect to Prysock, but you'll never listen to it the same way again!
1	great for what i do: This toy is great for customization as well as overall playing... I'm actually going to get another one just so I can customize an Ice cream van out of it... I recommend getting this if you customize toys... or as a gift for your kids
1	Standard Breakfast: I have been eating Erin's for Breakfast for over 2 yrs now. Very filling, taste is excellent. Good to take along when you're late for work as I usually am. A great all around breakfast. I like mine warmed up in the Microwave.
1	Good Stuff: It was because of the other graphic novel based in Arkham Asylum that I heard of this one. Sure enough, they are different. "Arkham Asylum: Living Hell" is definitely a most enjoyable book. The text is good, the drawing style is nice, and if you're Batman baddies, you'll find plenty.You'll see very little of Batman in there. The story is entirely based in Arkham and focuses on a new inmate in there, and various subplots involving other inmates, the classical Batman villains.I can't compare with other books based on Batman, because I only read one, but I sure can say this book is an enjoyable read.
1	Almost perfect Batman book: From the start I was enthralled. The art, the story, the atmosphere all had me captivated. I really enjoyed the drama tone Living Hell had. It didn't start out with a sense of action/adventure but more of a serious prison drama. It definitely had action especially towards the end but for the most part it was a drama about one guy who got stuck in Arkham Asylum.Other reviewers were also disappointed with the way the book turned out in the last chapter and I have to agree with them. It wasn't what I was expecting and all the while I was reading it I was kind of discouraged. But once I got to the last few pages I was like, "This totally rocks!". In my opinion it made up for all the "weirdness" that was in the last chapter.Overall It wasn't as psychological as Arkham Asylum: Serious House on Serious Earth but it gave a good feel for what life is like at Arkham Asylum.
0	should have gone with another flavor: DId not like the chocolate oatmeal raisin. wasnt very tasty. It is filling and wholesome but I would not buy again at this price.
0	Not worth watching--nothing Keaton put out really is and maybe never was: Like so many of Keaton's films it is more fun to wish you could watch them than it is to actually tune in.This film has one novelty only--the ship looks expensive. Beyond thet its as worthless as Keaton's cheap short films (of which there are two on this DVD). The films all usually have very little intelligence in scripts (though Battling Butler was almost a smart Keaton movie). The sets look like they cost about 50 bucks to make (on the shorts and almost every last one of his long films ---this movie only looks grand mostly because of the passenger ship--the sub at the end looks like a $10 prop set). Why did anybody think so many would want to warm up to this loser of an actor called Buster?
1	it works: what more do you need to know. Only 4 Stars because the unit responds a bit slowly to the remote control, but I don't think that's because it has been chipped; it's a design fault from Toshiba. Unit plays all region dvds with no fussing around. and the price is right.
1	Three women reflect on sandplay: If you've wondered what sandplay was all about from a Kalffian/Jungian perspective, these three women have a lot of wisdom to impart. Beyond "beginning sandplay" texts which provide a basic introduction to sandplay, this volume explores the essentials of sandplay while also going into depth about salient topics such as silence, the numinous, Self, and chaos. Based on conversations between these three elders of sandplay, similiarities and differences have been teased out to create a rich tapesty of the potential growth and healing inherent in sandplay. I highly recommend this book.
0	Good product bad deal: this is being sold for 5-8 dollars on most of the internet. word to the wise, buy this somewhere else.
0	Didnt work for me: I used the pest control product for cloth moths. I placed several of these around my house,1 in each closet, ect., but none of the 8 traps have caught any moths yet. Its been several weeks since I put these out in my house. I would recommend trying just one box, and see how that works for you. I unfortunately ordered several boxes at once hoping it would help, but so far, these havent caught any moths yet, but every coule days I see one or two still flying around the house.
0	DOES NOT WORK, DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY: This products is terrible and ineffective. We placed several around our home and only caught1-2 moths in each. Get the pantry moth trap in the red and yellow pack. It is wonderful. Moths multiply so quickly that you need a powerful attracting mechanism to get rid of them.
1	Safer pantry pest trap: After buying these traps in a local hardware store, I found them online at a reduced rate. They worked very well initially and did help to stop the cycle with the Pheromone attraction. But the pheromone seems to wear out in ten days. not weeks. However, that said, these simple easy traps took my home out of being moth infested, to having a few here and there. I recommend them highly.
0	Safer moth traps no longer work: I had been using Pantry Pest traps successfully for years. Recent purchases haven't worked at all! I will not buy them again.
0	Safer Pantry Pest Trap: I was unimpressed by this product. When I put this product out on my counter, the moths looked a little dazed and confused. Most flew near the trap, but less than10 percent got inside the trap, near the sticky part. The rest just kept flying around the kitchen. I also tried placing the trap inside the cabinet (with everything removed) with similar results. I would find moths within inches of the trap, but none inside.
1	Works but don't depend on it to rid the moths: We bought it to get rid our house of the Indian Meal Moth. These insects are pretty harmless but annoying and would turn up in flour/cereals etc. After setting up the trap, nothing happened for like 2-3 days and we would manually swat the moths. Later it managed to catch15-20 of these. But it would not attract all of them. We still had to go after them with brooms etc.
0	Did not do the job: The Pantry Pest did not work. The sticky adhesive missed most of the moths!! I actually trapped a moth in the triangle and it hit the sides of the trap--nothing! It bounced off them like it was super moth!! The lure is tiny and did not attract many moths. I would try other things first before buying this.
0	This product does not seem to be working!: I picked this product up at my local Ace Hardware store. I had high hopes for these traps, but they simply aren't working. The lure seems to work, but I haven't found one moth in either trap and they have been in place for three days now. The moths do fly around the traps and walk inside only to come right back out. I don't know if there is a problem with the glue or not (I didn't want to test it by touching it and compromising the product), but I do see tiny flecks of something on the glue pads. It's very frustrating to be out the money for these traps since they don't seem to be working. It's even more frustrating to see the moths still flying around.
1	Pantry moths and larvae: Found product to be effective. However, it will take at least three weeks to start seeing results.We had a moderate infestation.
1	So far, so good... but found elsewhere for less $$$!: Put it in my pantry tonight, and it caught 2 moths within15 minutes, so something is working!That being said, I actually bought this at Home Depot for only $5.78+tax! This really casts doubt on Amazon's claim that the list price is $11.11 ...
0	A dancer: Based on the reviews that were available last year, I bought this DVD, but I'm disappointed. I was expecting it to "dancier" than it is, and something about the production quality bothers me.
1	Nina the Torch Chanteuse--Highly Recommended: Nina's voice is like no other vocalist--the emotional intensity she brings to her covers and originals are non-pareleil. This "After Hours" CD (formerly on Philips, now Verve) is probably the best one that shows Nina in a "torch-chanteuse" mode. It is my co-favorite alongside the Jazz Masters on Verve. Nina's voice was at a creative peak. Each song stands out from the next. One could play this CD1,000 times and never get tired. Each time the listener discovers new depth and meaning in Nina's singing. I prefer Nina during this mid-60's period to her later stint at RCA when she became too blues-oriented and political.
0	If only I could vote "0 Stars": I am continually disappointed in Boy George. He has such potential, yet puts out what is in my opinion, pure crap. The songs on this album are dreadful. The lyrics are embarassingly poor and the music is the same bad glam rock as his last full album (which should have been scrapped with the out takes this album consists of). Boy George has done some brilliant vocals when put in the hands of producers like Faithless and the Pet Shop Boys, and his latest singles "When Will You Learn", and "Love Is Leaving". I was hoping he would release an album in that vein. In my opinion, Boy George should stick with electronics and dance music, and leave the the guitars in his garage.
0	I don't know anyone in this book!: Ok, having now finished the book, I am still giving it two stars. I still didn't know any of the characters in this book, but it leaves off with a major cliffhanger. The descriptions in this book are many and varied, the technical stuff is very technical and the descriptions about the people and their culture is very skimpy, especially about the Blood. I would've like to known more about this culture and what makes it tick, and why the Federation is out there in this area.Thanks for reading!~Pandora
1	mexican way: Well, this is in my opinion the best period of Mahalia's carrer (1955). Her voice is still strong and too expressive. The songs let her "touch" us in a special way. It's a good oportunity for young people to listen the background's soul singers.
0	Not DTS, Not even a good picture: I have learned a big lesson through the purchase of this video, some groups will show their fans respect and give them DTS with high quality video. Not the case here. This is simply a VHS version recorded to DVD. Not to brag but I could have done this in my basement and produced better quality. If you do not believe me, purchase this DVD then purchase the The Eagles - Hell Freezes Over. I guarantee you will want you money back.
0	could have been better: THIS IS ...GOOD FOR FANS WHO LIKE THE POPULAR STUFF, BUT DIE HARD FANS THE ONLY VIDEOS THAT ARE EXCITING ARE HUMANS BEINGS AND THE LIVE DREAMS, NOTHING ELSE IS RARE , THAT YOU HAVENT RECORDED A1000'S TIMES OFF MTV. THERS A LOT MISSING INCLUDING THE BLUE ANGELS DREAMS VIDEO AND QUITE A FEW OTHERS (NOTABLY111). GEEZ THEY COULD OF PUT ON SOME OLD LIVE VH STUFF, TO BE INTERESTING OR HAVE SOME INTERVIEWS.TIMES LIKE THESE I WISH I WAS A KISS OR BONJOVI FAN , THEY GET MULTIPLE VIDEOS WITH EACH ALBUMS, AND SEEM TO PUT SOME EFFORT INTO THEM .SINCE DAVE LEFT THE ENTERTAINMENT HAS DIED.
1	Please, let get it right.: First, this is a great DVD collection of some truly amazing Van Halen stuff. It's only an hour long, but the collection is a very well thought out and executed program, chronologically tracing their musical career, and spanning through all three lead vocalists: David Lee Roth, Sammy Hagar, and Gary Cherone.But I've got a bone to pick with other reviewers - come on, there's got to be some people out there that know what they're talking about. Everyone needs to stop abusing Gary Cherone. He is a truly talented singer, well worthy of the company he keeps. Van Halen III bombed for a lot of reasons, but as we all know, it's easiest to blame the lead vocalist - look at your own band. These people need to listen to Pornograffitti. Then I'll take their Cherone opinion with more interest. I mean look at the shoes he had to fill. I'm truly glad that he didn't try to sound like Hagar and Roth, and sounded like Cherone. That in itself commands a lot of respect.
1	I blurted out laughing so many times!! Mama Ruby is Madea: The narrator did such a fantastic job with bringing all the characters to life. The book is off the hook! Terrifying and funny at the same time. The story is crazy and makes me think about history. I sure hope people didn't live like this for real but I am sure they did. Mama Ruby thinks that satan is a low down, black, funky dog who has the strength of10 bulls! This is the real life Tyler Perry's Madea.
1	Pam's Opinion on The Upper Room: I just got finished reading The Upper Room by Mary Monroe and I have to say that I really enjoyed it. I was looking throughout the bookstore one day and stumbled upon it. It really wasn't my1st pick but I decided to give it a shot after reading God Don't Like Ugly and God Still Don't Like Ugly. I must say that the book really surprised me. When I first started reading the book I really wasn't that into it and would only pick it up when I was bored but by the end of the book I didn't want to put it down. I really like her style of writing and the book was really superb to me. I would recommend it to a friend.
1	**** EXCELLENT PAGE TURNER******: This book was so captivating!!! It kept my attention right from the start. I could not put the book down! I stayed up late at night and had to force myself to put it down, I wanted to finish it in one sitting it was so good. You really feel the pain for the main character Annette, how she was abused and ostracized by her classmates,her being protective of her mother, and her relationship with Rhoda her best friend. The author really knows how to tell a story, I highly recommend this book!!! I can't wait for Mary Monroe to write some more novels. I thoroughly enjoyed this book ...you will too!!!
0	Returned. Way too specific for my needs.: I'm a coach for an after school girls group that trains for a 5K at the end of a12 week program. I'm a school counselor, NOT a trained coach or PE teacher. I wanted some general advice about helping my elementary girls prepare for the 5K, hydration needs, Pre race meals, etc. This was waaaaaay too specific for me and not helpful in my case.
0	Smiley, Cheer Up!: Not to worry, President Bush will be re-elected in November and, I'm sure, will continue to tickle you pink with grammatical goofs. Afganistan and Irag are progressing toward democracy and you'll still be able to cash your government entitlements. Saddam Hussein has been captured but you personally are free to bash christians in our country. The U.S. will continue to be the greatest nation on the face of the earth but you'll continue to be free to advocate its takeover by the U.N. All of this should make you happy!
1	maximum WHO: In my opinion, "The Kids are Alright" it the best rock documentary ever. And that's because as originally presented, the material it covers and the way it handles the material is expert, right on the button, smoothly flowing, exciting, and informative, explosive stuff.But then, what happens? Well, if your music/rock-music appreciation is worth its salt at all, you want more, and in the case of the WHO, much, much more. And that's exactly what you get in this package: 2 discs chock-full of information and anecdotes you've always wanted or never (too bad, you're getting it) wanted to know...ah well, I guess that's not exactly true - I mean, if you're a far gone full-goosed Who fanatic, perhaps you'd like to hear about each and every single sordid detail of Pete's, Roger's, John's, and Moonie's exploits. Nevertheless, for the price of admission, this little package is powerfully packed...somewhat you might say, like a certain quartet from Shepherds Bush.
1	Bag It, a wake up call on plastics: Jeb Barrier is a likeable, interested guy who presents a serious subject in an enjoyable way. This is a well done examination of our plastic bag use, some attempts to curtail it and reasons why we must.
1	BRAVO! CHER!: This is one DVD you'll want to watch over and over again.As a child I grew up listening to Sonny & CHER.The songs from the 60's brought back memories,including the Sonny & Cher clips from the tv show.Cher is a true DIVA, and represents what a real DIVA is. This lady can put a show on from beginning to end!
1	We don't have Cher in Brazil: In fact, I want to buy this DVD because it isn't avaliable in Brazil, but my equipment is able just for discs from 4th region. If you have a disc with this configuration send me a e-mail. Thanks claudia
1	That's just how it is: I had a lot of fun seeing myself in many cartoons, I was laughing and crying at the same time.
0	Cheap, unreliable.: Radius Technology DVDs ID as "OPTODISC" brand media. (That is, OPTODISC makes the discs for Radius). OPTODISC media are generally found to be lousy: poor compatibility with many burners and many "coaster" (unreadable) burns. Amazon has high quality RIDATA blanks for a little more money. I highly recommend you buy them instead. Save yourself a lot of headaches and (if you store anything of importance) heartbreak. There really *IS* a significant difference between very cheap DVD media (like these) and better DVD media (like the Ridata).
0	Buy it from a department store: The La Mer Concentrate is great... but it doesn't cost anywhere near this much. Even Neimans sells it for less.
0	Misleading: This particular case does not allow you to open the phone to the internal keyboard as hinted in the description. You have to take the phone out of the case to do that. The company was really nice in replying to my inquiry though. Good thing it was cheap. I bought other things from them that worked out really well.
1	Can't wait for his next book...: I'm a little late getting to read this wonderful book, published in 2001, but am oh so glad I found it on the shelves.What a delightful read, couldn't put it down. When you laugh out loud and also shed a few tears you know you found the perfect book.Good Job, Jim KoKoris...keep 'em coming.Penny BurkeMt Laurel, NJ
1	Wrong color sent: The item itself is very good; however, I ordered 3 different colors, one of which you did not send (yellow rainbow). Instead, you sent 2 Medieval Blues and one Blue Hawaii. I was disappointed not to receive the color I had specified, especially since the girl that took the order stated that all 3 colors were in stock.
1	Not too seriously: This is a great book for lover's of vocabulary. As you can infer from the title, it doesn't take itself too seriously, and pokes fun at itself. It is a virtual treasure trove of wonderful nuanced words with clearly defined meanings, explained in a non-traditional, fun, and interesting way. Recommended.
1	A great book about a great pitcher!: I have almost no earthly idea why this book is out of print. It is one of the best books I've ever read. When I was in fifth grade, out teacher was giving away very old books from her bookshelves and I was just lucky enough to get one. This book tells Bob Gibson's grips and how he threw his pitches. And his accounts of major events in his career. If you can get ahold of one, lucky you!
1	Dying to have known DVD (Gerson Therapy): The Gerson Therapy represents the courage and unselfishness of one man, Dr. Max Gerson, to help the world with their fight against all disease. The fact that this information has been suppressed, plagurized and kept from the general public by our medical community and its associations is absolutely criminal and if our government wasn't so corrupt, it would be corrected as it should've been when Dr. Gerson presented it to our Senate many, many years ago.Japan is using it and so is Europe to cure cancer and many other diseases and yet most of the people in America are still having chemotherapy presented to them as though it's the only way to cure cancer.
0	Great service but . . .: the tape was in poor condition that had streaks through some of the tape. That information should have been stated in the description.
1	Excellent analysis of Knowledge Management: Ms. Dixon does an excellent job of describing knowledge management and its role in making an organization more successful. Through the various models she builds, she makes it clear when to use which model and more important, for a technical person like myself, when to use technology and when not to use it. In these days when everything has a technological solution, it is refreshing to see a perspective that positions technology as the tool that it is. Excellent!
0	What an unpleasant surprise ...: Yes the concept of the book, a Victorian novel of a young girl married to a much older man, an unscrupulous publisher no less, led me to dish out the big bucks and buy this book ....If they said this book was steamy, it certainly was, but, the steam came from me in having to read this mush. I think they should have announced this book as ANTI VICTORIAN literature since sensuality is hinted at but never touched. Thats why I rate this book with one star since you can't have serious relationships and marriage between people that are decades appart in age without some sort of spice. The fact that the man in the book is a scumbucket is even more reason to delvelop this as a reality...Well yes theres the word .. reality .. which is what this book does not have."Experiences of a young girl growing to maturity" is what the covers says ... what it should say is that this is so boring and meant for readers that think watching grass grow is exciting!
0	Why Isn't The 2009 Anniversary Edition Widescreen Format???: The old Dvd from 2001/2003/2005 (whichever!) states its Widescreen Format(1:85.1) with a Running Time of 93 min and Rated-R.The 2009 reissue DVD says its full frame with a Running Time of 91 mins and Unrated. (???)I'm glad that this release date got pushed back until January 2010 so that maybe I'll just cancel the new reissue order that I placed, and order an older DVD print from a private collector instead!This makes absolutely NO SENSE to me!?Can someone PLEASE shed some light on this for me if I am 'mistaken'?
1	good slasher: instead of the lack of creativity that most slashers have this film is good. the style is wonderful and the charecters are real. they really got good actors for this movie. has lots of twists and you can tell where i know what you did last summer got there idea. the film had some scary parts. i would recomend this.
1	It's the greatest book about AST I've ever read !: There's everything about breed history, housing, training and making your AST healthy and happy. And I like pictures and humorous comments.
1	One of the best movies of all time: If you haven't seen CASABLANCA, you're in for a real treat. Not only is it a love story but it's a thriller set in Vichy France Casablanca with intrigue and broken hearts. And, unlike many movies that started out with good intentions, this baby delivers in all areas, even story.Some real twists and a great surprise ending. A real gem. Hold on to this one and love it.
0	Did not know it did not download to your device.: Since I am in an area that does not have good internet service I am unable to watch the movie I purchased. I thought it downloaded to the kindle for a period of time to watch at your convience. I will know in the future not to purchase any.
0	Casablanca: My disc is bad; It would not get past the 8th scene. I probably need to buy a new one --from somewhere else.
1	Great movie!: This movie is a must-see for folks of all ages! I can't believe I had never seen it before. Wonderful love story.
1	Great film, good DVD: First of all: Mister " thebadgercarlton ", Widescreen wasn't invented yet in1942!Fullscreen is the only original ratio for Casablanca.Casablanca is one of the greatest films ever and the DVD is good, but the film really needs restoration, especiallyin scene No13.
1	A movie fan's dream..film noir and romance combined.: What is striking about the movie first is its setting: The waystation between Nazi Europe and America. The characterization is excellent. Bogart and Bergman play opposite each other extremely well, and Claude Rains is absolutely fabulous. Rains is witty, well played, and his humor is well timed and dry as a bone. All around, there isn't one person who plays his/her character poorly. Even extras with one line contribute to the movie's overall greatness. See it. Overall, an excellent movie with a good story, and a GREAT ending.
0	How should I put this?: I hate this movie. Its not even a movie, more of a waste of time. I've wasting too much time writing this review already. THIS IS NOT A CLASSIC! It doesn't even qualify as bad or horrible! See CITIZEN KANE a million times (no really, a million) before you see this one. If I could just leave all the stars blank, then maybe I could begin to do it justice.
0	If you love this film, don't buy this DVD.: The Greatest American Film is destroyed by a choice of a critic who is chosen to do the commentary in this DVD set. How can they let Roger Ebert, which is considered the most stupid American critic nowadays, be a part of this masterpiece?
1	Casablanca: A marvelous movie with all the foreign intrigue you could want.A true love story wrecked by war.The movie worked very well and I feel great about this purchase.
1	I Bought this as a gift: I got this for my Father, he liked it & mentioned if the movie lasted 5 more minutes he would have had gotten cancer from all the smoking!LOL! Now that would cause a R Rating!!!!
0	fornication: same old story. immorality. fornication between rick and the chick. and what happened after this? bergomeister went and committed adultery and her children suffered for it. don't think satan has only been around since the beatles. he's been plying his trade for millennia. who paid to see it? rotten americans. they gratified their lust, and the movie made money. and the tale kept spinnin'. satan's got a real racket. bergomeister and bogey fell for his tricks and are you know where now. they were satan's pawns, just like america is. love of money, by mr. warnermeister, is the root of all evil. corrupt movie used by seducing spirits (demons) to lead the world to hell.
1	Love this movie: I had always wanted to see this movie and when I found it for the price I did I could not pass it up. It is truly one of the great character pieces I have ever seen. I would recommend this to anyone, even if you don't like romance movies this one is still worth a watch.
1	A Package of Nostalgia: What a wonderful gift! A numbered souvenir box containing "Casablanca" on 3 DVD's, 2 of which are on Blu-Ray (viewer take note) with footage of the Warner Brothers' history as trendsetters of the early history of movie making. Comes complete with a poster and a coaster to impress your friends when you host a "Casablanca" party - be sure to wear Ingrid's hat!
1	Fantastic old movie!: I rented Casablanca as I hadn't seen it in years. I downloaded it onto my Kindle Fire and watched it on a long airplane flight. It was great!
1	Hookah: The hookah is great. The delivery was fast and the company was very helpful. They called and explained the various tobaccos and helped me pick some out.
1	I Love Steve Coogan...: and this was another jewel. Many of Coogan's characters aren't that familiar to U.S. audiences so this was a trove of unexpected fun. Hope I can see him live and in person someday.
1	beyound the sea of ice: a very interesting book that follows a simular theam to Auel but is much more exciting and with less romance, which i am happy for, i never liked romance stories
1	Best Illustration book I could ever wish for..: "Creative Illustration" is an amazing book. It is extremely useful, advice given in the book is exceptional. Most things discussed and showcased in this book I have never seen in any other art books (contemporary or vintage). Unique. Unbelievably good.This book made me a better artist, and I feel like now I understand everything with so much more depth.Loomis also gives a little insight in master Pyle's methods, compositions and advice for success in the industry that is still valid today.Best investment of a hundred dollars I've ever made. A definite must have for a professional, a gem for the serious student of illustration.(Note: This book is not for beginners. It's for people who are serious about the business. If you're just starting out, just get one of those "how to draw (insert whatever) books" and come and get this book in a couple of years.)
1	Grill skillet: This is a great item to stir fry of vegetables or shrimp over the grill. I love the detachable handle which makes it easy to take the skillet off and on when using on the grill. The pan cleans up easily.
0	did not work: product did not work. wanted it to download music but it would never sync with computer it wouldn't charge the device either
1	Pretty, dainty, worth your penny, but...: The set was agreeable in appearance I felt they were exactly what I had been looking for. They came precisly as advertised I was happy for some weeks. But, just like the fire opal set I bought at the same time as these, something in my skin did not approve and I suffered itchy ears and red, scab like skin, underneath the place holder on the back. I can assume the place holders were of the same make as the stud itself, but something about the opal set and this set made my ears painful. I'll just save them and have them cleaned to give them as a gift to some one with less sensitive ears than mine.
0	Too much revenge.: Not much of a story. There is sympathy for the main character but too much repetition of the hurdles involved. At times the "revenge" theme just isn't enough of a story, and there is no more to the plot.
0	Not worth buying: If you are a thinking person, this book is not for you. I could not finish the book, it just could not draw me in. It is comparable to a daytime soap opera, and I am not a fan of soap operas.
1	Excellent Album: This is an excellent album, not only because Dee Dee is a fantastic singer, but also because she was able to provide some of the first vocal versions of many of the tunes. Nica's Dream is amazing with vocal precision most singers fall short of delivering. Lonely Woman is haunting and melodic. Overall, this is a fantastic album.
0	Not a bit of freshness to Horace Silver's masterwork!: Musical projects based on singing lyrics to jazz standards are not to my taste. Just because they usually do not add a least bit of motivation and artistry to the original instrumentals. Horace Silver is a particular victim of that situation. In other words, I do not know any vocalized effort on his extraordinary work worth listening to except Mark Murphy's "That's how I love the blues" ... All Blue Note albums by Horace Silver - the great composer, pianist and combo leader - ... I'd rather have them all. Make your choice.
0	Offset dialog screens: Story and picture quality aside, it is very annoying that the film seems to have been transferred off center. From the opening titles to the dialog boxes, anywhere from one to three letters of the printing are missing on the left side of the screen. I guess you get what you pay for.
1	Great wave board: My grandchildren asked me to order this for them to give as a surprise to their mother who, after they each recieved a wave board for Christmas, taught them how to ride them. She enjoyed riding and occassionally would monopolize their wave boards, so they decided she needed her own. SHE LOVES IT.The board is exactly as described and functions as expected and needed.
1	very fun: I bought this for my10 year old for his birthday - it was too big for him, so I then bought the smaller wave ripple (wave ripple) for him, and he convinced me to keep this one for myself. We've both had a great time learning to ride it. It took about a day to learn. I'd also recommend real protective gear - and not riding downhill. At all. Ever. (from experience)
0	fun, while it lasted....: Yes, this is a new kind of sports toy for the kids to ride. Great for using your body and balance. Was ok for the first 2 weeks, then we noticed that the back wheel especially, was flaking away and chunks were falling off of it. Made for a very bumpy ride. Tried to replace the wheels by ordering new ones, but do to command for them they are back ordered? Not really sure, when we are to receive them. So it worked for the first 2 weeks and now it sits. Didn't think it was too expensive at the time of purchase, but for something that can't be used, I wouldn't have paid what we did for it and have it fall apart so soon.
0	Cheap Plastic that Cracks from normal use: I bought one of these several years ago. I was riding it within a few minutes. I am an adult (under 200 lbs) and don't do anything fancy with it. I noticed after riding on occasion over a few weeks that small hairline cracks started forming on both platforms where the torsion bar inters the plastic. This is not properly engineered and I would guess that someone doing tricks on this board could easily break the plastic.
1	GIVES PEACE OF MIND: I am very happy with this product as it gives me assurance and peace of mind that all of my photos will last (at least) my lifetime on these discs (or so they promise). It has been difficult for me to locate any "archival" quality discs in local stores. Once I found out that other (cheaper/regular) discs may lose data over time, I freaked. I only found out about "archival quality" discs by accident on Amazon. After using them (and reading the description), I felt confident enough in these to actually "delete" several GIGS of yearly photo albums from my computer into my recycle bin AND then, permanently delete THAT from my computer! Now that's confidence! Anyone who knows me and my picture taking OBSESSION would be the first in line to buy these, if they needed them!
1	Learning can be fun!: I purchased this for my 4 year old when she started telling me she wanted to learn how to "tie shoes like a big girl". She was excited to start as soon as we received the book, and continues to practice. The poem inside is cute and the laces easy to work.
1	Where to purchase this book (and PDF) online...: This book (under the name "MMURTL V1.0") can be found on Sensory Publishing's website:http://www.sensorypublishing.com/mmurtl.htmlYou can purchase a PDF of the book (and the source of the OS itself), or pay extra for a printed copy in addition to the PDF. (My original review was truncated before the URL for some reason.)
1	So well written, I felt as if I was Vyry.: Best book I have ever read. I recommend this book to everyone, young and old. I am so glad my dad named me after such an intelligent and strong black women.Vyry Marie Herrington
1	Loki does it again: I've recently downloaded the demo. It contains the first 2 maps of the windows version (which I also own). The gameplay is great! I'm using Linux X4 with a 3D Prophet GTS 2, using nvidia's Linux drivers.
1	Q-Copy Replacement Cartridge: This is the first time that I have used the Q-Copy Replacement Cartridge in my Canon PC (E-40). The price was reasonable and I am satisfied with the quality of copies that I have made so far. I recommend this brand for routine copying. I have no complaints and intend to purchase it again!!!
0	Suck(s): Don't waste your money. This movie Sucks. Iggy and Alice, are about the only redeeming qualities here. The only way this will ever be a cult classic, is if you are in a cult and your leader forces you to watch it.
0	Directions are AWFUL: Ordered this based on the product name. The directions are horrendous and make no sense. It is cheaply made and I had to rig it up in order to have the basket sit on the side of the pan as they said.. I would NOT recommend this item!!
0	Pretty but lame: This unit performs well while it lasts, but mine only lasted a few months when using with care. I do not jog. The unit stayed in my car the whole time. It just stopped working.
1	Really worth the price: This cute discman manufactured by Koss have a 40 sec memory for the hard bus time. The overall sound quality is ok and there's a bass boost option that work very well. Beside the cool design, I have to admit that the headphones are not the finest one but remember that price of this Koss player is the Panasonic and Sony 40 sec. models price divided by two !
0	KOSS is a terrible CD player: KOSS is a good bargain if their products actually worked over the long haul. BUT THEY DON'T! Trust me, or you will pay with a couple of 20's and your sanity. I am not the only one, my cousin purchased the same KOSS CD player and one month later he threw it off a 5 story apartment building balcony. It's a piece of crap.
1	Great CD Player!: This CD player is great! IT looks cool, doesn't skip, has the best sound quality I've ever heard, and it's cheap!
0	1 pen, not12.: The description says you get12 pens, but you only get one. Yes $1.90 is a fair price to pay for1 pen, but if I had known it was only one I certainly would not have paid $7.46 for them to mail me one pen! Sounds a little too much like a scam to me. The seller was good enough to refund my money after I contacted them, so if you have bought this pen thinking you would get12, definately contact them and demand a refund. They certainly aren't in any hurry to correct the description as it has been over a month since I bought it and it still says12 pens.Regarding the pen itself, it is far from perfect. It will occasionally spurt out a large amount of paint onto your work with no warning, making a mess of everything, including your clothes. Other than that, the colors are good and when it doesn't squirt it works pretty good.
1	One of my favorite movies: I love action comedy flicks, especially if Bruce Willis is in it. And this one, this movie, is one of the best examples of such genre, another being the Die Hard, of course. The very end of the movie may feel like too smoochy but you can't win 'em all, right?
1	An excellant book for all ages and nationalities: I love reading it, it brings back my childhood, several passages even made we cry as I thought of my Nonna.However, we have a great time reading it with our granddaughrer (12) in the morning with bsicotti and coffee/milk.
1	Great IS and Bokeh: With this lens, I can capture very nice pictures of my kids/nephew/niece. The IS work wells. Handling is good. Bokeh is what I expected.The only thing that I like to have is the Full-Time Manual Focus which it doesn't have.
0	A Solid Lens with drawbacks: This was one of my first lens purchases. I initially enjoyed it however as I became more and more serious about photography I found that this lens was not producing the quality I was looking for. For one, the chromatic abberation at the long end was terrible when the image was viewed at100%. Secondly, when shooting wide open, the images are soft although stopping down a stop or two corrects this. I ended up trading this lens in towards the purchase of an EF 70-200 f/4L IS USM lens.This lens, however, is not a complete loss. The 3-stop IS is fantastic and the focusing is relatively fast and accurate. I would suggest people just starting out on a tight budget purchase this lens if the higher end lenses are simply out of reach especially if you don't plan on making outlandishly huge prints from your photos. That said, if I had to relive this purchase, I would have held out for a lens with a higher resale value and higher quality.
1	The Canon EF 70-300 mm IS is a GREAT lens for the price!!: Bought this lens a few months ago and have been very happy with all the photos since. I don't think you can take a bad picture with this lens. I've taken everything from drag racing pictures of dragsters going 320 MPH, to beautiful zoomed-in shots of flowers and butterflies with amazing results. Can't buy a better lens for the price. It focuses super fast and always takes clear shots. You'll love it !!
1	great: i feel like paparazzi, this is fantasticworked WONDERS while photographing my last wedding; it was like i was standing at the altar with themrecommend
1	Awesome Lens Great Price!!: I had the 70-200 L F/4 usm without the IS, I returned that lens. Without IS it was not worth keeping for me, to many blurry pictures(must be on a tripod) So I exchanged it for this 70-300 IS USM about the same price too. Love it!! Made it all worth while. It's pretty good at up close, not a macro lens. Great with 300mm, Clear and sharp at all ranges. nice walk around lens for me. Very Happy with this purchase.
1	Great lens: Thrilled to see the price drop and I'd been waiting for the telephoto lens for awhile. I weighed the pros and cons of getting this one for my Canon 40d vs an L series lens but decided in the end that this would do nicely in the meantime. I took some excellent shots through my kitchen window of some baby birds and was very pleased with the detail.
0	Over priced...: This lens sells new at Best Buy for $500+, the price they show before the 51% cut is way out of focus... Has never sold for $900+, not even on the Canon Direct web site..
1	Makes Guero look thin....: ...and I gave Guero 5 stars. Beck does it again. DVD is awesome as well. Of all the "keepers of real", Beck keeps it the realest.
0	a mulligan: Putting the stickers on the cover was a wicked blast. It took me 20 minutes and I was so proud of my project, I scanned it and sent it to my mom.The music is typical Beck, the funky side. No "Sea Change" or "Mutations" here. It's perfect background noise, too, for like if you're scrubbing your floors or working on a paper or smoking up.I gave it1 star because the DVD that accompanies the package is the single most self-indulgent tripe I have ever seen in my entire life. Beck is capable of so much better and THAT'S why I feel so put out. and taken advantage of. But it's ok, everyone's entitled to a few mistakes and in a career like Beck's, there haven't been many. I'll give him a mulligan.
0	Cumbersome and cheap: Forget this camera. After owning several digital camera's over the years and knowing how to operate them after only a couple of days it takes constant programming for every picture you take in order to get a good photo. This is not the camera for just grabbing and taking a photo. It requires thought and total concentration to just get an acceptable photo. I'd buy an off the shelf Kodak from Kmart before buying this one again.
0	The Camera that wasn't: I cannot review this product for you because the seller has never sent it to me. Nor has my money been returned. I am very disgusted with the whole business. It's too bad. It looked like a good camera.
0	worst movie ever!!!!!!: don't waste your money one of the worst movies I have ever seen no plot, vague story line, just terrible
1	Too Large: I had to return this card because it wouldn't fit in the available computer space. So I really did not have a chance to use it. I have an HP 8760C. The card is about10 inches long. So just make sure you measure the available space.
1	Better than the original: It pains me to say that. But these instrumentals are much better than the versions with vocals. Sorry dude, but you're not a great singer. "Clean Living" was awesome. But that doesn't mean you have to sing on every track. Stick to what you do best: making beats. For other vocalists. Or, as is the case here and on most of his best older songs, instrumentals. If you didn't like 'The Third Hand' before, give this one a shot. I consider it the better album.
0	Good Product money wise but not Safe: I am very much impressed with the quality of the Leather Pouch from my new Treo . I was very happy of the same . However While traveling as it was hooked to my trouser , my Treo fell down twice from this Pouch . As it does not have a Locking Facility , It creates a Problem . It has just a Magnetic flap which is of no use when your Expensive Treo Falls down Twice and has a Lot of Scratches on them . Hence if they would only have a Locking facility on the Flap it would be great.
1	Very, Very Good CD.......: ....I was very impressed with this CD. I had heard of this band, but never purchased their first CD. Though, now after listening to this one, I will get my hands on whatever this band has released. I would love to see them in concert. I can't wait till them come to Ohio!
1	Like the mat, love the length: This mat's color pretty much resembles the picture, a pastel green. Being 5'9", I love the length of the mat and have no problems with any poses. The thickness vs the weight is right-on for my needs. I would prefer something just a *little* more thicker for my knees, but I wouldn't want anything heavier for classes.The mat does tend to slip a little bit in the beginning, but it wasn't too bad. You can just use a yoga towel if you tend to be a heavy sweater (I'm not at all, and I only had slippage problems with my hands in downward dog)Overall, I think this was a nice mat at a great price.
1	Very pleased: The process was very quick and easy. My book arrived quicker than I expected and was in excellent condition.
1	Victims No Longer: This is an excellent book. I am a counselor and the issues addressed regarding male child sexual abuse are so important. So many males have been molested and/or incested and carry shame, so that they, perhaps more than females, do not report it. Yet, these unresolved issues carry into adult sexual and friendship relationships until they are healed. I bought a copy for myself to use clinically and one for a friend who is a survivor of incest.
0	Unsatisfied: I am not satisfied with the item i purchased from you. The item frequently freezes and stops, making it difficult to play. It does this everytime i try to play. It's still malfunctioning and i would love if you help to resolve the issue. I really had my plans on enjoying a game of Sims 2, but this game will not function correctly. Ever since i received the package it has been malfunctioning incorrectly. I will not play and constantly stops and freezes up. I would LOVE a full refund if you cant resolve the issue. Thanks.
1	A MUST READ FOR EVERYONE!: Absolutely my favorite novel. It's a long one, but everyone should read it...men and women. Not only is is accurate historically, but it is also educational and interesting. The novel is far richer than the movie, and although the motion picture is a spectacle....the book puts the movie to shame. Read the book, and watch the movie again afterwards. The differences are astounding....but that is what keeps the novel interesting to modern readers. It's isn't the exact story we have seen on film on TCM again and again. Again, everyone should read this book. It has literary value, historic value, and pleasure value.
1	gone with the wind: One of my all time favorite books, one I have read several times. A true classic. It brings the South to life.
0	A wannabe "War & Peace.": Written during the Great Depression when Americans needed escapism, GWTW and the resulting movie it spawned are primarily responsible for distorting many Americans impressions of slavery, as well as trivializing the horror of the Civil War. If you like your history covered with moonlight and magnolias and sugar-coated beyond all reality GWTW is just what you are looking for. After all, its only fiction. Problem is, too many people over the years have come to regard it as almost gospel. In the end, GWTW is little more than a cheap attempt to create an American version of Tolstoy's "War & Peace."
1	The Best Book Ever: My paper back is barely going to withstand another reading since I have nearly worn it out. I actually read the book before seeing the movie. I was very disappointed! The movie made Scarlett seem so evil, but in the book she depicted more as a strong woman who did what she had to do to survive. The only thing that would be better than reading this book again, would be to have the audio version so I could listen to it in the car.
1	Used but Good Book: The copy is a1940's print, and is definitely used.I would have liked a bit more info in its cover condition, (It had parts of the original in a plastic protective sleeve) and the book was very musty.However, the pictures inside were beautiful and the book itself was in good condition.It made a wonderful present for my GWTW obsessed friend.Now to see if I can find myself a copy...
0	It didn't work and spoilt my coffee maker as well: Well, I am pretty disappointed with this prodcut as it spoilt my new Krups coffee maker as well. Its supposed to take loads of upto1600 Watts but my1200 Watt coffee maker was apparently too much for it to handle.
1	great gift for soon-to-be moms: I bought this and a few other Bella B items for my sister-in-law who is expecting; she loves all of the products.
0	.: This book was just not for me. I don't see the sun let alone the beach...that should have been my first clue.
0	Not for every taste.: I'm not into this eccentric approach of this major work. After having a long tradition of superb recordings of thissymphony by Karajan (1963), Fricsay, Furtwängler, Abendroth and Bernstein (DG), this Celi bizarre reading could be a bitof shocking to anyone. If you are fond of a weird phrasing and tempi, deliberate rubato and bizarre unbalance, this couldbe your perfect choice.
0	Ended up not liking Bobby Fischer: I must respect Bobby Fischer as a player. But I learned some stuff that doesn't make me respect him as a person. I have read more things about Fischer which this book leaves out and should have been put in.
1	A Good Sample: This is a good sample of swinging tunes Mulligan recorded with other top notch saxophonists. A nice blend of standards and Mulligan originals. The highlights are the Zoot Sims-Mulligan and Paul Desmond-Mulligan teams. Favorite tunes are 'Chelsea Bridge,18 Carrots For A Rabbit, and Line For Lyons." Fine out of production sampler of some of Mulligan's brightest moments. If you can find yourself a copy, highly recommended.
1	THE1.33:1 ASPECT RATIO WAS HOW IT WAS INTENDED: Some customers here, according to their reviews, suggest not buying the DVD because it is not in the widescreen format. According to Donald Richie's "The Films of Akira Kurosawa," the definitive analysis of his filmography (film by film), Kurosawa did not work with the widescreen format until1958 with "Hidden Fortress". So "Samurai" is shown in its original format on Criterion's DVD. Hope that clears up the confusion.
1	Great collection for a film buff !: Any time a Criterion Collection edition of a DVD comes out, it is usually worth the few extra bucks it will cost you.This presentation of "Seven Samurai" is fantastic. Great features on the 3rd disc, and the book is great reading.If you want to call yourself a REAL movie buff, this has to be on your shelf !
1	One of the greats...: A cinematic giant, now on DVD.Probably the best movie to ever come from the east, and the basis for some of the great American westerns.
0	The template: Like many of Akira Kurosawas films this is a template for basic storytelling that has been referenced, borrowed or used over and over again. Truely a masterpiece.
1	A great story: There are many accolades and volumes of in depth analysis for this film, so my review will be short.The good: Strong, weak, sad, wise, frail, crazy, calm, etc; the full gamut of characters that really work together to twist complex situations. The story keeps you guessing first time. It is timeless and the subitles did not bother me...because the pace of the movie is easy enough to keep up with reading but also watching.The bad: It can move too slow at times and I had to break up the film and view over two nights.Conclusion: This is a movie I will watch again, probably a few times if lucky.
1	One of the top ten best films -EVER.: Not only one of the best Samurai films, but one of the most perfectly made films ever! The story is well made, the realistic characters are played by powerful actors (one of them being Toshiro Mifune), with lots of drama, humor, philosohpy AND all in 207 minutes! What more could you ask for? Oh, don't forget the ACTION!The DVD, of course, also has extras, like audio commentary and the original US theatrical trailer.
1	Unforgettable: This is absolutely the best movie to be filmed. Ever. I have seen a ton of movies but this was the best. Even though it has a simple storyline, it's a very complicated film. The characters are very well developed, Kurosawa is a born genius. It runs over 3 hours, but it is so interesting that you WILL keep watching it! It has action, humor, suspense and much more.The story is set in the1600's in a small village. The village is constantly being robbed of their crops by bandits and the townsfolk want to hire unemployed samurai to defend themselves, only giving them food instead of money. Enjoy the film, you will love it.
1	And you thought kids watch teen movies!: I first saw this movie on the action channel. I remembered it and bought it on a DVD. Me, being a fan of these samurai movies, loved it. Great acting, phenominal battle scenes, and cool sword slashing samurai. If you like samurai movies,16th century Japan, played and liked Onimusha: Warlords and Shogun: Total War, buy this. Oh yeah...I once saw this samurai film on the Bravo Channel. It was about the Takeda Clan and the Uesugi Clan. At the end there was this battle, I think it was the battle of 4th Kawanakajima. At the end it showed the Takeda Shingen and Kenshin Uesugi fighting in a pond. Then after Shingen was injured, Kenshin went away with his calvary in an arrow formation going against the wave of Yari spearmen going back to camp. If you know what the name of this movie is...post a review on this page that tells the name....Thanks.
1	The best movie ever made: This is the best film of Akira Kurosawa and the best film ever made. Citizen Kane is as good as this movie, but cannot make you feel the same emotion. The history of the cinema never was the same after Seven Samurais.
1	Check the original aspect ratio nefore you complain...: I'm sick of all the people that complain "Why isn't it in letterbox/widescreen?!! I can't believe they butchered it and put it in fullscreen!" etc. It was shot in1.33:1 ratio, and its displayed here in its original ratio, so before you complain about it and give them grief, know what you're talking about. All it takes is a little google search or god forbid a look at the box where it says "original aspect ratio..."...and I never thought that sitting through 3+ hours of a 50s Japanese film would fly by faster than most of the1.5 hour movies I see today. I was never board for a second. But I can see how it may not be some people's thing. Since Criterion are expensive, just give it a rent first.
0	didnt like it.: didnt like this movie at all. did not find it beautiful, did not find any of the characters even remotely interesting. in fact if you asked me i could not tell you who the main character was. Kurosawa was praised for his camera work, in showing all the major characters, but that's exactly the problem. yes the characters were major but WHO was the main? also, for a film that sets the standard for action films, ive watched almost all of it (prolly1 hour lefT) and havent seen one fighting sequence. or anything.
0	One of the most boring movies ever!: I guess I should preface this by saying that I'm really not an Asian-movie person. I just don't "get" them, and I'm sure it's a cultural thing. "Tampopo," "Crouching Tiger," "In the Realm of the Senses" and now this one -- I couldn't sit through any of them. Unless you are a martial arts or samurai fanatic, or a big lover of Japanese culture and history, I would say definitely skip this -- especially if you are female. I think this is one of those "Emperor's New Movies" that we're all supposed to like, and no one will admit to NOT liking it for fear of being thought ignorant!
1	A Monument to the Writing Life: No cartoon series is followed more closely by writers than Peanuts and no dog understands writers better than Snoopy. Writers love the Snoopy cartoons but most writers will be amazed that there are so many of them. Now you can have a complete collection.Barnaby Conrad is the director of the Santa Barbara Writer's Conference. Charles Schulz drew huge crowds each time he spoke there.As an author, I will treasure this very special book.Dan Poynter, ParaPublishing.com
0	CAREFUL: Cheap, yes. But these are low quality media: Radius Technology DVDs ID as "OPTODISC" brand media. (That is, OPTODISC makes the discs for Radius). OPTODISC media are generally found to be lousy: poor compatibility with many burners and many "coaster" (unreadable) burns. Amazon has high quality RIDATA blanks for a little more money. I highly recommend you buy them instead. Save yourself a lot of headaches and (if you store anything of importance) heartbreak. There really *IS* a significant difference between very cheap DVD media (like these) and better DVD media (like the Ridata).
0	As a teacher, I found the "sports coach" tone distracting.: There are already dozens of creative writing "how to" books on the market...Why make a student spend this much for a book that's overloaded and at times condescending.
0	Disappointed: First of all, the rating I gave this DVD is based on the poor quality of the tape transfer not the movie itself. I happen to enjoy this movie.I would rate it 4 stars. When you have Errol Flynn, Olivia DeHavilland, President Reagan, and an outstanding performance by Raymond Massey, how can you go wrong? Yes, it's not a historically accurate by and large. But who cares? And really how many Hollywood produced movies are? Just kick back and enjoy this piece of pure escapism. A western full of colorful characters set during the days prior to the Civil War with glorious names (e.g; Jefferson Davis, Robert E. Lee, George Armstrong Custer, J.E.B Stuart, John Brown, etc.) from our American history. However, the tape transfer is horrible. It's grainy and dark in some scenes. It's hard to watch. And there are no extras to it. I would recommend to avoid buying this Synergy Archive Series copy. Let's hope Warner Bros. decides one day to restore this film and market it.
1	High on the list of movies that p**s off liberals: While this movie seems to flaunt its disregard for historical accuracy, it's still a fun adventure romp with several well known figures from American history. Errol Flynn as JEB Stuart is a blast as he battles straight-arrow rival Ronald Reagan (George Custer) in love and war. Raymond Massey is chilling as homicidal maniac John Brown and Olivia De Havilland is a peach. The whole film is refreshing for its unapologetic rejection of the post-bellum political orthodoxy imposed on the whole country which beatified John Brown and sanctified the Glorious Cause that slaughtered some 600,000 Americans. I'm sure it must have raised some eyebrows even in1940, never mind today. In all, it's a fun movie which gains a lot of extra points for its delightful political incorrectness.
1	Great for Travelers: I recently came back from a trip to Australia. Not only was this book invaluable for everyday communication, but the section on Australian slang saved me from being totally lost when talking to Aussies. A must for any traveler to a country where British English is spoken. The comprehensive list of word comparisons make this a serious reference book, but the expressions and idioms are what make this book fun to read! Explanations on acronyms such as ZIP code and Amtrak, as well as unraveling the mystery as to why Americans drive on the right and Brits on the left make this a great book for resolving disputes. My only criticism is that I would have liked to have seen a few more of the humorous illustrations which help to lighten up the book.
0	A Semi-Interesting Mess: The book is largely a glossary - perhaps almost half - which doesn't exactly make for Interesting reading. Some terms were terribly out of date, others wildly obscure, and at worst, just plain useless and random. I love both the UK and language, and I found this book a badly done bore. Also, shame on the publisher for the crappy formatting. I finished about 60% of it before giving up, and I normally eat this stuff up.
1	Love it or Hate it, It's Still Great Prose: I enjoyed this book and it was well written. It's a nice reflection of spirit of the time and it's well constructed. I've noticed that people either love or hate this book, but I'm wondering how much of the reaction of those who hate it is due to false expectations based on the movie Stone Reader. I think this book will appeal to those who enjoy literary writers similar to James Joyce and love reading well fashioned prose. However, if you're searching for a book that will change the way you think about the world or this piece of American history, you may be disappointed. The book is excellent for what it is: beautiful prose about a writer's experience growing up in a culturally empty place in a particular time.
0	Not Believable: The book is unbelievable as in NOT believable. No way is it reality to beleive eight-year-old boys in Iowa, in early1950s, would know, much less use such language.
0	You have to love this book: When I found this book in the book store and read the cover it sounded like a very good read. After looking over some of the pages I was a bit taken aback by some of the prose but thought it would turn out to be a good read. I was wrong.You have to love this book to finish it. I struggled through several tedious pages trying to figure out what the heck Mossman was trying to say, finally giving up and putting it away.The characters weren't very well explained and the conversations they have are just plain boring. Mossman's descriptive style reminded this reader of the hippy-speak of the sixties. It didn't make sense then and it doesn't make any now.
0	Adobe InDesign CS2@work: This book would only suit a desktop publisher rather than a Prepress or Graphic Designer, I found it failing in the concept of Type and general overall usage.
1	This book is fantastic.: I have long wanted to cook Indian at home, and this book has helped me do that (well!) I have made several recipes from this book, the most notable being the "Heavenly Korma" which far exceeded any Korma I have had in a restaurant. I am so glad to have come across this book, and I'm sure I'll refer to it for years to come.
1	The Last Trail: This is the last of a trilogy published in1909 after "Betty Zane" (1903) and "Spirit of the Border" (1906). It's a historical novel set in the Ohio River Valley in the late18th century shortly after The American Revolution. It focuses on two bordermen assigned to protect the settlement at Fort Henry. Bordermen are self-appointed protectors of the region and both are very capable. They set out on the trail to determine who the renegades are that are stealing Fort Henry horses and kidnapping the women. Also, there appears to be a traitor at Fort Henry helping the renegades. The love interest of one of the bordermen causes him to question whether to continue his duties on the trail or devote his life completely to Helen. Zane Grey paints a beautiful picture of the region.
0	not a novel: Having read a few of his novels I was looking forward to another of his stories about different generations in Japan. Instead I found a detailed and tedious history of tea. I gave up after a couple of hours.
0	Ok: Didn't really interest me enough to read mire than first couple of pages. Probably wouldn't buy again. To others though this could be their book.
1	Real Samba: Contrary to the review by "Music Fan" of North America, this IS real samba, authentic as the life of Brazilian black people and habitants of the favelas of Rio de Janeiro. Moreira and Sargento are two of the greatest masters of samba. They are not professional singers, but influential composers and artists. If you want to get experienced in this kind of art, don't hesitate to buy it. If you want an easier introduction, try the David Byrne compilation. It's the "best" through his eyes, or ears, but Brazilian music is much more than that.
1	Price Hard To Beat: I have the 2 LP's bought in the last1970's and have the 2seperate CD's from several years ago. You're definately going to find(dollar amount) worth of rock music and rock ballads here. Hard rockers Witch Wolf, Young Man, Winner Take All, Rock & Roll Feeling, Havin A Ball and Man of Miracles are the best of JY's songs. Reminds me why I wished he would've contributed more to Brave New World. Dennis is great on The Grove of Eglantine, teaming up with JY on 22 Years, A Song For Suzanne, Lies and Christopher Mr Christopher. Former guitarist John Curlewski screams out The Serpent Is Rising with ferocity. The band's patented backing vocals are in full force here. If you're a Styx fan and have gone as far back as Crystal Ball and Equinox, you might as well go all out and get this double set as well as Styx I and II. They're well worth it.
0	McLaughlin leaves us waiting: I have been an avid follower of John Mclauglin's method of crafting an art called fusion. Though the Mahavishnu days are over and John's prior attempts at smooth jazz have been successful, this release is sour and dull. Though John does execute his technical prowess (ie. "chops") as always and the band plays beautifully, the tone of his guitar ensures a lackluster mood when listening. The album is somber. I don't think the pick-up, tone, distortion, or chorus settings on his guitar were changed throughout the entire album. blah-blah-boring-blah.
1	This Novel Is What Great Writing Is All About!!: I recently finished reading this novel and fell in love with the characters, the story itself and the message of both good and evil, as well as the concept of "Timshel" or "Thou Mayest".John Steinbeck is without a doubt a superb storyteller. "East of Eden" has many facets and dimensions within it. Somehow or another Steinbeck is able to write a multi-dimensional story with phenomenal characters and keep the entire novel cohesive from start to finish.I had a difficult to wanting to do anything but read this novel once I started reading it. The writing is fantastic and entertaining... The characters are fabulous and there was always so much going on in this novel that you eagerly want to find out what is going to happen next!This is a must read novel. Steinbeck is such a wonderful writer that I can see why he won the Nobel Prize for Literature!
1	One of the 5 Greatest Novels Ever Written: Perhaps every great novelist has one truly great novel. "The Grapes of Wrath" is outstanding, but "East of Eden" is Steinbeck's best novel and one (1) of the five (5) greatest novels ever written (in my opinion).Not only does Steinbeck make Genesis Chapter 4 the centerpiece of this novel, he literally wagers the success of this novel on one (1) Hebrew word found in Genesis Chapter 4: "Timshel" ("thou mayest"). Steinbeck wins the wager. Actually, he breaks the casinos-all of them-at Vegas by basing his novel around "Timshel."This book is a stunning work of achievement. If you enjoy fiction, you should love "East of Eden."
1	A "boring masterpiece": There were times, in the middle of the book, when I was so bored by the writing style and I wanted to stop reading it. But I was patient and it paid off. At times I wanted to give the novel two stars, then three stars, then four stars, and it probably deserves a full mark. But I'm keeping it at four stars to tell some readers, especially those who haven't read classics before, that it's not an easy read.I've read "The Da Vinci Code" and "Angels and Demons" by Dan Brown before reading this. They were entertaining throughout, but you forget them the moment you finish them. East of Eden, although boring at times, had an impact on me and changed the way I look at life. It just gives you wisdom and a new perspective. And that's what makes a book a great book. I may revisit this epic again.
1	Steinbeck goodness: This is the best book I've read so far. Steinbeck is amazing at drawing you into the story. I recommend this book to everyone.
0	Plastic!: It is almost impossible to determine if these wall supplies and holders are solid or plastic. Even the spec sheets don't always tell you. So I will let you know that if you are looking for solid brass don't buy this item as it is plastic and weighs almost nothing. I can't imagine this holding up to constant use by putting a heavy shower head in and out of it. And it is very expensive for a piece of plastic. I will keep looking.
1	I work here. Trust me. It's the best thing ever written.: I am a writer for the new National Lampoon that is launching in late September. There are only 3 of us here now, but believe me, sometimes it is hard writing under the shadow of the genius that created the yearbook parody. It is THE National Lampoon issue to own. You'll never laugh harder.
1	Please Reprint!: Will the world listen to the plea of thousands and reprint this masterpiece of 60's parody!!! I cannot face the future without seeing Ms. Armbruster one more time! Also, I need to see the Dacron, Ohio newspaper parody too! Please, dear lord, to see the joy in my teenage children's eyes as they read these wonders for the first time would hearten my soul forever!!!
1	Go PATS!: Bought this for wife as a stocking stuffer. I'm sure she'll enjoy backing her team without taking up the whole window.
1	Classic: John Carpenter's Halloween tells the story of an escaped mental patient Michael Myers(Nick Castle)Michael was locked up for15 years after he killed his sister.Dr.Loomis(Donald Pleasence) is on a frantic search for michael, Loomis knows Michael will return home to kill.Laurie Strode(Jamie Lee Curtis) a shy teenager is being stalked unknowingly by Michael.As the night goes on Michael kills her friends till it comes down to Laurie and Michael.The Screenplay was done by John Carpenter and Debra Hill.Great script one of the best of the genre.And John Carpenter directing was top notch. He creates the perfect mood and will make you feel trapped just like the characters.Donald Pleasence and Jamie Lee were awesome in their roles.And the score by John Carpenter was very chillingThe Halloween DVD is loaded with must see extras
0	Nowadays, this is pure B-comedy!: The first one in the series of (so far?) seven Halloween movies probably was a superbly scary thriller-horror movie in1978 - but for today's public, it rather appears as a comedy.There is barely any blood in it, and Michael Myers is easy to knock down (even though he doesn't die, of course...) by a young Jamie Lee Curtis who, by the way, look like herself, she only had longer hair and a smaller behind back then.The real surprise in fact comes in the beginning of the movie where we see who Michael Myers really is!
1	The best! I had to watch the last of it with the lights on!!: This is my favorite movie of all time. It all begins when Lori (CURTIS) is babysitting 2 kids when psycho serial killer Michael Myers murders her friends and comes after her. I loved the ending and the rest of it. About half way through the movie, I got so terrorfied that I had to turn on the lights! This movie is so horrorfying, that it still grips you with fear long after the movie is over!
0	They Cropped out the Boobs: The movie speaks for itself. However, they cropped out Linda's boobs when she's laying in bed. That's one of my favorite parts!!!!(no pun intended) You see them 20 seconds later when she gets strangled on the phone so WTF!
1	Absolutely Scary!: This would have to be one of the alltime scary movies.The roleof Michael Meyers steals the film. Meyers escapes from an insane asylum and returns home. His doctor played by Donald Pleasancegoes hunting for the evil Michael Myers. The villain of this movie starts killing the members of two groups of teenagers whoare celebrating Halloween.He is scary. After several killings by Meyers the movie comes to a conclusion. The doctor finally locates Meyers and shoots him several times blowing him off the balcony. The movie has a creepy ending with the supposedly killedMichael Myers nowhere to be found.The music at the end of the movie is absolutely creepy. Jamie Lee Curtis in the role of thebabysitter does an exceptional role. This is a must see movie. Buy it.
1	Best Slasher Film Ever!!: When a little six year old boy named Micheal Myers stabs his sister in cold blood to death, then you got one Hell of a problem. John Carpenters Halloween set the standards for every slasher movie to date, John Carpenter is a genuis, Next to Remero and his Dead films. Im not to crazy about the sequels to this film, but Halloween will always be a great movie. Micheal Myers Stabs His sister to death and is sent away to a Maximum Security Hospital for life, But escapes in a stolen station wagon, driven by Dr. Sam Loomis (Donald Pleasence), Who's Mission is to find Myers and put him away for good before lives are risked. Anyway, Micheal goes after his sister Lorrie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) Who changed her Last name because of her Psycho Brother, and some of her friends who get in the way, and its up to Dr. Loomis to stop him. John Carpenter even made up the creepy music score on a piano himself. This film is as good as it can get, it gets two thumbs up.
1	Best horror movie ive ever seen: If youre looking for a halloween movie to rent or buy then i definitely would go with halloween1. This is a great movie with plenty of violence and gore. It is interesting and exciting to watch. This movie should be every horror movie fan's favorite.
1	An absolute masterpiece of Terror!!!: This DVD, released last year, is an absolutely terrific representation of John Carpenter's vision of terror in a suburban setting. The picture is nice and crisp, thanks to THX, the sound and video system developed by Lucasfilm, a great restoration of this true classic of horror. In the film, Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) is terrorized by the man who later is found out to be her brother, Michael Myers, an unstoppable juggernaut of a masked killer. Myers is pursued by his Doctor, Sam Loomis (Donald Pleasance in a very memorable role), who seems to encounter hints of Myers' evil as he chases him down to attempt to apprehend or kill him. 30 years later, this film still does not disappoint to frighten everyone. But hey, as Sheriff Leigh Brackett points out, "Everyone's entitled to one good scare." Plus there is a terrific behind the scenes featurette, along with cast bio and behind-the-scenes photos. Get this one if you can. 5 stars!!!
0	Oh, please!!: I know Halloween is a classic, but it would be nice if it was a good classic. This is the second worst movie I've ever seen(the worst is Friday The13th). I like to watch horror movies but watching this is just a wast of time. Almost the whole movie is boring, it's not scary at all and it's just very poorly made. If you want something scary go buy The Amityville Horror, that movie is good. Halloween does not deserve to be a classic, so don't waste your time and money!
0	This sucks...: This is the worst movie of all time. I rented it once, and let me tell you, I almost tossed my PSP at the wall. It was just way to scary. It was scary+100. My sister almost peed her pants when she saw it. If you have any mind at all, don't buy(that is, of course, you're still wearing diapers).
1	Nice but not what i expected: i saw this movie recently in this updated format. its good but was not what i expected from a all time horror classic. I am not saying its bad but its not worth the publicity it gets .
1	The Classic Horror Movie: The story deals with a character named Michael Myers, who at the age of six stabbed his sister to death with a kitchen knife. After spending about a decade in a mental hospital he escapes and goes on a murderous rampage in his hometown Haddonfield. Halloween is loaded with thrills and chills that would keep about every horror buff entertained. Scripted and Directed by John Carpenter.
1	The Begining of the best Horror Series Ever!: Halloween is an instant classic. Jamie Lee Curtis and Donald Pleansance did the best acting. This movie is very mysterious, because you don't know why Micheal is going after Laurie. This isn't my favorite, though. Here's my best to worst: H4, H5(it was great), H1, H6(the t-cut! haven't seen p-cut) H2, H20, H8( wasn't bad.),H3 (it sucked).
1	A Must Have For Every Horror Buff: Halloween is a original and scary horror movie that deals with a disturbed male named Michael Myers that goes on a infamous mass murdering rampage in his hometown Haddonfield.
0	Poor DVD transfer: The transfer to DVD is very poor (worse I have seen yet). There are so many artifacts in the video as well as black portions of the letter box that is can be quite distracting. The movie is a great movie but save the dough and by it on VHS or see in when it is on cable.
0	"Kane Hodder should have played Michael...": Well, I liked the music in it, it was really good, but, sadly, it lacks a lot of Michael Myers. What I mean is, it doesn't show his face/mask a lot. Plus, Michael Myers is just plain looking, Jason and Freddy are more dead and scarier than this. But, the score was great, and the whole concept was good. Another thing, the body count was too low! Jason usually takes out10 to 20 people in every one of his movies. And plus, Michael Myers should have been played by Kane Hodder, than he would have been a lot creepier than whoever plays Myers now. Jamie Lee Curtis was an extremely bad actor, and her voice was just too manly! So, I'd really only recommend this because you need to watch it to understand the whole concept and because it has an excellent score, but if you understand the whole thing already (I mean, before seeing any of the movies) than do not watch this.
0	Utterly Ridiculous: Anyone who thinks this is a "definitive" version or a "director's cut" is sadly misinformed. For the record, Carpenter filmed these 'extra' scenes for tv as the censors had cut so much material from the theatrical release that it wouldn't fill the necessary time-slot. That's why the 'new' scenes are not widescreen. Furthermore, and more importantly, Carpenter has said that he HATES these scenes. Just his to his own words on the Criterion LaserDisc commentary. That this version is marketed and hyped is pathetic.
1	Halloween Blu-Ray: I am grading this solely on the blu-ray quality since everyone and their dog has seen this movie and probably come to the conclusion that this is a horror classic if not the best horror movie of all time.The quality of of this blu-ray is great. They did a great job cleaning this up for blu-ray material. This blu-ray paired with my LG7600 Clearmotion technology made this movie look like it was filmed yesterday. This movie was not filmed in the best of conditions and the equipment and film was not very good, but you would never know it when you watch this on blu-ray. I was really impressed.Now I am 30 so I wasn't alive when this movie came out, but I do appreciate the greatness of the movie. If I had to pick my top two horror flicks I would pick Exorcist and Halloween (in no certain order). They just don't make movies like they use to. My generation just can't figure it out. I highly recommend this for any HD enthusiast, and especially Halloween fans.
0	Where's the ending?: There is no real ending in this book. After the reading the last chapter the book leaves you asking yourself, then what? The characters are interesting and Nancy is surely a woman to stay away from and not unlike some women I have known in my lifetime. Your led to believe in the book that the climatic scene will have something to do with the theft of a large amount of money that they have been talking about for half of the book, but it ends with indecision about the heist and it leaves the reader clueless about several points.
1	Grandmothers life: I liked the book because it gave me an idea what my grandmother's life might have been like. She came west in1903 with her parents to homestead in Washington.
1	Look at life from one womens perspective.: Great look back to life at a slower pace when our country was younger. One womens recanting her life after a move to Wyoming to settle our land.
1	Letter from a Woman Homesteader: This was not my favorite book. I thought it was to simplistic. I received the book in a timely fashion and would consider buying from this seller again, however I did not care for the book.
0	lois: I read it for a book club. It was a Kindle free book. It was over priced. It was a waste of time.
1	Water wings: They fit my18 month old son great. The Velcro is kind of a pointless feature. The strap that is suppose to stick didn't even really reach when the floats are fully inflated.I have a problem with the valves not sealing and letting air out quicker than I can plug them up. I reported the problem to the company, and they sent a replacement pair immediately. Unfortunately, I had the same problem with the second pair. I think it may just be the way they're made.
1	Great price, great taste: This ingredient is used in cooking in Australia and probably other parts of Asia, but not easily found in the U.S. Or at least not where I live. It adds a great taste to the sweets that I have made and it's probably used in Asian cooking as well. I read that you can make it yourself out of unsweetened coconut, but this was just easier.
1	Very interesting: The book that I read was So. B. It by Sarah Weeks. This book is realistic fiction because it could really happen to someone.So. B. It is about a girl named Heidi. Her mom has something wrong with her, and can not speak. Her next door neighbor, Bernie, lives with her. When Heidi was looking through her kitchen drawers, she found an old disposable camera. When she got the film developed there was a picture of her mom and grandma that she did not know about. But in the background she saw a sign and it said Hilltop Home. After that she found out more than she knew. I enjoyed this book because it was very adventurous. If people enjoy sad and adventurous stories than this is the book for you. I also liked this book because it said that you can do `' anything you want without anyone stopping you.'' I think this book is best suited for sixth graders and12 and13 year olds.
1	Excellent: I saw this movie back in the 80's when we first got our cable television. I've always wanted to see it again and am also a big Albert Finney fan. It was exactly as I wanted it, bringing up nostalga. It is not a four star (11/2) movie for many more than myself. I was excited to have found it and now own it. Thanks.
1	Forgotten movie: I have been looking for this movie for years. I remember it from when I was just a kid. It was nice to have finally gotten my hands on it and been able to see it again. The movie was ahead of its time. The basic idea is a company starts using digital representations of real life models and no longer needs the real person anymore. This movie came out in the1980's, so imagine that! The movie has more suspense too as the models are being killed.
1	A Good Story: My only regret with this book is that I think I read it out of order. I believe that Trinity was the first of a two part story. But even by itself it stands as a really compelling story. I wasn't prepared for the places it would take me. It was surprising but nice to be transported to New Zealand. And the story of a very bloody battle (Gallipoli) which I had no previous idea of. I first thought that Leon Uris would only be an author of middle east books (having read Exodous and The Haj). But it was a pleasant surprise to find he is a master story teller.
0	Redemption: As other readers have noted, this book is not nearly the book Trinity is. Wish I hadn't read it, the first was so good.I guess that's the trouble with sequels.
1	This is a gripping epic that leaves one filled with emotion: This is one of the best books I have ever read, and it lead me to read "Trinity" the book before it. Mr. Uris truly endows the characters with realistic personalities and puts them in situations so gripping that one can feel as though they are actually there. I enjoyed this book immensely and I hope you will give it a try. -Chris Muller
1	Superb collection of short stories about southern life.: After reading this book about family values and interpersonal relationships among a rural southern family I wanted to cry. Ms Hatchett has put into words the feelings and experiences of those people who have grown-up and become parents in the south. Her collection of short stories encompasses all aspects of family life. There is illness, birth, death, and sibling rivalry. The author lives in rural Georgia and was obviously very observant and sensitive during her formative years. Her description of her family is painted with love and emotion and in such detail that the reader feels that they know every intimate detail of her family life. This book IS the life of a southern lady. All southeners and those who want to share the southern experience must read this book.
1	Nice Fit: I bought this clutch hose for my old 95 Ford Probe. It fits perfectly and working great. This part is rare to find and I have tried different local auto part dealers but no luck. I then tried Amazon and found it. Great price!
0	A Student Perspective: As a student, I have found this book to be a very difficult read. The chapters were filled with impossible to understand details. Perhaps for a practitioner the book is useful, but as an introductory textbook in a university course, it proved to be a very thick volume with litte useful information.
1	Good Read: This is a good view of the triumpial entry and Christs lasts days on earth from the perspective of the high priests right hand man/jewish slave. He is asked to be apart of Christs arrest and is the man whose ear is cut off and healed. He of course is transformed into a follower and we see his journey and what's required of him from then on.We did his in book club, and most of the ladies loved this book.
1	Doesn't get any better!: I had never read historical fiction until this, and what I read was absolutely unforgettable! Through the eyes of Malchus, a servant of Caiaphas, and a skeptic, he finds out for himself who Jesus truly is. This book will make you think. What are you willing to stand up for? At what cost? Awesome! Beautiful picture of what Christianity is and should be all about!
1	They are amazing: I can honestly say that I have never had the experience of the other reviewer, and I have used over a dozen of these candles.I love them as I currently have 3 dogs, 2 cats and 3 rabbits in the house; you can imagine how much that would smell if I didn't do anything to help. My vet office is who recommended that I try them. These candles not just cover the odor, the get rid of it and then leave a refreshing smell- I have even moved one to a bathroom during a stinky guest's visit with great results. I have usually used the orange or strawberry, but plan on buying the vanilla today.
0	Don't bother: Interestingly enough, this product was offered on the HP site when I ordered my new DV9000 laptop. As previous reviews have stated, it is indeed made of low grade plastic. I find it puzzling that HP would recommend this item, considering the fans line up in no way whatsoever with the laptop's cooling fans. The USB cord is too long and comes with an ON/OFF slide switch (which failed quickly). I cut the switch and wired it directly; it worked OK for a while. Now the USB plug on the chill pad itself has to be in just the right position to power the fans. A waste of money; don't bother.
0	Short Lifespan: This cooling fan worked for about 6 months before the USB power cable frayed and it developed cracks in the plastic. I wouldn't recommend it if you're going to be messing with the cord much.
0	Poorly crafted, no noticeable affects.: My laptop has no difference in temperature than sitting on hardwood. So it's job of cooling my laptop left a lot to be desired, but hey, it angled it nicely for typing. About a month after I bought it though, one of the rubber pads that elevates your computer slid off, it was merely glued. I can't imagine what I could have done to prevent this, as it never left my desk... so I'm going to attribute this to poor craftsmanship.All in all I love Targus products but this felt like trash, you get what you pay for definitely is true here.
0	it broke: I started using this product in the beginning of July and less than two months later it broke. I treated it very carefully and held it properly and followed all the directions. While I was using it it did the job but not for long.
0	Complete piece of garbage: Purchased this item, power cord started bugging out within a month. Had to forcefully tape the cord into the back of the unit after it crapped out to even get it to perform marginally.Huge waste of money.
1	Works like a charm...: This Chill Pad works great. Keeps my P4 notebook nice and cool. My notebook fan, which used to run constantly, is now silent. Fans on cooler so quiet, I often forget to turn it off when I close up my notebook. Excellent item, especially for the price. Would definitely recommend.
1	Targus Chill Pad: Other than the powercord on my previous chill pad coming undone due to wear and tear, I've had no other issues with the item.
0	Stopped working after only 2 months of having it: I bought this product on August 6 2007 and today Oct16 2007 it stopped working. I have a Compaq Presario laptop and when I first purchased this item it worked great and then this morning I turned on the laptop and the Chill Pad did not turn on the fans all of sudden stopped working.
0	Don't buy Targus products!!!: I have owned 2 Targus chill mats and they were the worst pieces of crap I ever bought. They last about 2 months before they stop working. Either they will just completely stop working or the fan blades will start tearing off, and then stop working. After about a week they start making a loud sound like something is caught in the fan blades. Unfortunately, they were the only brand available in my local stores, so I had to settle. I will never trust Targus for any product ever again!!! Sure, they offer a warranty, but to be honest, I'm not going to keep my receipt and warranty information in order to get them to replace the junk they sold to me with another piece of junk that will stop working in the same amount of time and charge me over half of what I paid for the product for shipping.
0	Wobbly: Bought one of these a few years ago and really like it. Needed a second one, but when it arrived I discovered a manufacturing error - the rear bottom pads were the same ones as on the front; they are supposed to be thicker than the front ones, so as to slightly elevate the rear so it doesn't wobble on the center screw. You can even see it in the photos on amazon.com So with the same pads front and rear, the pad is worthless as it doesn't sit level, it sits on the center screw and wobbles!Tried getting the correct pads directly from Targus, they said to return it to the vendor. Amazon was nice enough to quickly send a replacement -- with the same problem.Two tries is enough for me, off to Best Buy instead...
0	bad connection soon after purchase: The design for this is terrible. The end of the USB cord going to the pad sticks out at least an inch, so it's really easy to bump it if you use your laptop on your lap. A few bumps and the connection inside the pad becomes faulty. If you try to keep using the pad, you have to move the cord around to find "sweet spots" so that the pad gets its power. This is very annoying, and there doesn't seem to be any simple way to fix it.
0	Didn't know it was so noisy.: It does a good job cooling down the laptop but I use it sparingly because it's so noisy. I don't know what its dB rating is but it's certainly not like a typical PC fan. It's like five times louder than a typical PC fan. If there's a different chill pad that's quieter, I'd get one.
1	Cool Air From the Chill Pad: I've got two dual core laptops at home that I remotely run virtual images on and they tend to get rather hot with the lids closed. Putting a Chill Pad under each laptop keeps both of them much cooler. I don't hear the internal fan in the laptops firing up anywhere near as much. I did have to turn the Chill Pad sideways for one of the laptops to align the fan vents with the laptop heat vents but it works fine in that configuration. If I pick the laptop up and put it back on the Chill Pad the fan inside may start to spin off balance. You have to turn it off and then spin it back up. Overall a great deal for heat venting needs.
0	Horrible!: I orderd this chill pad in May. Didn't actually open and use it until the end of August. it has abruptly stopped working as of last night! Piece of garbage..........
1	useful product: Pros:-raises laptop screen to a more comfortable level-angle of keyboard make typing easier-keeps computer off of wood desk, no more marks on wood-provides for good ventilationCons:-requires attention to placing laptop correctly so it's not wobbly (only an issue if, like me, you are taking your laptop off the stand every day)
0	worked for a week: it worked ok for about a week maybe two then became unreliable. I have yet to find a chill pad that works well. I would not recommend spending your money on this one unless you consider your money extremely disposable
0	bad connection: I own two of these laptop coolers. Bought at the same time and used with two different laptops. Both have the same problem. After about one month of use, the socket on the cooling pad works loose, so the device no longer receives power and the fans stop working. The fans do an excellent job of cooling both laptop and lap until the hardware fails.If I could figure out how to crack the case, I might try to repair these devices. Instead, I'm shopping for another brand with better construction.
0	OKay but not long lasting and loud: I purchased this from Staples a few months back. It worked okay, but one of the fans constantly stopped working or made a horrible sound. It just stoppd working tonight.
0	Power Cord issues after a few months: This fan was easy to setup and use. It did a great job cooling off my Thinkpad T60p. But, after only a few months of fairly normal usage (no drops/excessive wear/etc) the power cord connection went bad - I even tried taping it into place to hold it in better, but it didn't work for long.Also, the plastic fins on the fan can get bent - not sure how, but they do. And then they catch, making that fan not work (there are 2). I've gone in and fixed it - mostly by removing the bent fin.
0	WORST COOLING PRODUCTS EVER!!: I bought this item originally from Wal-Mart. This is my FOURTH one in a little over a year. Every one I have had has died within 4 months. So I just kept either exchanging it for a new one, or buy a new one and return the broken one. Then it looked like Targus redesigned the PA248U because even though the model number was the same, they changed the casing completely and added an on/off button. I decided to give them the benefit of the doubt, so I got it. It was improved. Now it doesn't die outright. The fans will just stall out until you move the mat around and angle it up until the fans will restart. And to get warranty service, you have to pay to ship it back to them. But it costs over half as much to do that as it does to buy a brand new unit.
0	actual product model delivered is not of the pictured shown on amazon: I received a targus chill pad that was different from the one being shown by the seller. seller needs to update the image. chill mate cools the laptop but it is noisy. the fan noise can become annoying over time. I would not recommend this model.
0	The USB cable is a piece of crap: The pad cools better than nothing, but the chord that connects to your laptop is terrible. I've gone through at least 4 of them over the last year. Consistently the part of the cable that connects from the cool pad to the on/off switch has a break in it. All I do is wrap up the cable, put it in my bag, and otherwise use the device on my lap. I'm not sure how to limit its exposure much more. Only good thing is Targus will replace the cable for you, but it takes a few weeks to receive.Also, the rubber nubs that hold the laptop in place are often lost with no replacements readily available. I'm looking for a better product at this time...
0	Cheap quality: Mine did help keep my Dell Inspiron 8500 from getting too hot, but the USB cable leaves a lot to be desired. About a month after getting mine, the fans stopped working. I found the problem to be in the silly on/off switch they stuck in the middle of the cable. I removed the switch and spliced the cable. However, now, approximately six months after I bought the unit, it appears that a wire has broken near the USB plug, and as far as I know, replacement USB plugs aren't available. I guess now it's buy a 5V AC adaptor and wire into the thing. Needless to say, I'm not impressed.
0	better than nothing@: This device is an addition to the fan inside the notebook. However, by itself[;'vfv]\ it did little to cool the laptop down.
0	POS - and that does not mean point of sale!!: This product if ordered should just go straight to trash can. Fans are in the center, which does absolutely nothing for my computer. Second, the fans are small, so no air is circulated by these things. Worst fan I have ever purchased....Finally purchased a large single fan that works and works well. Stay Away from this Piece of $***. You figure it out.
0	Decent while it lasts: The pad ran quietly, but 2 years later it is missing 5 of the foot pads and the fans no longer run. For something with hardly anything to it, that's sad.
0	Great for first 3 months....then quit working.: This was a great cooler out of the box, it is silent and cooled nicely. However, it's cheaply made. The power cords are very cheap, and the cooler itself is flemsy plastic. The pictures make it look much more substantial than it actually is. Our quit working after about 3 months. Targus makes a "new & improved" version. We tried it as well. Much better made, but it was noisey (so noisey it gave me a headache). So we opted for another brand and much happier.
0	Plastic and cheap: I received a different chill pad than the one pictured. It is a very undurable plastic, and one of the fans is already making noise after 3 weeks. It does not cool well on a flat surface such as a desk, so the only useful purpose is if you have it on your lap. You get what you pay for I suppose, but I would not suggest it if you have te extra $20.
0	Didnt get the one in the main picture!!!!: Like the previous reviewer I too did not get the one that is in the main picture. I should have got one that has curves/contours on the sides but this one i got is perfectly rectangle. Plus get this the packaging that came with the one they sent doesnt even look like the one they sent. The packaging and instructions looks like the one in the main picture here. Plus the one I should have got has vents on the side. The one i got does not. So beware when u order this. U wont get the item that is in the main picture. Seems like a much inferior replacement they sent instead. Not happy!
0	Not what it seems: This product is not as show or described. It looks like a replacement for the Targus Chill Pad that goes into a lap-stand. The model shown is a great Chill Pad that has high speed fans and fits into the Targus stands. However this model is super thin is low speed fans. There is also no room to vent the heat out the sides or top or allow cool air to be blown by the fans. The fans also began to freeze up after a week of use. I ordered two and regret it. Don't let the fake picture fool you, this is a low model of Chill Pad and is poorly designed. There are much better models out there, such as the actual one pictured.
1	good book: Good information in the book, but the more I read online the more I question if flipping is right for me
0	Disappointing device: I've been using the BT250 for a couple of weeks now. Here's what I've found:1. The belt clip stinks. The device drops off it all the time. It's silly to see a $90 device sabotaged by a15 cent piece of plastic. (It looks stupid, also.)2. The standby time is nowhere near the 240 hours Jabra advertises. I find that it gives me a low power indication after about 24 hours.3. The 250 is awkward to put on your ear, which is a real pain when you're trying to take a call.4. I've found no way to voice dial on my Blackberry 7290 with the 250.5. The distance you can be from your phone is more like10 feet, as opposed to the 30 that Jabra advertises.6. The volume is very loud on the Jabra. I have to turn down the phone or reduce the volume using the buttons on the 250 all the time.I'd recommend the Motorola HS810 which has a good carrying case, voice dials on the 7290 with no problems, goes on more easily, and has more intelligently designed buttons.
0	FreeSpeak 250 - Not That Great: I was really looking forward to the Bluetooth Wireless experience; however, the Jabra FreeSpeak BT250 is not all that great. With regular usage for three months with my Sony Ericsson T637, I found: a very short battery life, mediocre reception, and a shorter roaming range from my phone {suppose to be able to move 30 feet away from your phone, I couldn't get it to work beyond 7 feet}. Additionally, people would often tell me that they heard excessive static in the background and that it was hard to hear me.This technology could be great, but its a little overrated right now with the cell phone accessories that are currently available. I have had good luck with previous Jabra products and this one, the FreeSpeak, is just disappointing. Maybe I will try this again in a few years. For now, it's back to the "wired" headset.
1	best purchase: I purchased this camera just before a trip to New Zealand. I had two requirements wide angle and macro. This camera more than delivers. It was very easy to learn. The battery life was good I used a battery a day. I purchased a back up battery. I took over 2000 pictures. Thus the back up charged battery. The camera took awesome photos the zoom was a major bonus that I was not really after. Overall I highly recommend this camera and Amazon has the best price going. There are some bad pictures posted on here that I feel do not represent this camera. A camera is as good as the person pushing the button. I have never taken a class and I find this camera user friendly. You judge I have posted pics.
1	Very good camera.: I have used this camera for two vacations and many back yard pictures and am quite impressed with it's capabilities! It was a little hard to get used to because it has more complicated settings than our previous Kodak digital camera, but I do love the10-power zoom and high quality images! The10-power zoom is especially helpful in capturing wildlife shots that will amaze your friends!
0	Panasonic Lumix: While the LCD image is clear and sharp in good light, it is distored in low light and at distances. What good is an ultrazoom lens if you can't see what you are shooting?
0	Lacks quality great concept!: Im a photographer. I compared this head to head with My Canon S70. The S70 quality of pictures far exceeded this camera. After working with other photographers and Panasonic I have determined It can NOT take a very high quality picture even in perfect situations. It only takes pix with 72 DPI vs180 DPI with my Canon. The highest MB image it will take is 3.51. My canon will take averate 2.5 to 3.5 and will do 4.5-5.5 often. WHY is this important. Well if you blow this picture up to say 5x7 or larter you will notice SIGNIFICANT grain and distortion. It was sad. I took pix in all lights and even focused on ASA100 and used a tripod. Im sending it back, Its not worth keeping for anyone who wants to blow up or appreciate a good picture. Panasonic even stated its a beginners camera. So my 5 year old technology in my Canon 7m camera Blows this Brand new camera out of the water.
0	After1 month pump does not work.: The pump does not work after1 month of intermitent use. The gasket in the bottom was installed wrong and water got up into the motor. The motor is now locked up. Pump area is fine, but shaft will not turn without a socket and ratchet. Usually get 2 years out of a pump.
1	This is a wonderful book: When I opened the package I was surprised that this book was so big. I was expecting something a lot smaller. Then when I started reading I was surprised that it held my attention as long as it did. Some of the items take up a page or two, and some only take up a paragraph or two. They say my mind jumps around a lot and that is what this book does, it jumps around a lot and for me it is interesting reading and it holds my attention when few books are able to do that. At the price these books are selling for used right now you can't go wrong on this one.
1	Very, very impressed: I listend to this Paganini rapsody many years ago and was totally overwhelmed. After that I bought ,seperatly, and listend the rest of them. I must say that their interpretation are excellent and very deep, especially the neat structure construted here are very, very impressed. Many other versions perform Rachmanninof with too much feeling, but here it is just enough. Highly recommended.
1	Golly.: Showy and theatrical makes women swoon and men's chests swell lush breathless passionate no-holds-barred romance more powerful than any film soundtrack. Above the keyboard, bangs flopping sweat spraying and whiplash over the keys. Plato's Idea of Piano.
0	Perfect in the beginning, Nightmare in the end.: I was a big fan of this scanner until recently.Opticbook scans books fast without damaging spines.I used it very carefully.I used another scanner of mine for non-book materials, because I didn't want to waste the lamp life.The result? The lamp died after around 200 scans!I used it intermittently, so I was out of warranty when the lamp died.I've used scanners of several manufacturers, and this is the first time that a scanner lamp died on me.In sum, $300 for 200 scans is not recommendable at all.Added: I got another reason to hate this scanner. Service of the company is horrible. I sent several emails about my problem, but never got answers.
1	power washer: For the home owner it does what ever you need at1750 psi. My last one was gas @ 2500psi. This electric washer is a no brainer. Easy operation and at1750 psi can still do damage to wood if not carful.
0	Really inappropriate: I don't like this film and because of it, it gave me a different perspective of the original as an immature movie.It's great for adults but anyone under17 don't watch it i guarntee you thatI am13 years old, so pretty please with a cherry on top, recommend my review PLEEEEEEEEEEASE or else!
0	Sex and nudity in the city of gambling: This movie is about a woman who goes to Las Vegas to try gambling but instead becomes a prostitute.If the nudity could be removed I believe this could be an exciting thriller about gambling. Instead it is really just like a silly soap opera with lots of nudity.Because of the large amount of nudity in this film I wouldn't recommend it for children or women.
1	Elizabeth Berkley is a babe!: Having been a fan of Elizabeth Berkley long before this movie was made,was thrilled to learn she got the lead. I really dig watching Liz in this movie, she is beautiful as always and does not let anyone push her around. Just watching her hitchhike at the end and beginning of the movie is enough to make any man smile, I just wish I could have been the driver picking her up! Great movie, here's to hoping Elizabeth will star in the much needed sequel Showgirls 2. Recently I saw her starring in the movie Student Seduction, Elizabeth Berkley is easily one of the most beautiful and talented actresses today, she is in the same league as beauties like Angelina Jolie, Julia Roberts, Ashley Judd, and Hilary Swank.
1	A big slice of cheesecake: Elizabeth Berkley stars as a hooker who wants to be a Las Vegas showgirl...only to find out it's not as glamourous as she anticipated. All I can say is, they certainly saved money on the wardrobe....Elizabeth Berkley spends over 50% of the movie naked.
1	hey hey hey what is going on here?: first of all laugh all you want but i actually thought that this movie wasn't all that bad.i do think that gina gershon played her part really well.i also think she could have played elizabeth berkley's role too.i thought the movie was way better than striptease.i've seen both the r-rated and nc-17 versions and i saw no difference.i also didn't see much reason to rate it nc-17 either.the funny thing was i was sitting there thinking to myself,you know mr.belding and screach got to work with liz all through her teen years and they probally saw this movie.hell they probally own it!!!!-jason zabka
1	Highly Underrated, The Plan 9 From Outer Space Of Our Time: Showgirls, by Paul Verhoeven, is definatly the sleaziest movie ever made. But is is also really underrated. Showgirls is basicly a American Dream movie, about a girl who goes to a town to make it big. Showgirls is filled of nudity, but not very much hardcore sex. If you wanna see a so bad it is good movie, see this one.
0	TRASHY: Over hyped! Not even good photography. Would not recommend it. Don't waste your money. Try to find some other film.
0	This is by Thrustmaster!?: Totally disappointing. The dead space is unbelievably large and the 8-directional button keeps misinterpreting input strokes. Can't believe this junk has the Thrustmaster name on it. The wheel is cheap plastic construction and has a very flimsy feeling. Don't waste your time and money on this one.
0	Arcade OK, but simply not up to standards for simulations!: Here we go!! just got myself a XBox, F1 2002, and this steering wheel...My conclusion is simple and dreadfull... it's just doesn't give me accurate control over my car!! The deadspot in the center is just to big, and the forcefeedback get's a 2 out of10. The experience with my PC and wheel is better!! and thats not the reason for me to run to the shop...But ok, as an objective reviewer i can give it 2 stars as it is useable in arcade like games.
1	Good But with a few flaws: This wheel is really good. The only major flaws are that when you change racing games you may need to change the sensitivity of the wheel. I was really looking foward to having a realistic gear shifter but it only shifts up and down which makes it good for the games like cell damage but not so realistic for games like project gotham racing. The foot pedals are great and i recomend you get this game wheel.
1	A Tragic story: As one of the characters in the book, I am grateful to Andrew Schneider and David McCumber for portraying what has happened to Libby, Montana and its residents so thoughtfully and thoroughly.The book is a "must read" for everyone.The story is far from over in Libby and around the country, but if what has occured in Libby serves as a lesson to other communities, it will be worth it.People can make a difference, if they don't give up and are surrounded by people that believe in them.
1	A True Account of Lethal Deception for Profit: The author Andrew Schneider tells the story of uncovering a scandal of major proportions. It is a frightening, chilling story of hidden dangers allowed by government officials whose jobs are to keep us safe. It is the story of a mineral still used in our country whose lethal dangers were recorded by Pliny the Elder. Asbestos cannot be safely used in any manner.
1	Pioneer Families of eastern and southeatern Kentucky: My wife thought this book was a great book of info to help with her research. Wll look to purchase more books on the subject.
1	Unparalled story craftmanship: I have just finished this book. It was a delight. Uncle Remus is one of the most alive characters ever to be portrayed in literature. Now, this is coming from someone who has read Conrad, Doctorow, Carrol, D.H. Lawrence, Robertson Davies, and many other engaging storytellers. Somehow, Uncle Remus resonated with me across the120+ years since it was written. The simple concept of a free slave mentoring a plantation owner's boy by masterful storytelling is pure magic and often heart-warming. For anyone young at heart, this book is a must.
0	Low Quality Filter: The white filter has an inferior quality to the one that came originally with the machine. It broke totally when I tried to wash it first time. That did not happen to the original one even when I washed again and again. I wonder if the replacement is fake.
0	Beware-- shipping ruins these planters.: I bought these planters because I had owned them before and they were very durable and attractive. I especially liked the high-gloss look. Unfortunately, when I received my planters, they had been put in the shipping box with the wadded up, rough craft paper that Amazon so often uses and it ruined the high-gloss finish of the outer planter. The other planters were nested inside and were fine. So when I ordered them in another size, I ordered one extra figuring that they would be packaged the same way despite the fact that I notified Amazon of the problem. Sure enough, same problem, but I was able to return the ruined outer one that I didn't want anyway-- it essentially served as packing.
0	Okay: "Class of Nuke 'em High Part 2" was an okay film, but not a great one. The original was better. When I ordered this, I thought 'Alright, I finally get to see Tromie, the Nuclear Squirrel.' I thought he'd show up at the end, but the makers of this film had to ruin it by showing the end of the film at the beginning. That's why I didn't much care for this one. Also, I didn't like the theme song. All they said was "Class of Nuke 'em High Part 2" over and over again. But I'm glad I only had to pay 5.99 for this movie and not13.99.
0	Easily the worst movie ever!: Blasting in my right eardrum, right now, is the Class of Nuke'em High, Part 2: Subhumanoid Meltdown theme song. Yes it has a theme song, and it does have the title in the lyrics. The hero of this film, apparently, is a hot hunk of man-flesh named Roger, who is smitten with a sub-humanoid, but is unable to get sex because he has B.O. The antagonists are mouths in peoples stomachs. Roger is really hot, and so are most of the bodies, but the mechanical mouths are too sickening to make this film even worthwhile as a bad nudie-flick. The plot makes sense, I mean, why not?
1	Daughter's now part of the airsoft games: My daughter wanted to join the buys playing "bad guys" and this was a good fit. We haven't used any caps but the gun is good quality for the price
1	Neanderthal Man: I gave one to my14 yr. old grandson who has AD/HD. He loves to take things apart and usually keeps me on edge when he comes for a visit. However, this toy kept him and a friend busy and interested for a couple of hours digging out the bones. They had a great time and did well in finding all the bones and putting them together. It was somewhat messy, but easy to clean up afterward.
0	Item is Not as Described!: I ordered two of these pans. One for myself and one for my sister. We DID NOT RECEIVE A STAINLESS PAN! We received an aluminum pan with a non-stick black coating on the interior. The pans we received were from the MC2 collection. Amazon sent me a new pan but I received another MC2 pan. So now I have to return two pans and my sister must return one. We are both collecting the 3-ply All-Clad stainless cookware. I am very dissapointed. Amazon will not honor a comparable sale price on a stainless pan.
0	One of my least favorite Nora books......: Cassidy St. John is out of work and is thrilled by artist Colin Sullivan's offer to pay her for modeling for a portrait. He treats her terribly throughout the whole book and then wants to marry her in the end, because he is haunted by her face. I doubt anyone would fall for such an abusive, domineering man in real life.Excerpt from the back of the book:"Fired from yet another job, Cassidy St. John hardly expected the solution to her difficulties to come looming out of the fog on Fisherman's Wharf. However, the darkly handsome Colin Sullivan seemed the answer to any maiden's prayers.When Colin offered Cassidy a job modeling for one of his paintings, it seemed her troubles were over- but one look at his blue eyes and Cassidy knew they were just beginning. How could she hide from the pitiless honesty of Colin's artistic vision when with every stroke of his brush he exposed her love for him?"
0	Old and Tired: This short story isn't worth the paper it's printed on. I only happended to buy it because of the Golden Gate Bridge on the cover. The book was very weak in plot development, character depth, scene descriptions, etc. Cassidy and Colin - the two romantic leads - could have been developed much more if the book was longer and the writing stronger. I think the publishers are just cashing in on something Roberts penned in high school - the writing is pretty bad. Save yourself the time and money and buy a more recent Roberts book.
0	Dorf: I did not review "Dorf Goes Fishing" however I did See the Complete Dorf Set. I did not find it funny. Even as much as I enjoy the comedy of Tim Conway. Probably would not recommend this title.
0	Not Socrates Cafe.: The Socrates Cafe is a poorly written book. Christopher Phillips was to busy using fancy words to realize that the reader has to spend15 seconds on words just to pronounce them correctly. I like his ideas but he came up short putting them into words! Using fancy language is not always a good thing. The best writing is writing that is clear and precise.
0	Do Not Buy: I wasted money on four packs, every burn has failed. I used about ten before my burner went dead and stoped reading dvds all together, so I had to buy a new burner and they still don't work. You get what you pay for.
0	Waste of money: This makes for a good late night HBO movie when you are bored. Not worth the money spent to own , nor the time spent watching it. IF it was 20 years ago I might have said it was a good movie , but nowadays its just too boring and obvious.
0	A ridiculous waste of paper!: I was grievously disappointed with A MAIDEN'S GRAVE, especially after reading THE BONE COLLECTOR. Certain weak premises are unforgiveable - such as frequent the use of the word "stoat" by numerous characters, including the deaf ones and their interpreters, when a sign-language interpretation of that word would be automatically translated to "weasel". This is Kansas, not England! All the characters are poorly-defined and broadly unsympathetic, except the smallest children who are barely more than props shaken at the reader like helpless puppies. The "suspense" in this book left me feeling dirty and voyeuristic.
1	Even an avid suspense fan won't foresee the surprise ending!: When a busload of deaf girls are kidnapped and forced into an old building by murderous convicts within the first pages of this novel, I felt as if this book was doomed to go downhill. The police have surrounded the building, there is little or no chance for escape,and how can the police hope to coordinate a succesful rescue when they cannot communicate with the hostages?Jeffrey Deaver manages to take what seems like a dead end, and turn it into an entertaining roller coaster ride. We watch as the hostage negotiator dances verbally with the head of the convicts to keep him from killing the hostages and as the eldest hostage uses subtle sign language to calm the others.But just as the seige seems to comes to an end, we learn that surrender isn't always a permanent thing.
0	What is on the tape?: It is hard to know if you want to buy an item when the descriptioin does not include what movies are on the tape?Could someone post that info?I'll rate it higher when I know what it is?Phillip
0	Disappointed: I was really disappointed with the product. It is to thin and the chain turns a dark color after a few wears. I have only had this item for 3 weeks and have had to clean it four (4) times already. Would not recommend it for purchase.
0	Kind of junky: Not really worth $250... "leaves" are just cut from flat sheet-metal, not all the candles are exactly vertical, and the chandelier i received was missing a hook for one of the crystals.
0	Bailamos all the way.: Only the song "Bailamos" can stand the test of time. If you are non-latino (like me), you can safely switch off the CD after the first song. I am thankful to the manufacturers that the best song is the first one. I don't even have to forward the CD beyond the first one to listen to the rest of the songs. It might be attributed to my little knowledge of lingua-latino, but I am not sure. I bought this CD when the latino fever was at a feverish pitch. Ricky Martin, I forgive. Enrique, your album is all greek and latin to me.
1	MARIETH DAVILA.: ENRIQUE TE FELICITO LA CANCION ES MUY BUENA,TIENE BUEN RITMO Y TU VOZ EN INGLES SE OYE MUY BIEN,ME FACINA TODA TU MUSICA, ERES EL MEJOR.
1	Bailamos: Me gusta mucho: Great music! Does anyone have any idea how I can obtain the lyrics to all the songs on Bailamos?
1	Great: I love this song but I would really like to get ahold of the words, can someone send me the words to the songs?
0	The names of this book's reviewers seem fake ...: "Warren Buffet", "Mr. Benson", etc. Give me a break. This author has people going to individual blogs, especially those that are centrist or conservative in origin, and spamming their comments sections with pseudo-testimonials. Seems like a rather pathetic way to sell a Chicken Little, doom-and gloom, progressive, arab-apologist tome by a State Department flunky. As I can see, many would appear to be gobbling up the tripe!
1	A MUST READ FOR EVERY VOTER THIS FALL: CRIMES OF THE RIGHT is a suspenseful near-real thriller set in the world of domestic surveillance, international espionage, Washington , and California Politics. This well-researched thriller demonstrates the events of the past four years in a fictional set-up, to entertain, dazzle, engage, engross, and make you think. If you're tired of reading non-fictions, try this near-real-thriller fiction.
0	sadly, a shoddy work: Arthur Ashe made many fine contributions to America, but this isn't one of them. Not up to the standard set by the other books in the series.
1	NICE,AWSOME,COOL SHOTS.: THE HONG KONG PART WAS AN AWSOME,SUPER DUPER,COOL GODZILLA PART.GODZILA'S STOMACH WAS COOL.HE LOOKED AWSOME AND BETTER THAN EVER.THE BATTLE SCENES ARE AWSOME.THE DESTROYERS PART WITH THE POLICE BATTLE WAS AWSOME.EVEN SUPER X 3.THE PLACE THEY FIGHT AT IS COOL(THE AIRPORT).EVEN LITTLE GODZILLA,HE GREW BIGGER AND WAS COOL LIKE THE FATHER(GODZILLA).GODZILLA DOES DIE IN THE MOVIE BY A MELTDOWN DESEASE.THE END WAS COOL WHEN JUNIOR GETS BIG AND ROARS LIKE GODZILLA.THIS IS MY FAVORITE GODZILLA FILM.I THINK THIS ONE IS BETTER THAN GODZILLA 98.
1	Terrific, Magical, spellbounding,left me speachless: Tells more than enough about the old dragon ways and is the most dramatic and heart warming novel yet. The Great Aurora will rise again. (HOPEFULLY)
0	Many Miles Away..a tribute to The Police: Some things are better left untouched. And this is the case with this cd.Being a professional touring musician this reeks with stink. I can't believe someone would release this to the public. Not a single track on this cd is worth anything.Next time leave it alone...The Police are the masters and you people are still in kindergarten.
1	Tells you what it really means to let go!: This book tells you what it really means to let go and what happens if you truly let go. Many times we think we have let go of something in our heads but we are just in denial. Our heart has not really let go. This book has helped me overcome some of the most painful experiences in my life. If you want to really understand what letting go means, I'd also recommend "The Ever-transcending Spirit" by Toru Sato. After you read this book by Toru, you will feel very free and understand how life is actually quite simple and extremely beautiful.
0	Ok: Not what I expected it to be. More religious than I prefer and definately works with the AA platform which wasn't what I wanted.
1	Life doesn't always go as we want. This might help.: Life does not always go as we want... as we had hoped... dreamt... prayed.This book was written to help people coming out of relationships that were brought to an end... by choice... by accident... by illness... by betrayal by the other... by whatever reason.Regardless, at some certain point, reality has to be accepted, and you need to move on. You can only suffer for so long.This book is both a crutch and a companion. It can be a guide. It is certainly worth the read.
0	The worst proofed book in the universe: This book is by far the worst proofed book I've ever read in my life. I can't believe I'm writing this as a review, because I can normally overlook a few typos. However, the typos in this book make for an almost impossible read. I can't believe I paid money for it.
0	BORING: every teenage girl should watch this before her first datebefore going to makeout lane don't forget yor diaphramgirlfriend
1	Good educational supplement: My 3rd grade special needs child enjoys reading these stories and the reinforcement of the "dot pen" with its lights and noise is a lot of fun for him when he has to work on the reading comprehension questions. The downside is that the stories range from1st to high 5th level (guide marks each story). I would prefer to have a box of stories with less range (maybe just1-2nd then another box of just 3-4) but we're using these and will continue.
0	Cheaper Than It Looks - Cheaper Than It Costs: The product looks nicer online than it does in person. When I opened the box, the stand was intact, but10 of the12 magnets had popped off the back of the cannisters and I had to reglue them myself.There are12 spices included with labels, but it would have been nice if they provided more pre-printed labels for other spices, or at least blank labels you could fill in yourself. Overall I'm pretty disappointed.
0	magnetic spice rack: The idea was a good one but,....... the tins fall off the metal base not enough mag in the magnet and they have been rolling all over my kitchen and it's big and bulky and no place to put it, a little too big for my counters. No where to hang either.
1	My son loves this hat!: My son got it in his head that he had to have a "Coolie" Asian style hat to keep cool. He's11 years old, so kind of odd for his age. I convinced him to buy this Chillba hat instead of the traditional straw woven hat. I was afraid the straw would fall apart too soon for the asking prices. I figured if his interest passed then at least I could wear it for gardening! It is cooler than hats that rest directly on your head and works very well keeping the sun out of eyes and has a wide brim for shade. I felt it was worth the money since it is washable and a nice sturdy cloth material.
1	Beautiful and Practical: This is a beautiful, practical (or should I say, practical, beautiful) piece. It is called a "Casserole for Two" but that would be two that are very hungry. I use it mainly for soups. It goes from cooktop to tabletop perfectly. When I do use it in the oven for a casserole, the same is true. It is a beautiful serving dish. The pan cleans easily. I cook for two (sometimes three or four)and use the "Casserole for Two" frequently and love it. Jo
1	I'll Be Watching You: I loved this book...it kept you guessing right up to the end. Very fast paced and exciting. I have really enjoyed all of Andrea Kane's books. You get involved with the story and almost feel like you're there. I hope she keeps writing a lot more.
1	Absolutely essential to your collection!: I used to have this recording on vynal. I got rid of it when I converted to CD's only. Needless to say I did not hesitate to spend the $25.00 to have it again but on CD. VERY good listening. Some of my closest friends were skeptical, we're not big Boz Scaggs fans, however, once they heard it they quickly changed thier minds. This recording is not quite the same as a1980/90's Boz recording. It's heavier on the blues side with nice horns and guitar. A real must have.
1	Very good value and performance!: This center channel speaker has a very crafted high quality appearance. I took the grill off and was impressed by the speakers themselves. I never realized how important a center channel speaker really is. I invested most of my money in the front and surround. I hooked this speaker up and it really filled the void you feel when there is not much activity from the other speakers when you hear dialog from movies. I thought they had good high and mid range. The voices and other center channel output sounded rich and strong. The 61/2 inch woofers are better than I thought they would be based on some other reviews I read.
0	?????This Game is confusing and stupid?????: This game is confusing and stupid!! It is hard to find out what each butten means but please use your money wisely and dont get this game!!!!! Get Roller Coaster Tycoon or The Sims.
1	Great Game: This game is a great game! You learn about the economy as well as build what some people think is great. It is true that the tutorial does not finish but this still is a great game. I highly recommend this game
1	I would give it five, but...: I really like the availability of a calcium/magnesium supplement in powder form. And I am sure KAL does a fine job in quality testing. I give it four stars only because you must be very careful with the dosage. I used their recommendation for a few weeks and wound up missing several days of work with terrible diarhea. After taking several weeks away, I started again with half the dosage, and have had no problems.I recommend taking this conjunction with a good vitamin D3/K2 supplement.
0	Not worth my time: Despite its colorful vocabulary, The Blood Countess has no merit in terms of content. The author simply describes the perverted, without having a pertinent message. If you enjoy reading about disgusting fantasies, then, by all means, read this book. But, if you are seeking a book that is more historically focused, look elsewhere.
1	Great for different types of beds: I have a weird shaped bed that means I can't use most bed skirts so this was great. It wraps around my bed frame perfectly and looks very nice. The only problem is, that on my metal posts it keeps riding down/doesn't stay up. So you have to pull them up once you make the bed. But I am not sure if there is really anything that could be done about that with the type of bed I have so I am pretty happy with this product.
0	DUST RUFFLE: Nice material. Well made but way way too short unless your looking for a10 inch drop don't bother. Way way too short...also can't return because Brown's Linens enclosed a letter that said10% re-stocking fee, no shipping cost to be refunded and if item was sent with free shipping, the amount they paid to ship to me will be deducted. Not worth spending more money to send it back to them with all the deductions I would end up owing them even more money...Oh well, maybe someone else could use it, I'll put it in my garage sale item pile.
1	The dark side of the river is revealed.: Keepers was hard to put down. I read it in two days. It held my attention and I remained curious throughout the book as to where we were going. What did all these people have in common?The book was well written. The setting was perfect for the story. I have been to the bluffs, the mounds, the islands and caves of the river. The author did a nice job of taking me from nostalgia all the way to the occult. I loved the mystery and dark secrets of the river.Schulz has a bit of Stephen King lurking about. Are his "keepers" of the same breed as Kings "low men"?If you have been to the river read the book.
0	Needs better editing- mistakes found: The judges for our trivia contest used this book as the arbiter for disputed questions tonight, and the NYT Almanac was wrong or incomplete on two questions, verified by multiple sources. Number one, The place Lee surrendered to Grant was not a "Courthouse" in Appomatox, Va.... rather, It was a farm in the *town* of "Appomatox Courthouse", VA. A quick Google search will confirm this on dozens of sources.The question the Almanac was incomplete on, was about the Definition of "DVD". Properly and technically known as Digital Versatile Disk, the NYT Almanac only metion only a colloquial "Digital Video Disk", which is common, but not accurate. A DVD can contain video, but not all DVD's contain video.I wonder how many more mistakes there are in this book? Yeah, I'm a sore loser, but right is right and wrong is wrong. Maybe the Almanac makes up stuff too?
0	Give me a break!: Kiss have more compliation albums than I have had hot dinners. This is just a rehash of other compliation albums. Nothing new here. Double Platinum is far better
0	Kiss it Off: If you're a die hard Kiss fan, you probably already have all these songs, so don't bother with the CD. If you're not, don't bother with this CD. It's full of rather unimaginative, derivative 70's rock, absent the spectacle of their stage performances. If you like Kiss & don't have many of their CDs, then get this one ... it'll do until you can afford the others.Personally, I'd go for concert footage in surround sound, or even music videos. This CD experience was flat, a disappointment. Perhaps I've just grown up too much since the 70's and need to trip back to my youth. Even so, for this genre, I'd prefer Def Leppard--more verve, more creativity, more driving power. More interesting.But choose your own poison ... how you want to blow your hearing is none of my business. This CD just doesn't rate high enough for me to risk tinnitus for it!
0	POOR SOUND: I HAVE ALREADY SENT THE T.V. BACK TO TOSHIBA TO HAVE THE VOLUMN REPAIRED, THE T.V IS IN THE KITCHEN AND YOU CANNOT HEAR IT AT MAX. VOLUMN 5 FEET AWAY. AFTER BEING REPAIRED?????, ITS NO BETTER
0	Not all that great...: I finished this in one day. It is that easy a read. Its got a virtually non-existant plot. The characters are also rather flat and unrealistic. It does try to have some humour here and there, but that's about it. It's not worth the time spent reading it, unless you happen to be doing a book report on something sucky. After I read this, I doubt I'll go watch the movie, even though the movie has a great cast. Overall, a disappointment.
1	Gift of the Red Bird: Very inspirational. I was totally filled with the Holy Spirit. I think I would like to go on a retreat like that. We have so much to learn. Please try it.
1	Cristo Vive: ...Y viene por una iglesia sin mancha y sin arruga. Preparémonos mas y más, el que esté preparado, sirva aún más, y el que esté en el proceso, ¡Clame, clame, congemidos indecibles! ...para que Nuestro Señor Jesucristo fortalezca nuestros lomos y así continuar este camino de guerra yendo de victoria en victoria y de poder en poder, con Cristo: ¡Llegaremos...!
1	Right Place, Right Time: I came to this book from the perspective of someone getting its brand ready to take its first tentative steps overseas. Anholt has provided a vital resource for anyone wishing to do the same, especially in these times of overnight global dotcoms.Heartily recommended.
1	Another Great Novel by Peter David: Great story, Peter David has really created a great new series for star trek fans, although there seems to be a long wait between the novels. The charactors are great and a nice change from the tv series as David can do what he wants with them as they are his creation. He takes them to the stars and back and almost always weaves a great plot. love Calhoun and Shelby!! 5 Stars David
0	Disappointed: I just received these a few minutes ago and was very excited to try them. I tried to put them on 2 different pairs of my daughters shoes and they do not fit. My daughter is 5 and wears a size12-13 shoe. The package says 4+ but I think it should say 4 and under. Also one of them is flawed from being stretched over the insert that was in it. I guess I will see about returning.
0	Ruby Slippers Shoe Covers: I was very unhappy with my purchase! I wanted to give the reviews the benefit of the doubt; I should have went with the majority! My two granddaughters and I had a Oz paarty and the shoe covers were off within the first15 minutes! I agree with the shopper who said to save your money and invest in your little girl a nice pair of red shoes that she will get to wear for more than just a few minutes! Not worth the money! :(
0	Cute but Not durable: The shoe covers were different sizes and did not stay in place. The bows came off some shoes prior to the tots going on stage. As they began to dance the shoe cover came off. They are cute but good for dress up only.
0	Formulative: That's actually more of a 2.5 than a 2, but compared to XTC's later work, or even their next album, it's really mediocre. "Statue Of Liberty" and "Radios In Motion" are excellent songs, as are "Science Friction" and "She's So Square," both included as bonus tracks, but there isn't much else to grab hold on here. Most of it's just generic quirk-pop (especially Colin Moulding's songs) and there's an endless, almost melodiless cover of "All Along The Watchtower" included as well. I'm not gonna say "But it's better than 90% of recordings today! " like all other fans because it's not. But the band got better really, REALLY quickly after this one-- they just hadn't pulled themselves together yet.
1	human growth master mind group: This collection of works by the various authors offers the listener an opportunity to have an easily accessed master mind group in the field of human growth. The morning commute's blahs are a thing of the past when the driver plugs in a tape or cd and visits with the likes of Jack Canfield, Marianne Williams and the others. Each offers a conversational monologue which address basic human perceptions and attitudes. Whether at home or on the road, each tape is a treasure of information which offers the listener tools to reshape basic views of life. These tapes are well worth the value. They are like good traveling companions. You welcome their presence, and delight in their gifts. I strongly recommend it to anyone.
1	I just love it.: I just love this cd.I like every one of the songs but, "party with me tonight" is my favorite. If you like blues it's the one to buy.
1	sultry...blissful...awesome: I've been a long time fan of Mazzy Star, but this album surpasses what Hope Sandoval did with Mazzy. Has the same feel but more sublime and matured. Her vocal skills seem to be sharpened a bit also. Not that she gets operatic or anything, but reveals slight nuances of purring and tonal hooks. It took me a couple listens to get this perspective, but my ears finally came around. For any fan of Hope Sandovals previous efforts, you will not be disappointed at all. I can't wait for her next release!
0	Useless don't waste your money: No material of substance. Don't waste your time or money. Look somewhere else. "The Idea Hunter" by Andy Boynton is a better book.
0	O'really..: The contents' probably great, but what happened to the cover of the book? Did Young & Bernbach over-squeezed their "creativities" and left the cover of this book out cold? Wake up guys...bright yellow is a definite NO-NO for a book cover...leave the "neons" for Las Vegas...!!
0	VERY MISLEADING!!!!: I just ordered this item and no where does it state that the dvd is missing it specifically notes that it is a blu ray & dvd combo pack as well as on the front it has where it said "blu ray +dvd" the +dvd is taken out. It should just say Blu ray since i got this so my daughter is able to watch it in our car as well in the house...which now i cannot, the movie is great but the fact that the title is misleading and im not getting all thats in it is upsetting.
0	Some inappropriate moments for family viewing: There are a few inappropriate scenes in the film, for instance a very busty gnome girl calling out the rules of a race in a racy manner and wearing a blouse with a lot of cleavage. Other scenes with a male gnome in a very tiny spandex outfit that is meant to be funny but seemed a bit obnoxious in reality. We were a bit uncomfortable at times watching this with the kids. I don't recommend it for kids under13, and if you're much older than13 I have difficulty in seeing how you can like this film. My wife and I both couldn't wait for it to be over!
1	Adorable movie you'll be surprised how much you love!: I was pleasantly surprised watching this movie with my kids and husband. It was adorable! And it was updated, kid friendly, and used in-jokes to keep it Shakespearean! Not to mention that Patrick Stewart played a statue of William Shakespeare talking to Gnomeo (James McAvoy), when both played Professor X, one as the young version, one as the old...Plus, it as just feel goody, happy, and used mostly Elton John music for the musical numbers instead of made up sugary tunes, which just made it more funny. It was great! (And my kids loved it too, LOL.)
0	Horrible movie!: Did not follow the Romeo and Juliet story. Was a waste of my time! Don't waste your time with this movie!!!
1	Gnomep & Juliet was GREAT!!: The movies arrived promptly and was in great working condition!!! The movie was very funny and I cried at the end.
1	Volume 3: It's good to see the characters in a different setting. Rowan Atkisson plays a very different part in each of the four seasons. Great take on how to develop a series.
1	Brilliant Rowan Atkinson: I positively LOVE British comedy... Benny Hill, Fawlty Towers, `Allo `Allo, Mr. Bean, Monty Python, Mind Your Language etc. The best of these is Black Adder.Black Adder turns history upside down on its head. Forget whatever you learnt of the Tudors because you will have to re-learn it when you watch the "real history" of Black Adder.For those who are unfamiliar with this series, it may take you a while to understand the nuances and "read between the lines". But this ability to understand the humor will increase as you watch the series. A general underlying truth is that each episode gets funnier as you move forward in this series.Rowan Atkinson is positively brilliant! Honestly speaking, I think that his performance in this series is just head and shoulders above his comedy in Mr. Bean.
1	where did it go: i know this album had the bonus-cut "its a man's pride" or "man's pride" where can i find it? that song should be in his top five
0	Driller Killer: How horrible! I waited years to see this (it's only now allowed to be seen in Britain again) and was so dissapointed. Let's face it..Abel Ferrara movies are crap..he's probably the most over-rated independent director around and Bad Lieutenant his most over-rated movie. The only films of his worth seeing are Ms 45 and Dangerous Games (only because it's the only film ever that Madonna acts well in). Budget restrictions aside, this is still grimy, cheap exploitation (nothing wrong with that) that tries to pass itself off as 'art'. Watch it once but don't add to your collection.
0	Moto-X: Lets see I really dont like the game at all, it gets boring quick its just not one of THQs good games.The gameplay is ok but thats about it.
1	Great reference: I have a 30 year old version of this book that my mother used in college. If you want to know how to integrate any weird function, look in here. The best table of integrals i've ever seen, and lots of helpful formulas and references. A terrific reference. I have used this book for virtually all my classes as an Electrical Engineering major.
0	Huge pills impossible to swallow: I have never had trouble swallowing pills. I can even swallow 4 normal sized pills at a time. But I can't even swallow one of these pills they are so huge. They don't even fit in a pill cutter! It is incredibly painful when one gets stuck in my throat. My swallowing muscle contracts around it and it is awful. I even tried cutting one in half, but it is so fat that it still gets stuck. I tried coating one in butter, and that didn't work either. They are going in the trash.
0	I didn't receive the product ....: I bought the product but I didn't receive the product. The vendor service was bad.
0	William J. Hennessey's Modern Furnishings for the Home: Not a bad book and it might be just what you're looking for. 300 pages, all b&w, picture quality is only fair. I guess this book belongs in a quality library but I found it generally disappointing at the price.
1	Jimmie Johnson Cooler: This cooler goes everywhere with me. It has a great design with a front pocket. It is large enough to fit several smaller glad wear containers or 6 cans of soda.
0	Not the same color as on the detail page!: So disappointed and will be returning this. The color of the product on the detail page is an elegant dark-grey with a smattering of green, but the actual product itself is very green and drab looking. I've attached an actual photo. Is it sage? I suppose. Is it dark? No. Is it anything like the product photo? Not at all.
1	A Glowing reiview of a classic band.: This album typifies the sound of the late 70's post-punk scene in England. The sound is tight, fast, and very energetic. The first song (Meccanic Dancing) is driven by a angular guitar riff and classic hiccup style vocals by Partridge. Very fun indeed. Of course like most albums there are a few duds but still fun. My fave tracks are Jumping in Gomorrah (because it puts religous zealots in place), Red, and I am the Audience which is an electrifying New wave/punk stomper.As well listening to Go 2 you can hear where many current bands (Blur, Bis, and even Green Day) pick up their snotty yet propulsive sound. A great album which will keep you on your feet dancing or bopping.
0	The best worse zombie movie of recent memory..: Even the most desperate of zombie fans will find this absurd. I mean jeez, a young girl living in the woods with her zombie parents? No, this isn't a comedy. A journalist runs into a local man in a town that she seeks a story. He tells two bogus tales of terror. A man does exercise for15 minutes in the first story. BORING. The sound, editing, acting, and over all product is BAD. I am a big fan of gore and bloody zombie effects. This had nothing to offer me. I doubt you'll find anyhing for yourself either.
1	Useful: My wife and I are planning a trip to Tuscany in May 2007, and ordered this video to get ideas about off-the-beaten-track places to go. The video is beautifully shot, well-narrated and contains useful information. On the negative side, though, its a bit thin on detail and far too short in running time. It left us wanting more, but certainly excited about our upcoming trip. In that sense, I suppose it was worth the money.
1	Tripp Lite TMC: The item is well made. It has an easy to understand hook-up and operation. I would recommend it to friends.
0	Was sent a used item: The item I was sent arrived in an open box and appears to have been used previously. There are scratches along the sides, especially near the outlets.
0	Good-looking but poor performance: We bought the Crosley Songwriter in October of last year at Linens 'n Things.The remote didn't work, but Customer Service at Crosley sent a new one, which worked fine.As a fourth-grade teacher, I have many cassettes that I want to record onto CDs (stories from the reading series, old books-on-tape), so I used it to copy these over. All seven of the CDs I made worked wonderfully. Transferring albums was equally easy, although I only did one. In both cases, the most difficult part was being present to press the button that manually splits tracks.After a month of use, however, the CD player would only play part of a CD--three songs--and then it would quit, locking up the unit. Powering off and back on freed up the unit, but didn't solve the problem. We have since returned the Songwriter to Linens 'n Things for a full refund. This is a great idea in an attractive package that just doesn't work.
0	Great idea, poor performance: It worked great at first, then the turntable started playing slow. Same thing for the cassette player. It worked great the first time. Now it is all muffled, if it plays at all. Sometimes when you try to record the machine shuts off. I whole heartedly do NOT recommend this item.
0	Expensive Piece Of Junk!!: I was actually able to convert some vinyl to digital, but not to the quality that I expected from this Crosley 248. After a few weeks the CD changer refused to open. I can assure you that if you cannot open the CD changer, the machine is worthless. Don't waste your money! I would have given this ZERO stars, but had to settle for one star instead!
0	crosley crap: I was very disappointed with my purchase.the record player doesnt play very clear. and the tapes were clear,then the tape player wasnt eatting them. I would not recommend spending all that $$ for something i think is not that good.
0	Junk-Save Your Money: This player was a Christmas gift that was opened Christmas morning. The player had a bunch of screws or something rolling around inside the sealed player when we took it out of the box. There was a larger component rolling around inside the player also. Must have been where the screws came from. We still tried out the player hoping that we would not have an electrical blow-out when we plugged it in because of the components rolling around inside the player. It seemed to work ok. We returned it for a full refund.This item was very cheaply made and for the money they are asking for it it is not worth it. Do not go by the pictures because the one I received did not look like the same wood color. And thats because it is not real wood.I am not sure where this was made but it is typical of the junk that is being made in China these days. When I was a kid this kind of junk was being made in Japan.My advice...stay away.
0	Crosley recoreders are junk "DO NOT BUY THEM": I bought the Crosley recorder last year at Christmas and used it (3) times and the cassette player quit working...sent it back for a new one and then the power button would not work....just got a new one again for the third time and now this power button doesn't work you have to use the remote control only to use it....junk,junk,junk!!!!!!!! Never again will I purchase one of these and they should pull them all off the market since they are getting such bad reviews and everyone has problems with them......
0	CROSLEY CR248 SONGWRITER CD RECORDER: THIS MACHINE SEEMS TO WORK O.K. , BUT THE SUPPORT FROM THE MFG. STINKS. THEY CHARGE 9.95 FOR12 PLASTIC 45 INSERTS THAT YOU CAN PURCHASE 60 FOR $7.00 ON E-BAY. THEY OFFER A BRUSH AND REPLACEMENT NEEDLES FOR OTHER MACHINES, BUT NOT FOR THIS MODEL. THE SUPPORT IS VERY IMPORTANT WHEN YOU ARE PAYING SUCH A PRICE. SOMEONE NEEDS TO NOTIFY THEM OF THIS FACT.LEN SCHIFF
1	Very funny movie: This movie was great it was hysterically funny and is no more tasteless and vulgar than low brow movies that have come out since this, movies that make this movie look pretty tame! I don't like movies that I feel cross the line from funny low brow to being too offensive, and while there was one thing I didn't care for in the movie the majority of it was fine but I didn't feel this movie crossed the line and I just thought it was funny and one of the few low brow comedies that I actually don't mind owning on video.
0	What's the Big Deal?: With all the hype, I expected to be floored! It dragged -- the gags were infantile and not funny at all! I've got to say this was one of my great disappointments!
1	The funniest movie I have ever seen!: I am very skeptical of comedy. It takes a lot to make me laugh. The American mass-media concept of what is "funny" rarely, if ever, appeals to me. This movie was different. It was artistically, stylistically, intensely hillarious. Bravo to the director and the cast! Thank you for making me laugh out loud...it's been a long time.
1	Great for those who understand the comedy: I have read all of the other comments and laghed along with the great comments but was a little upset with the one raters. In this movie you have to understand the comedy.. not that you have to be a teen but the comedy is not for your average person. It's for the people that like outrageous unusual comedy like the scene with the dog or witht the hair gel. And the story is great too especially the end where all the guys who like her are in her house. It is SO FUNNY! If you know what comedy is.. you'll enjoy this!!!!
0	What an appalling movie !: I listened to the hype but borrowed the DVD before I bought it. I am so glad I did - one of the worst films I've seen in ages. The whole theme of guys trying to get their leg over is far better done in Notting Hill. There are about 2 funny moments in this film and even then I found myself embarrassed about laughing (well, sniggering) at them.
1	Loved it: I love the idea of a bunch of guys being in love with the same woman, and it coming down to the end where they all confront her. And the Brett Favre cameo was definitely unexpected. Truly a masterpiece of comedy.
0	Cat: If you can read and/or spell the word above, you're too smart for this movie. Boring, moronic, and (worst of all), not funny.
1	I have never laughed so hard at any movie.: If you haven't seen it, do it now. This is a must see for anyone who loves a good laugh at any cost. From the pizza delivery guy, to Matt Dillan's teeth. You can picture yourself in any situation that occurs in this movie. Watch it with someone you love. Anyone got any hair gel?
0	What a stupid movie!: This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Why did they have to make a movie about a geeky kid trying to get a guy hired to go look for his old girlfriend. I think that's a dumb idea. Cameron Diaz is pretty hot in this movie but the whole movie is just plain dumb. When I first saw this movie in the theater I thought it was allright but now that I watched it so many times on video it has gotten boring and stupid. If you want to see a movie that's more funnier go rent American Pie that movie's hilarious. Stay far away from this movie it's dumb!
0	Funny.: The performances were fine but the script was weak as the plot.The good things are the funny scenes that you watch in the trailers and no more the rest is a superficial and stupid story.But the funny are very great I really laugh.
0	There's something about Mary--Something foul about Mary!: This movie starts out with a lot of promise, with lots of laughs, but by the second half-hour, one is just clamoring for it to be over. It's an extremely uneven movie (although it must be noted that none of this is Cameron Diaz' fault, who does the best she can despite a poor script). The movie is a bore, and a waste of time. What a silly movie- just skip it!
0	What are they thinking??: I hate it when they don't create a Blu Ray with a proper master copy! Why the hell would they bother using a lower quality copy to create this??!?! It's just plain lazy. Don't bother buying, as it is obviously about the same picture quality as the DVD you already own!WAKE UP MOVIE STUDIOS!! IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE HIGH DEF, FROM THE ORIGINAL MASTER, WHY WOULD WE BOTHER BUYING IT IF THE PICTURE IS THE SAME AS DVD!!!
0	There's nothing about mary....: I only gave this movie1 star because you can't give negative stars. This movie is painfull to watch, stupid, corny, and just plain not funny. Most of the jokes have been done before in one for or another. The plot is thin with too many plot twists. The ending is totally predictable, and so is a lot of the plot (even the twists). In short, a movie to avoid.
1	Classic: Who doesn't love a classic? The only thing I missed were the pictures, but I read it to my girls Christmas eve and they loved it!
1	A classic tale with Amazingly beautiful artwork: My son constantly wants me to read this book to him. The illustrations are beautiful and the story is a classic. I'm sure this book will become a family heirloom.
1	night before chtistmas: great christmas book. just like the one i had as a child. my kids love it. given as shower gifts and new to be moms enjot the book
0	Text without pictures.: This edition includes just text, without pictures. Since I was buying this to read to my kids, I definitely wanted pictures, so I ended up buying another edition of the poem.
0	Poor quality: I was greatly disappointed with this item. Nearly every page was torn. Some drawn on & some had tape over the pictures. I bought this as a gift and I am hugely disappointed. The book couldn't even function.
0	Book's animotion is barely viewable.: The animotion is very dark and can barely be seen. It totally ruins the book. I will not be able to use it. It would have worked better to just had regular pictures.
0	Don't buy it for the pictures... there aren't any!: I was looking for this title to share with my first grade class, this is not the one, all words
1	Great book: My kids found this book very beautiful. The illustrations are amazing too. We definitely will read this book as often as we could!
0	Not great on Kindle: As far as the poem, it is exactly that. However there are many typos, including double capital letters at the beginning of nearly every sentence. The spacing between paragraphs is large and leaves one and a half paragraphs on every page. Looks like someone took a classic and tried to quickly format it for a kindle trying to make a quick buck for the holidays. Save your time and money, there are good copies to be had.
1	Must have for Colorado vacation!: I just returned from vacation in Winter Park, CO. This book was an invaluable resource. I knew exactly where to go, how to get there and what to expect. The guide is very accurate and easy to use. If only it could control the weather!
1	Awesome Book!: Great book! Well laid out and accurate...he has several others including another one for trails that are south of I-70...I have both!
0	Warning: does not cover Websphere 4.0!: I bought this book for the following reasons:* Seemed to cover J2EE including J2EE, including EJB development for WebSphere* Included a chapter on WSAD (Websphere Studio Application Developer)* High customer reviews* Low price (for used book)My biggest mistake was not to realize that the book was based on Websphere version 3.5 and the chapter on WSAD is based on version 3.5 as well, so this book was barely useful for me.It does have a good overview of J2EE, EJBs and Websphere, so I think that's what explains the high ratings: it is a good book if you're looking for introductory material on how to develop J2EE applications on Websphere, as long as you're developing on version 3.5. If you're using version 4.0 I recommend staying away from this book.
0	This is a remarketed title in wave of the recent "Eye" craze.: This is a remarketed title due to the recent craze of the movie, the Eye, thanks to the relentless bad American remakes of good Asian horror. This movie was originally called The Eye10. This movie came out quite a while ago and techniclaly it is the third installment of the "Eye" series. I am a huge fan of Asain horror, including The Eye and The Eye 2 (The originals of course). However, the Eye10 has had such terrible reviews I could not bring myself to spend any money on it. If it ever shows up on cable as a free movie, I would try to watch it just to see how bad it really is. I think it is crazy that this movie was retitled for Americans (even though it is not an American movie and has not been remade, make no mistake that this was renamed for the benefits of the Americans through Lionsgate to cash in on the recent aforementioned popularity). If you want a proper review of the Eye 3, google the Eye10 and read (and weep) all about it!
1	No whack trax on dis disc!: This album is live! A silly skit starts out the cd.It is based on the Coming to America movie! Then the music starts out with Rollout,the first single.Overall this cd has better beats and rhymes than Back for the first time.The lyrics are definetely more tongue in cheek.Other bumpin trax are Go 2 Sleep,Cry Babies and Saturday.One very touching song,Growing Pains is his best song yet.Hopefully it will become a single.It is that good.Check out this disc,I think it deserves a 4.5 out of five for more maturity and cleverness.
0	this guy's the worst.........: Can anyone get this bozo to shut up? He's so goddamn annoying, and he seems to be getting worse with every new album.Stop supporting this moron, people and listen to some real music for a change.
1	Masterpiece: This has got to be one of the best Southern rap CD's ever released! Luda has both great beats and lyrics which is a great follow up to "Back for the first time". My Favorite Tracks:1.Coming 2 America 2.Rollout 3.Move 4.Go 2 Sleep 5.She Said 6.Growing Pains. Great Album!
0	shipper sent me wrong cd then did not respond to emails: i waited three weeks for this cd then when i got it the cd inside the case was some bass test cd.
0	Very disappointing: This book spends too much time on all different types of drums rathar than concentrating on what I, and a majority of people who buy this book want it for: To play your standard rock band drum set. Also, if you don't have any music foundation, such as reading music, forgot this book. It spends a very short time teaching you how to read sheet music and if you don't understand it then the rest of the book is useless. I came close to throwing it in the garbage several times but keep coming back to it, figuring I'm missing something but I've yet to figure this poorly organized and written book out. Maybe this is the 'Dummies' style as I've never read one before. I found more helpful and free information on the net.
1	Cute: Will help complete our halloween decorations for next year. Have not used it yet, but they arrived in fine shape. WE currently have Snowmen on for Christmas and they have already had people ask about where we got them...
0	Rip-Off: This review is not a review of the book (which, I guess, serves it's purpose just fine), but a review of the price. $70 for a spiral-bound book!?!?!?! As if college isn't expensive enough already.
1	Yoga is such a wonderful tool for children: Yoga provides such a great tool for children to learn how to understand how their emotions and body interact. This is a great DVD for teaching your child how to relax, how to implement breathing practices into their every day activities and how to have fun while getting exercise.I would like to see more DVD's focused on families practicing yoga together. This would be a great tool for after school programs or creating play time for a few children to interact in a controlled environment.Need to make this an app for your phone!
1	AN ANGEL SENT DOWN FROM HEAVEN: I can't explain the timeless quality of this album...themagic created by songwriters David Holster and Suzanne Paris
1	Pretty Cool: Although this wasn't one of my favorite books in the story it was still informative. Rand goes is STILL in the Aiel Waste which is tiring, but his bond with Aviendha grows and becomes love. but this is the book that starts the series sex scenes too. yuck! and there is a forsaken fight! yes! I find the fights between Nyneave, Elayne, Birgette, and Valan Luca or whatever his name is quite humorous. And Nyneave's love craving for lan romantic. Though at the end the when Rand reaches Cairheien, he is suprised at the death of Moiraine and Asmodean. Fortunate for your guessing purposes, it leaves you stumped with 2 questions*Who killed Asmodean?*Is Moiraine really dead?But you will have to read the other books to get more clues!
1	Wheel of Time keeps on turning, and surprising: What a series! Started reading based on my son's recommendation. Interesting, once I got going, and it continues to take me places I never could have imagined. Never boring, some loose ends and leaps of logic, but it keeps you glued so that you continue reading the books. This book maintains a high level of imagination, surprises and plot twists. I love that the women characters act, think and react like real people. These women are inteligent, strong, courageous, and far from timid. So far I am impressed and genuinely enjoying reading this series of books.
1	A good book but Jordan is starting to slip.: I thought The Fires of Heaven was a good book. But Jordan is starting to slip. It seems that Jordan is repeating himself. But when I finished this book it seemed to me that the six book was going to be better.
1	TFOH-- two thumbs up: I really enjoyed this book-- book six hasn't gotten here yet and the wait is almost unbearable. I didn't give it five starts because Elayne began to really tick me off around page... two hundred? Some of it was predictable but overall I thought it was well done, and it's keeping me waiting for "Lord of Chaos". Well worth the read.
1	Great series: These books have well developed characters and plot lines that remind me a bit of the Game of Thrones series.
1	A step up from Shadow Rising: After a couple of chapters to set the stage, the Rand plotline moves forward at breakneck pace throughout this volume and a number of important events take place (including the biggest mystery of all in this series!). My only complaints were that the Siuan/Min/Leane and Elayne/Nynaeve threads moved too slowly at times. However, the Elayne/Nynaeve thread still had some critical events take place. I truly enjoyed the Rand/Aviendha interaction, as I did Mat resisting the call of battle at first before giving in. The last100-150 pages of this book are shattering, and really serve as the conclusion to the events from Shadow Rising. While it dips in parts, this is a solid four rated book and really makes you yearn for the next book.
1	Much improved: 'The Fires of Heaven' is much, much improved from #4 in the series. Jordan completely eliminates every one of his overused phrases from 'TSR'. No more people muttering under their breath or smiling amusedly at another's embarrassment. (Okay, so the women still like to try on different, outrageous clothes in Tel'aran'rhiod..and they're surprised by someone every time, but no one's perfect)Like all of Jordan's books, this one bogs down a little in the middle..but it's a much shorter period than normal. The action pretty much goes straight throughout. I was left at the end wanting more.
0	Dream is NOT a delirium: Hobson does not understand the topic he is studying. Dream is not at all a "delirium" but a very complex organisation of consciousness.
0	A different, lesser, Sayers: Thought I'd read all of Dorothy Sayers' mysteries years ago, but never got around to this one before; turns out I hadn't missed anything all that time. Not a Lord Peter Wimsey story, but does take place in the same universe -- there's a minor character who's also a minor character in the Lord Peter corpus, and I think there was a throwaway line in a Lord Peter story referring to this murder.It's a gimmick book: it's not presented as a traditional 3rd-person narrative but as a collection of personal letters, newspaper articles, memoranda, and sworn statements. The gimmick is cute, but not successful: too much of the book (especially in the second half) is carried by the sworn statements, which are sufficiently story-telling to make it mostly a1st-person story (albeit told from a couple different1st-person points of view). And as a mystery it's very lightweight, and too broadly given away.
0	terrible adaptation of.........: a very good book. Much like Bonfire of the Vanities, this was horribly miscast and butchered. How this ever fell into the hands of John Carpenter and Chevy Chase, I'll never understand. Someone else mentioned that Harrison Ford would have been better cast as the central character and I think that's pretty much dead on but the screenplay would have to have been trashed and put in the hands of someone who wanted to create something that actually represented the original and also in the hands of a more capable director. John Carpenter may be good at what he does but he was way out of his depth with this and was probably incapable of controlling Chase. Bottom line, the books very good if not great and the movie is a huge disappointment that really sucks. On the other hand, if you're a big Chase fan, go for it.
1	Ideas for Language Arts Instruction: Ideas and Insights: Language Arts in the Elementary School is an excellent book every educator teaching at the elementary level should own. This book focuses on the whole language approach to teaching elementary language arts. It connects classroom practices with the theory that undelies them.Moreover, what interested me the most is that it is teachers, who have studied children's literacy development who discuss the reasoning behind new teaching methods that are replacing workbook exercises in language arts and not people who have never been in a classroom setting.In Ideas and Insights, these teachers comment on activities, developed by practicing teachers, for reading, writing, speaking, and listening.
1	New insight: This book offers an interesting insight into the writer Vasily Grossman and contains a fine selection of some of his best writings during the war. A worthy publication that brings an important writer to life.
1	A real suprise find at my public library: Just an ordinary guy who likes to learn about the world by reading non-fiction from my public library. Takes a while to get used to the way the original notes of Grossman are interspersed within the editors explaination of the setting. Grossman truely was the Ernie Pyle of the Soviet Red Army. The editors give me the feeling that Stalin probably would have sent him to the gulags or worse after the war simply because he was "human" in his writing, if he had not been so popular as a correspondent for the official Red Army newspaper. If the USSR had broken up after Stalin died, maybe he could have compiled all his notes himself into a great read about the ordinary soldiers and all the generals, but the editor and translater did well putting his notes in order and tying them together to make sense of it for us. Now I'll have to see if any of Grossman's earlier novels are available in English.
0	The thing is huge. Too huge for a car. Put on your18 wheeler!: I guess it is my fault for not checking the size.It is too huge to put on the back of my jetta.Go Jets!
0	good for101 courses, not for real scholars: The encyclopedia is poorly organized, and too many outdated sources for many entries. Extremely bad for Art Historians! If you want a particular site, one must search for it under its location. Not theme or era. There even isn't an entry for the Romanesque era!! And there isn't any for San Isidoro de León - Panteon de los Reyes. While the writer of "Historia Silense" might have known King Ferdinand; the writer wasn't a monk at Sahagun!! He was either at Silos or at Leon. Once again Routledge has proven itself unable in doing a great encyclopedia of the era.
0	Gagged: I'd say it was a book purposely written stupidly to appear clever. I found it extremely dull. I gagged out1/2 way through it. I gurantee I can write better than this. If an unknown author had submitted this story to a publisher, it would have been returned with a rejection form letter.
1	My second favourite Vonnegut!: Although I have have only read three Vonnegut novels so far, this is my 2nd favourite out of all three. (Slaughterhouse-five being my favourite.) It's story tells of Dwayne Hoover, a car salesman who is slowly going insane, and of course Kilgore Trout, the science fiction writer whose on his way to Dwayne's home, Midland city, to an arts festival he's just been invited too. My favourite part is the ending. Now I won't spoil it for you, but when I finished the book I felt the ending to be quite dissapointing, but I thought about it for awhile and decided I loved afterwards. Vonnegut creates a beautiful portrait of insanity and humour in this brilliant piece of fiction!!!
1	Awesome. And so on.: I found this book thought provoking and hilarious. I really enjoy the writers easy style. The character development was excellent. All these parallel lives summing into one big crazy soup.
0	A Waste of Time: Breakfast of Champions is the first Kurt Vonnegut I've read. I hate to say it but I was not too impressed. I was hoping for a book that would be challenging. What I got was a book that used infantile humor in the guise of satire to try to impress the reader on just how clever the author is. If he has a main point, it seems to be that we are all empowered individuals and that all others are there to act as robots to interfere/interface with our lives. This viewpoint is just too cynical and cold for this reader. I very much doubt hat I will be reading any other of Vonnegut's works.
1	Vonnegut's funniest book: It would be hard to describe the plot of this book. I've read it more than 5 times and I cannot explain it. Something about a transvestite guy named Harry LeSabre who sells cars, but not Buicks. Kilgore Trout, Dwayne Hoover. They're all interconnected and in fact everything that Vonnegut writes about starting with Cat's Cradle emphasizes that some people are in the same "carass"(people whose lives are intertwined whether they know it or not) for their lifetimes. Maybe our lives are not as random as we thought. I laugh out loud whenever I read this book. I read it twice when I was pregnant and had a boy with a great sense of humor.
1	A Giddy, Existential Delight: "Breakfast of Champions" was Kurt Vonnegut's birthday present to himself as he reached the half-century mark. How gracious of him to share this purging with the reading public. Dark, disturbing, and hilarious, this novel stands among the finest of the previous century. Courage. Bravo, Mr. Vonnegut.
0	Mixing totally different languages and cultures: Baltic countries has distinct difference from Slavic cultures and languages, besides they are not in Eastern Europe as so many archaic minds including the compilers of this book consider.Even within the Baltics languages differ so why make such generalizations and throw all these languages in one pot.You will be surprised how similar Estonian is to Finnish as they're both Finno-Ugrian languages. Surely this book ignores the basic linguistic facts and doesn't facilitate the traveler's life.
0	I didn't like it.: I just didn't know what I was getting. I don't like this one. I didn't even watch all of them. The first one was so bad.
1	Best sub drama of all times: This movie is the best sub movie of all times. Sean Connery plays Captian marko Ramius who intends to defect. Alec Baldiwn plays CIA agent Jack Ryan who goes on the hunt for the Red October. Finnaly Scott Glenn gives an excellent secondry perfomence as Capt. Mancuso of the USS dallas. All in all this is a great movie for any one who likes sub movies.
1	Absolutely wonderful!: "The Hunt for Red October" is an absolutely great adaptation of one of the best novels ever written. The producer's of this movie took Tom Clancy's masterpiece and made one of the best military action movies ever. While they didn't stick to the novel perfectly, that's no big deal, it's still a great movie. Sean Connery, Alec Baldwin and the rest of the cast performed admirably. Although later films have Harrison Ford and now Ben Afleck in the role of Jack Ryan, to me, Alec Baldwin epitomized Jack Ryan. Sean Connery turned down the role of Sybok in Star Trek V to do this role, clearly a no brainer there. I would recommend this DVD to anybody. I would also recommend the book.
0	Do NOT buy from this seller!: I ordered a video tape from this seller about six weeks ago, and after about a month of waiting, I emailed the seller to inquire about my purchase...no reply, and STILL no product. Save yourself the time and money and DO NOT BUY ANYTHING FROM THIS SELLER!!
0	Terrible Picture Quality: This DVD is so low in picture quality it is not worth purchasing. It looks like a used VCR tape that has been watched many many times. Don't waste your money on this one.
0	Horrible Video Quality: I love the Hunt for Red October and the makers of the DVD did it a horrible injustice. The video quality is horrible. I tend to buy DVDs for the enhanced video quality, but save your money on this one. Just buy the VHS version and save your money because it is not worth it.
0	Film 5 stars, Bluray qualtiy1 star. Film's DVD is far better.: One of very few DVDs I *often* re-watch, and excited to purchase the Bluray version, I am terribly disappointed in the lack of image quality. The Bluray version on my very new contemporary Bluray player and year old HDTV, is extremely grainy to the point of distraction & disgust. I wasted my money and will go back to watching the DVD version.
1	Exciting!: An excellent portrayal of intelligence and cunning by Sean Connery. The movie is both exciting and thought provoking, very entertaining.
0	Do not buy this!: Great movie (as we all know) but the BluRay edition if horrible. We can barely make out the audio even with the TV turned up double the volume. Save your money!
1	The Hunt for Red October: Great movie, Sean Connery played his role outstandingly.The Hunt for Red October (Special Collector's Edition)
0	Not As Advertised: In building out a DC powered rack,we were looking specifically for a12VDC powered rack-mountable switch. The unit arrived as a 9V, with attached documentation "included power supply as required" in the specification. So we threw it out, and have ordered a different unit. For a home user, it would make no difference... but if a unit is advertised with power supply specs, then I expect to receive same.
0	Shallow and boring!: I ordered 5 books including this one, and all of them are so very shallow, low level and boring.Some of the chapters were actually copied in several books! Unbelivable.I would probably recommend this series to school children interested in management - nothing more than that.
0	Bridgmans Books: I bought 3 of Bridgmans books: Life Drawing, Constructive Anatomy and Heads, Features and Faces after reading the reviews. No one mentioned that most of the pages are dedicated to the anatomy of men, however I am interested in the female anatomy, so, these books did not work for me.
1	A Personal Note From the Author . . .: Nobody could have anticipated the recent events ever happening to our country. My heart and prayers go out to everyone involved including those watching from their homes that wish to help. I pray for you daily. I also urge you to help with your prayers and to find Jesus if you haven't already.In light of what has happened to our country recently, I cannot begin to stress the importance of the subject matter contained in my book and books like mine. If you are searching for answers about a God that loves you, cares unconditionally for you and judges you based on your actions while on this earth, then this is one of the books for you. Take an adventurous trip to heaven and feel what it might be like to fly with angels. While you're there, pray for your salvation and those around you. If you are inclined to do so, pick up the Bible. I will glady take a backseat to that book any day.God bless.
1	Geek Humour at it's best: Snaggy and Nitrozac show their teeth in this wonderful display of Geek Comedy. Whether you're a geek, or not, you can't help but laugh at the comic misfortunes of Windows users, Linux users and Mac users alike as they try to live in a world full of people who have normal sleep patterns, and have no idea what it's like to have a 3:00 AM call from your boss screaming at you begging to know why the third line of the second paragraph on page 5 of the online catalog isn't bold, or why the server is returning an error. Prepare to stretch your laughing muscles when you buy this book. A must have for all geeks. Makes a great gift, and will never let you down when you need a pick me up. Buy two, because surely you'll want to give on to someone you love.
1	Very good book I ever read: I found it very helpful to prevent medical errors occured in administration of medicine to patients. It should be read and considered thoroughly in order to give your patients a safer service.
0	Not her best work: I love Kristin Hannah,,,usually! This book was a bit boring and predictable. I would not recommend! But many of her other books are wonderful.
0	don't waste your $!: This is the worst product as far as cool mist humidifiers go. I just bought it today. I agree with the previous review...it's just a bucket of H2O with a *wick filter* & just a fan blowing cool air. I, too, thought it was missing a piece or I did something wrong. I just returned a Vicks one as it was too loud & there was no on/off switch, but it worked! I'm going to return this one first thing in the morning. Don't waste your money!
1	Monster Book: Book is amazing. It has full color pictures from the actual Monster Garage show plus other pictures. It goes into the peoples careers who are fabricating the parts. Overall good value for the price.
1	Space by Andrew Chaikin: This is a coffee table size book with many spectacular photos from space and from other aspects of the Space Program. Andrew Chaikin has don his usual marvelous job with this book. It is even more than I expected and it was received in new condition on a timely basis. I intend to get all of Andrew Chaikin's books.
0	Lacking high level details: This guide is missing some essential details that are needed for higher level characters. It only has maps of about 3 cities (it doesn't have maps for Rome, one of the largest, most populated city in the game) and it doesn't have maps of the higher level zones either.The list of nano programs that this guide has does not include details about the higher level programs.Overall, this guide would be strictly for a newbie, if you are passed level 20, this guide would be a waste of [money]
1	Elvid - That's the Way it Is: This DVD of Elvis's times in Vegas is unbelievable. I am in awe when I watch it. So much better than the VHS version obviously because of the picture and 5.1 sound. On my bigscreen and home theatre system, it's almost as if I am there in concert. This is a must have for any Elvis fan. What is good about this DVD is that it is all rehersal and concert. Gone is the fan and other footage from the original.
1	must have elvis edition: this is my second elvis cd/dvd collection and its worth every penny, very satisfied with the fidelity and video recording, very informative history included. good luck
1	That's The Way It Is: RCA/BMG, Warner and anyone that sells Elvis products, know that the "hardcore" fans will buy just about anything related to Elvis. As to this DVD set, could it have been better? Yes. But I don't really have any big problem with it.
0	LOOKS LIKE CHEAP BOOTLEG: SAVE YOUR MONEY, ORIGINAL VERSION,IN MONO,THE OUTTAKES VERY POOR PICTURE AND SOUND, THE SOUND AND FILM OF THE AFTER PARTY SEGMENT OF THE OUTTAKES ARE COMPLEAT IN THE ENDING CREDITS OF TTWII S.E.2001 RELEASE, YET WARNER CHOOSE TO CHOP UP THE SOUND UP HERE, WHAT A UNNESSARY RIP OFF.
0	I want my money back from Time Warner: I just can't help believing! (Actually, this is one of the songs that is not included on this DVD. Can you believe it?) I have no idea how to access to those "Bonus Selections" that are listed. I think there must be something wrong with the production line. Read the other reviews, they are all true: all the great songs you like from the original version are gone! To all disappointed fans, send a complaint to Turner Entertainment/Time Warner Home Video and ask them to get things right and replace the ones we have bought.
1	DVD Elvis Thats The Way It Is: I was very impressed by the quality of the recordings and the picture was so crystal clear that it was like he had been flimed yesturday....it has a great song list....BUT....I actually sent it back because the bonus15 tracks that where supposed to be extra footage where actually not included..and allot of the song that where in the supposed bonus footage are teh songs that I like most....it was a real shame that they missed out the bonus footage as it would of made an excellent addition to your collection...also one thing that really annoyed me was that It came in one of those cheap card board covers, instead of the standard plastic sleve covers, which is really annoying as it easly gets wrecked and torn...in conclusion I would probably wait till they re-release it with the bonus footage!!
1	Disappointing: The background music is not clear and the CD was a waste of money. One star is too high.
0	Pretentious and Too self-involved.: I am not quite sure if there is a plot in this novel. It is a preachy novel about pornography and journalism. Xan Meo is more like an idealogy than a three-dimensional character. There is a sense of superficial intelligensia. The novel meanders with Xan Meo's [complaining] practically about everything. Smoker the journalism is a much more interesting character, but then again, Amis has to inject his snobberish intellectulism -- philosophizing everything.What is this novel about? A waste of my [money].
0	3 Things about Yellow Dog:1. Yellow Dog is a chore to read - its self-conscious post-modernity, its intentional tangle of narratives and voices, and its glee in confusing the reader make it tiresome from the first sentence.2. You can call me old-fashioned, but I have a taste for finding humanity in at least one of the characters - in Amis' novel, there are about a dozen characters to keep track of and not a shred of heart among them.3. I took this book from the library and suffered through it for weeks, enslaved to my own principles of finishing a book you start. But I was absolutely grateful when the library recalled it at about page 200. It's not worth a 50-cent late fee.
0	Finish it, then forget it: This is a disappointing work when compared to Money and London Fields and even Amis's shorter works such as Night Train and Other People. The book is all over the place really, but tangled up in the mess are dazzling threads of Amis's sublime wordsmithery. The behaviour of the characters strains credibility to breaking point and by the time you get near the end, you just want them all to f*** off. But maybe that's the point...
1	Captain Jack's woman: This is the pivotal novel of Laurens' Cynster series & Bastion Club series. For those unfamiliar with Mz Laurens' writting, it is also a good intro to her writing style. Her character development is excellent & the interaction between the main characters is witty & playful. She gives both Kit's & Jack's reasoning & point of view so one can easily follow how each misinterprets the others actions & thoughts. This novel has humor & wonderful romance with plenty of action both in bed & with the "bad" guys. These characters will reappear in subsequentnovels, so remember them! I strongly recommend this novel.
0	weak effort: The book starts well, with a strong female character but when kit meets our hero she becomes irrational,irritating and weak time and time again. All it takes is a kiss and kit is unable to have a discussion about things that matter to her. Really, how sad is that she is so easily manipulated. I enjoy sex scenes but I'll confess that I skipped a lot of them out of irritation.
0	Poorly written and ill-organised: This could have been a very good book but the author seems to suffer from an inability to identify with an audience that doesn't already know the material.The material is all there and if you struggle through it you can find alot of useful insights...but more times than not the struggle isn't worth it. I can't suggest getting it unless you feel compelled to collect books on Apache or are in desperate need of more documentation.
0	Online docs will do...: I bought this book, but it turned out that I didn't really have to use much of it. The source program package from apache comes with a complete, up-to-date installation guide, online docs, pointers to FAQ and other info. If you are trying to set up Apache in the absense of any internet access (some kind of a boot-strapping process that someone might have to do in some special settings), this book might be useful. But that's usually not the case, and I wonder who would bother? For quick reference purposes, O'Reilley's Webmaster in a Nutshell would do a much better job for dollar.
0	Poorly organized and the butterthlies is a terrible choice.: This book is definitely a poor read. I got It because I thought the second edition would be a better read. These guys need to learn how to write and organize their thoughts better. There are other books that I'll buy over this one. The trick is to make it simple and have good flow; even the choice for the website (butter*) sucks. This review comes from a guy majoring in computer science.
0	Only a synopsis of info already out there: I could have written this book by struggling through with installing and understanding Apache myself. In fact, by installing Apache and looking through the documentation, I knew most of what was in the book already. There was no unique information here, or unique solutions to real-world problems. I think this book may save you time in an emergency or in general, but beyond that it's a bit dissappointing. I think the publisher said, "O'K', let's get two guys, have them install Apache, and write a book about it." That's just my opinion, though.
0	It's all uphill from here.: Usually purchasing an O'Reilly book on any topic is a virtual guarantee of excellence. This book is a notable exception. There are many other Apache books available, I can only encourage you to take a look at them. I have worked with Apache for several years, and this book fails me every time I turn to it for help. The on line documentation is excellent and is by far the better choice. This book skips over the essentials and the basics and wanders off to discuss odd topics that have never been of concern to me. Pretty much a waste of money and shelf space. Sometimes I do say good things, go read my review of Advanced Perl Programming by Sriram Srinivasan if you don't believe this.
0	I need something better: I did not like this book. I think you can do much better with another Apache book. The authors basically wrote a diary of setting up a webserver from start to finish. They seem board out of their mind and try to be funny ever once and a while. They copy the man pages word for word occasionally.I need something serious and authoritive where the authors are passionate about the subject like the authors in "Unix Power Tools" or "Unix System Administration Handbook"Come on O'Reilly, give us a better book on Apache and show us how to install PHP.
1	Somewhat helpful.: This was somewhat helpful in my study of vintage clothing. It is not as helpful for my needs as The Dictionary of Costume and Fashion.
0	Best of Bobby Rydell: After placing one order over a year earlier, giving up on delivery, then placing a second order and waiting over four months for delivery of this CD, it was a smashing disappointment! These are later recordings of Rydell's great hits, and pale imitations of the originals. What a waste of time and money!
0	rating Of1 Not For Bobby Rydell But For This CD.: This cd is a remake by Bobby of his songs,For years Cameo Parkway held the masters so artists like Bobby and Chubby Checker rerecorded there records how they did this leagally i do not know,but there is no reason to buy this collection when you can buy the Cameo Parkway Collection for a decent price and have all the original master recordings,and Chubbys is out there to.....Bobby is a class act though even to this day if you never knew this story,when Bobby was young his parents would take him to Wildwood,NJ. and he would be singing in the back seat.Bobbys father would ask him to please shut up and stop singing,and said your not a singer,but low and behold Bobby did become a singer and even sang about his Wildwood days.Wildwood NJ is certainly not the same town as the time Bobby sang about it but listening to this song you can relive those days just a little.
0	Rydell Remastered: This was the worst CD that I ever purchased. Remastered? It doesn't even sound like the same person. TOO much base. The original recordings from this era NEVER had that much base. Judging by this recording, I will never buy something that I know is remastered again. If the rating stars had a zero, that is what I would rate this CD. I think if Bobby didn't hear it, he should, I think he would be embarrassed.
0	No focus, every bit for every body: This book is for every body, I mean for nobody. Some stuff is so simple even for a beginner as me. Some, on the other hand, are so specialized that I skipped all together. Unless you are already very versed in Unix, you won't get too much out of it. ( Why do you need it if you are already versed anyway?)
0	My least favorite Swedish Beauty lotion: I've been using indoor tanning lotions, pretty consistently, for about10 years and Swedish Beauty has always been my very favorite brand. I've tried numerous lotions of theirs and Chocolate Indulgence is by far my least favorite. It's thicker than most and the smell is terrible! You definitely don't want to use this unless you can shower right away - in addition to smelling bad, the smell seems to get worse after tanning. I go to an awesome salon and with their beds normally see a difference in my tan the day of my tanning session - not with this lotion. The only use I can see for this product is maybe as a pre-tan moisturizer if your skin is very dry. I have had much better results tanning using lotions without bronzers from SB. My current favorites from SB are Priceless and Bronze Beauty - pretty much the same lotion but Priceless is from their blush line. Both of those work great!!
1	Great Book But Buy the Infinity Reprint Instead: "Saint Jack" is a great urban fantasy but the other published book is superior to this edition. The new edition has a larger type font and so is easier to read and contains great drawings which this edition doesn't have. So you should buy that instead of this. I happen to have both books being a big fan of this particular author.
1	What they promised is what I got: I've been very lucky with amazon since a lot of the times I end up receiving my products earlier than expected. This one I got it in time, not earlier but just in time so I can't complain. Very well paked, no damage, it was good/
0	1 marker, not12.: The description says you get12 pens, but you only get one. Yes [...] is a fair price to pay for1 pen, but if I had known it was only one I certainly would not have paid [...] for them to mail me one pen! Sounds a little too much like a scam to me. The seller was good enough to refund my money after I contacted them, so if you have bought this pen thinking you would get12, definately contact them and demand a refund. They certainly aren't in any hurry to correct the description as it has been over a month since I bought it and it still says12 pens.Regarding the pen itself, it is far from perfect. It will occasionally spurt out a large amount of paint onto your work with no warning, making a mess of everything, including your clothes. Other than that, the colors are good and when it doesn't squirt it works pretty good.
1	Good movie!: I thoroughly enjoyed watching this movie and am glad I decided to rent it. It's a classic and must see for anyone.
1	You never really know someone: This is one of the greatest depictions of a woman gone totally f_____g off the deep end I've ever seen. Which brings me to my point: some women you can get with, use each other and be done with it. And there are those whose diabolical intentions do not come to the fore until it is too late. Lucky for me, I got out of such a situation with minor scrapes a long time ago. This is a great film along the lines of the '78 documentary "Scared Straight". As far as the question of choosing between the lovely Anne Archer vs. the ugly Glenn Close...sometimes these things don't matter as much when enough erotic HEAT is being thrown your way. That explains that.
0	Ho-hum: This movie was okay. The first 30 minutes were kind of a drag. I'm not exactly sure why this film garnered as much attention as it did. I made note of the old style taxi cabs, the big shoulder pads on women's clothing, and the telephones with cords.Glenn Close was quite creepy and did a good job drawing the line between sanity and insanity. When she slit her wrists and wiped it on Michael Douglas - that should have been his cue to run away from her!! In the scene where they ate spaghetti, it made me want to eat spaghetti all of a sudden.Other than that, kind of boring, we all knew she was going to snap, it was alot of waiting to see it happen. Didn't really enjoy the film.
1	FATAL ATTRACTION INTRIGUE: JUST WANT TO SAY IT'S A MOVIE THAT KEEPS YOU ON THE EDGE OF YOUR SEAT NO MATTER HOW MANY TIMES YOU SEE IT. I SEE SOMETHING DIFFERENT EVERYTIME. I HAVE A QUESTION. WHAT IS THE LITTLE GIRLS NAME IN THE MOVIE? WAS IT ELLIE? WHAT'S HER REAL NAME? HAS SHE BEEN IN ANYMORE MOVIES? SHE WAS GREAT IN THE SHOW AND LOOKS LIKE A POSSIBLE ACTRESS TO REMEMBER. THANKS FOR ANY HELP OR ANSWERS.
1	Thrilling, Malevolent, and Brilliant: "Fatal Attraction" ventured where no other film seemed to dare risk-adultery. This was outrageously successful, and for good reason. Glen Close and the other major actors are magnificent, and the film is thrilling! Michael Douglas plays a man with a perfect wife and a kid, and he screws it up by commiting adultery. He thinks it's just a one-night stand, and that he can just blow off his alternative girlfriend. But, this girl he's had an affair with (Glen Close) doesn't like being ignored. She doesn't like being treated like a slut who can just be used. So, she begins to stalk Douglas, call his phone non-stop, destroy his car, and some very dispicible things which I will not divulge. Something I enjoyed about this film were some of the similiarites associated with the movie "Cape Fear". If you're like me, and you love those types of thrillers about pyschopaths, you should definitely watch this movie!
0	Average Re-Thread but good storyline: while the Song itself is pretty much a Knock Off of "The boy is Mine"&a few other things because I can pinpoint where Kayne West gets some of His Suff from,the storyline is interesting.Brandy Vocally though is not as Good as She was back in the day.Her Voice is missing a certain spark.She still has the Cross-Over vibe in Her Material that will always get Her some kind of a Hit but that doesn't mean you are gonna get solid results from Her vocal chops anymore.
1	by a reader/writer.: This author has the rare ability to get under the skin of wildly different characters to such an effect that the reader is not only entranced but emerges with a deeper understanding of these poor mortals, of which we are one. Beautifully written, powerfully effective.
1	Great Cat: The catalytic converter did not look new like the picture you see on amazon. It looked a little faded due to shelf life or something but, I did fit perfectly and my car is a lot more fuel efficient. No problems yet and I doubt that there will be because magnaflow is a great company with great products!
1	Great reading regarding Waterloo: This book is the intersection of the families represented in These Old Shades and Devil's Cub(Avon), and Regency Buck (Audley). Makes for a compelling read regarding Waterloo and an excellent period romance.
1	The best book on World Class Manufacturing: This is simply the best book I have ever seen on World Class Manufacturing. It explains the concepts in simple terms, using a short story that anybody can grasp. All the world class concepts are here: jit, error-proofing, rapid build, etc. The book also has a terrific glossary and explanation of world class manufacturing terms. Again,the best I have ever seen. And it has a great reading list for people who want to go into more detail with longer and more technically complex books.
0	Too little useful information: This book's strong point is that it covers a very large amount of information on java programming. This, however, is also it's weak point. It doesn't cover anything in any useful amount. I think if it covered half the subject matter, and went into depth on the subjects it did cover, this book would be a must have. I'd skip it unless you just wanted to see what java was capable of. It provides a good survey of java topics. I'd buy books on the subject you were interested in, and skip this one. I returned mine.
1	mormonism for dummies: I was very well satisfied with the book. It explains mormonism in words that are very easy to undersstand and it explains our beliefs accurately. It is very well written and complete.
0	Worst Possible Book on Mormonism: This author purports to be a Mormon, but writes without any authority on the faith. Her writings elsewhere have been gross misrepresentations of the faith. She has no authority from the Church to speak for them, either. If you genuinely want to understand Mormonism, there are good books available. This is NOT one of them!
1	Hmmm...: I was so glad to see that this cd had all new songs on it except for "The Year the Summer Ended in June", but after listening to this album over and over I find myself falling into the music rather than listening to it. To me, the album started to become background music instead of saying to my friends "Hey, check this band out." The musicianship is awesome mixed with plenty of techy riffs and pounding blasts of the kick drum and I like the vocals much better than their previous release, but that is due to production this time around (produced by Devin Townshend of Strapping Young Lad), I still find myself leaning towards the EP for more playability and a more raw sound. However, this is definately an album worth owning and listening to if you like metalcore.
0	A Natural Disaster: I remember one time this song (featuring Joe) was being played on the radio and after the song was over the DJ said, "Now that's what I call a natural disaster!" Then he chuckled and said, "I was just playing! It's a good song!" That DJ knows darn well he wasn't playing because I and other people even thought this song was a "natural disaster". Mariah was just better off doing a remake of "Make it Last Forever." Skip this at all cost. . . Oops! I just realized everyone has forgotten all about this song already. Never mind!
0	Awful! Don't waist your money: This piece of junk stopped working after two times. Don't bother ordering this because you'll regret it. Hindsight is 20/20.
0	Amateurish disappointment on a major league level: This book was scrapped together with content almost totally downloaded from software makers' web sites. Not even edited together in any coherent fashion. The same topics were treated multiple times in numerous places. Mr. Roman may be knowlegable about PDF workflow, but it doesn't show in this overpriced, over-rushed, overly-complex and already out-of-date book.
1	Good book for a new developer: I've been trying to make the jump from hotshot user to developer since my job has me developing applications for other users, and I've tried a couple of Access books that just didn't cover all the bases for turning a fairly advanced user into a developer. I liked this one because I thought it did an understandable job of doing this.
0	Every time i S@#T, this is pretty much what it sounds like.: I will say that this cd pretty much sucked balls. If i could give it0.5 stars I would. The track names pretty much sum up the album. "Kill The Music", "Bored Stiff", "Pretty Dirty". Yup, thats the album in a nutshell. No metal element whatsoever. More like heavy punk with a bad-tasting hardcore twist. Again, it's to the drink coaster/frisbee/door stop/TP/whatever else you would like to use this cd for.
0	not a good book to start with: if you start learning UML, this is absolutely not a good pick. The orgnization of this book is poor. Some parts are reiterated more than 3 times, some are seldomly mentioned.Too many messy diagrams makes readers like me confused.
1	Unusual and surprising read: Recently I read the wonderful Peace Like a River, in which one of the youthful characters is a Zane Grey fan and writes poetry in the western mode. Remembering that Zane Grey was one of those authors I always meant to read, I located a copy of Riders of the Purple Sage and settled in.Like several of the other reviewers, I found the book an ambivalent read, but one that ultimately hooked me. The anti-Mormon tone is a bit thick, and the heroic cowboys are as realistic as James Bond. The sentimentality drips at times, and the dialog is stiff. Yet. . .the story is catching, and it is fun to see how so many of the western mythic and archetypal elements Grey weaves into his most famous novel. Great literature it isn't, but take on its own terms, it's enjoyable.
1	Great for Heels: I bought two of these and stacked them on top of each other. They were super easy to assemble and I love that the length is adjustable. I am using them for heels, so they work great. As other reviewers have mentioned, these racks are for heeled shoes. I read another review that said she just turned hers so it faces the other direction for un-heeled shoes and the shoes butt up against the wall. Makes sense to me! As I was aware that they were for heeled shoes and that's what I wanted, I would definitely recommend this purchase.
0	Hope springs eternal: I would truly, truly like to review this book, in either a negative vein, or glowing positively - thrilled with it's boundless content. Unfortunately, I haven't actually received the book in question, so there's really not a lot to say. In my heart I keep hoping that it will be delivered one day, any day, sooner rather than later would be nice. And, after the headlong rush of reading and absorbing the copious content (it's a big book after all I've been told), I hold addional hope that I will still have sufficient drive to get that real review out the door and on to the pages of Amazon where it belongs. Maybe next month - see you then!
0	dissappointing: I expected a mix of some basic information and new sources or ideas, but there was really nothing new here. This might be a good resource for someone who has never been exposed to any facet of financing a college education or someone who wants to go into a field for which the education can be free, but you won't find anything too useful if you've already made your plans, or taken out loans, completed a FAFSA and researched on-line unless you just need a review or the process.
0	Battery Life: I received the F800 in good order and time. The battery failed within a week after first usning it. I was very careful not to leave the unit on after using to insure battery life. Perhaps something else failed but the results were the same - - - in the garbage can!
1	Great advices.: Internet books usually have an "expiry date", because of the rapid changes. This book holds some timeless advices. It is an excellent guide, although on a general basis. The price is attractive as well!
1	great: Denzel Washington, John Lithgow and Ice T are great in this movie. I thoroughly enjoyed the movie and recommend it.
1	Hollywood action with heavy drama (4.5*): This moviecould be described as Cape Fear In The Ghetto - Jon Lithgow matching Robert Mitchum in the powerhouse acting department, though taking it over the top for Friday night movie crowd.Lithgow is a crafty thug who somehow becomes fodder for Washington's "15 minutes of fame". DW is a recent Law School graduate with a view towards making a career in Law enforcement. D.A. Lindsay Wagner sees the amateur video of Washington saving a hostage's life *and* saving the life of the perpetrator, so he can be brought to justice with no extra gunplay.Jon escapes from prison, reunites with his Arian Nation buddies, and sets out to do to Denzel what Denzel did to him - take apart his life, piece by piece.There is an abundance of witty dialogue and barbs at the media, which by1991 had already joined the junk culture, with sensationalism where fairness and accuracy once prevailed.Will Styles (Denzel) makes his TV comeback?
1	The first movie to actually Shock me!: I first saw this movie just 2 years ago. I had already seen Pulp fiction, Dead man, Straw dogs, Reservoir dogs and A Clockwork Orange. The hype about there violence was always over the top and I was never shocked, but Ricochet I had heard no hype for, and I was Plenty Shocked, which was a very new sensation. The film is great, but I don't think its the sort you'd want to watch over and over. Denzel is great, as usual.
1	CARLIN...THE CAPTAIN OF COMEDY: I am so glad I was able to purchase this DVD as I live in Australia where George Carlin is not available. I've loved Carlin since college...and the older I get, the more I appreciate his irreverent, caustic, "anti"politically correct take on life. For Carlin lovers, I recommend this one. If you don't know his humor, don't stay in the dark any longer! Go get a copy of this DVD immediately!
0	Only1/2 the lights worked: I bought 4 boxes of these lights and in every case, only1/2 the lights would light up. Awful product.
0	Blu Ray ok movie was not: This is for children with imagination. I watched this 30 times as a kid and loved it. I have no idea why its pretty simple and bad. Kids may still sit through it.
0	ThE NoThInG: When the villain of the movie is "The Nothing" don't expect the movie to have all that much in it. No sword fighting, not really even much fantasy, no swashbuckling, or fair maidens, just a lot of peaking through hole in ceramic dishes, cheap costumes, bad acting, and [bad] dialogue. (It's so bad it will probably make you flinch.) Buy either Princess Bride or Lord of the Rings or just save your money!
1	This movie brings you to a world of woderful imagination.: This movie is about a boy who comes upon a book that looks too wodorous to be real. As he reads the book he soon becomes a part of the story and ends up having to save a world of imagination called Fantasia. You will watch as Bastian,Atreyu,and the Child-Like Empress race to save this world of wonder.Its just a great movie and way too good to not watch in your life-time!!
1	DVD: In a cardboard/plastic box. Mine came with the middle tab broken so the DVD is a little scratched from rattling around. Can't really complain for the price.
0	movie: Bought this item because it was a old time favorite from when I was a kid. Thought my son might enjoy it. Was shipped fast so I was happy with that. However the quality of the movie was not impressive at all. It looked as if it had been a poor copy of an original.
0	TERRIBLE job, Warner Home Video!!: BOOOOOOOOOO....How bout the studio actually get's the director involved w/ this blu-ray release instead of just releasing a bare-bones one? Apparently Wolfgang Petersen wasn't even acknowledged of the blu-ray release, which he says he would've loved to have been involved with, see article: [...]Not even worth $5, let me know when a worthy version with some involved extras hits shelves.
0	nonononononononononononononono: I suppose most of you who are raving on haven't read the book. If you do you'll realise the movie is trash. It stops where the book actually begins! Whoever made this movie just ddn't get what the book was about - it has so much depth!!!! The movie is just superficial special effects. Forget it! The movie ends with someone saying how many wishes Bastian gets to have fulfilled. The book shows just how furtile the entire proces of wishing is; it is a mystical tour-de-force. The book is10 million times the calibre of a cartain litle wizard who is getting too famous for the good of him. It has depth. It has everything. Read it! ANd forget this movie.
0	Zero stars. Please don't buy this.: I'm flabbergasted that they put the dumbed-down tv version of this movie on dvd and not the theatrical version. They took scenes out, changed scenes and dubbed dialog to create this mess of a dvd. Not only that, but the movie looks funny. The aspect ratio they used makes the movie look weird. I was eagerly waiting for this funny, well-done movie to be released on dvd and I am bitterly disappointed at this made-for-tv garbage. This tv version will only appeal to an unsophisticated mass audience.Attention Warner Home Video: If you are reading this, you need to issue a press release in which you apologize for this garbage and then announce that you will release an uncut version of the movie on dvd.
1	Talk about a classic...this is definately one!: This movie is one you will want to watch over and over again. It is an 80's classic and has far outlived it's decade.
1	This book is good on what it hits.: But it focuses on IP routing. This book contains lots of information on analyzing IP routing processes but other than the includion of IS-IS, there are no non-IP routing protocols covered. A more appropriate name for this book would be "Cisco Router IP Configuration: Answers!". Extra credit is given for not taking10 pages to explain a simple concept like most technical books do today. Keeping it short and to the point brought my evaluation up from 3 stars to 4.
0	Mesmerizingly Dull: If you have ever been cornered by an innkeeper or B & B owner whose life contains five minutes of interesting tidbits, but who takes two hours dragging you through a poorly synthesized tale, you've already had the experience of reading this book. To make matters worse, the quality of writing and tone are comparable to a sixth grade essay along the lines of "What I Did on My Summer Vacation."If you are looking for an interesting book about life as an American in the Caribbean, try Herman Wouk's semi-fictional "Don't Stop the Carnival."
1	Please book the1st flight to Anguilla!: If you have had the good fortune to visit Anguilla this is 'must reading'--you'll want to savor every word, every moment--but alas you'll spoil the pleasure by reading this in a day. For those 'wanabees' do yourself a great favor--buy the book. The Blanchards have written a very entertaining account of their business beginnings--you'll feel the trials and tribulations but with the flavor of a delightful rum punch, warm sun in your face and trade wind breezes always at your back---"when's the next flight???"
0	Never mind: I ordered this chandelier for a small bathroom. I was very pleased with it when it arrived, but when my husband tried to assemble it he found that the parts didn't line up correctly. It was impossible to assemble and we returned it. Happy with Amazon's return policy, though.
0	Too gaudy: Item arrived quickly and was well packaged.Bought this light fixture for our daughters room. It's cute but the larger plastic crystals are too big and so they all hang close together and overwhelm the overall look/feel of the light fixture making it entirely too gaudy and cheap looking. The same goes for the matching table lamp.
1	catchy story!!: at first i doubted it'd be like old-foggie style and really boring, but the story is really catchy!!! i really love the ups and downs in the plots and the way the author portraited it!! and without Goldman's abridgement this book would be nothing!
1	Fantastic book - and more!: I love this book. I love this film. It is a rare gift to love both a book and the film made from it, but for many of us it is true of this combination. If you love the movie, read the book. And read this edition! Although I already own the paperback, I bought this new Kindle edition. I didn't know it would have bonus features - like the wonderful introductions to the 25th and 30th anniversary editions. The visit to Florin. The tour of the Morganstern Museum. Goldman is an amazing writer. So clever. Give yourself time to sit back and enjoy this book.
0	The Princess Bride1st (first) edition Text Only: I ordered and received a copy of The Princess Bride. It was represented to be a first edition which is why I bought it, yet it was not a first edition. It was published in 2003. The first edition was published in1973, a thirty year difference.It was an excellent copy of a third edition.
1	I love this book!!: This is a book everyone can enjoy It has Action, love, and is just a great book. I hope everyone will read it!!
1	The BEST book ever written!: I am14 and this is my favorite book. It has everything a book should, and on top of that the writing could not BE any better! It's exciting, it DOES have a plot, a very good one at that, great heroes, great villains, and Great Humor. In a few words: The Best Book EVER!!!!
1	Who are you people?: It's been some time since I read this book, but I browsed these reviews when I recognized the title. Goldman writing is excellent, and yes, its a good story, but you can get the story from the movie in under two hours. The book is quite complicated with an excellent, almost cynical theme. It deals with an adult's reflections on the fantasies of his childhood from the perspective of the grownup world. Life isn't fair, and everyone lives happily ever after, until. . . . Still and all, the narrator feels obligated to tell the "good parts" of this fictional history, showing the continuing allure that our youthful fantasies still hold, and our wish that life could be a fairy taleJust for the record, of course Morgenstern, Guilder and Florin aren't real. Where did you learn history and geography?
1	That rare thing, a hard-to-find cult book that made it big: Years ago, I was fortunate to the dueling chapter of "The Princess Bride" published separately in a book called "The Best of All Possible Worlds" by Spider Robinson. It was, bar none, the finest, funniest fencing scene I had ever read, and I burned to read it. I searched nonstop for 6 months, haunting used bookstores and calling in favors from multi-national friends before I finally found a dog-eared copy with half the cover gone.It was fantastic. Everything I had hoped for, all the humor and adventure and even some deep stuff in there about the human spirit and True Love, combined with the flush of discovery and triumph.A year later the movie came out and the book was everywhere. Ah, well.If you enjoyed the movie you cannot help but fall in love with the book. It remains one of the few I re-read every year and I continue to loan them out to friends and family.
1	An all-time favorite, read the book, watch the movie: Ok, so both the book and the movie can be a little sappy, some might say corny, but it's one of those in my collection that I have read multiple times. I've even purchased copies for friends and family. It's a light-hearted, feel-good story with all the good parts. Good guys, bad guys, love, romance, greed, envy, swashbuckling, great derring-do, betrayal, and more. But, it's true claim to fame is: True Love. Read the book, and you'll understand.
0	For once, the movie was better than the book: I love "The Princess Bride" as a movie, so I thought I'd like the book. I was so wrong.I slogged through it, hoping it might get better, and was disappointed the whole way through. Maybe someone else might find its sexist tone ironic or funny. I found it distasteful.
1	GREAT READ!: This book is truly awesome! I have read it every year since1997, and still look forward to reading it more. Although Goldman's little inserts get pretty annoying from time to time, he writes it in a font that you can skip over if you wish. I am truly glad that Goldman decided to edit this book, otherwise, i don't think anyone would be able to get through it! The movie follows the book very closely, but the book gives more detail and background about Fezzik and Inigo! This is my favorite book, and i hope you all enjoy it as well!
0	I liked the real book, but the abridgement leaves stuff out.: The actual book is good, but I think the abridgement leaves out too much. I understood what was going on, but the book could have been much more interesting if few or no passages were removed.
0	Not really...: I loved the princess bride. I liked the movie and I own the book. I loved the book so much I got it on my kindle too. But, being the idiot that I am, I didn't look at the authors name. So I started reading it and found this guys biography. Well fine, I thought, just a little authors note, so I just skipped past it. I read on. Suddenly I found an APOLOGY for the little notes found in the parentheses. I knew the original. I knew these notes were more then authors note, it is this guys personal biography written into the story! I think it absolutely ruins the story. The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because it is such a great story.
0	The Princess Bride by William Goldman: I was very disappointed in this book. William Goldman totally ruined it for me. He opens with 31 pages of a long, boring, rambling, collection of his comments about the Princess Bride story. Additionally he gives a page of his ridiculous comments at the beginning of each chapter. He really ruined the story of the Princess Bride for me. I would never have bought this book if I had known this edition was about William Goldman and The Princess Bride is treated as a side story.
1	Book club: My neighborhood book club read for November. I enjoyed reading it, I saw the movie in the theater many years ago.
1	Always an adventure,the first time or the fiftieth: In my short life, I have not found another book that can capture ones imagination. The perfectly woven tapestry of details and adventure keep you on the edge of your. . .seat! I have given it is as a gift, and my friend rewarded me by saying it was the best gift they had ever received. I can only say "Thank you" to the authors.
1	Did the Trick: This book was a great help when I decided to take on the task of developing my company's database! It showed me all the tricks and tips that I needed to get the job done.
0	I don't know what shape person this is supposed to fit...: This jacket is basically just a windbreaker, and an uncomfortable one at that. My biggest issue is sleeve length. Does the manufacturer think people's arms end at their waist?? If I bend my arm the sleeve chokes up all the way to my elbow! What a joke...
1	Nice: Well made jacket. Rugged, fits well, insulated without weight. My husband was very pleased with it. This was a hit.
0	Good songs but technically flawed recording.: While the 2 CD set contains some good songs, the way the CDs were produced shows serious lack of attention to quality. There are considerable differences in both sound volume and tonal range, and while some pieces are clear and vibrant, some are muted and sound as if they were being played in the next room.
0	Too big, too small.: Although the quality is good, there was no mention of the actual size of this cover. I'm only able to put it over the table, for which it is too big but not over the table with the chairs around it as it was intended to be used. So now I just have a too big cover over the table and nothing to protect the chairs.
1	A tragic tale: This book will keep you awake all night. Although you know Mr. Lincoln will be killed - it makes the reader keep hoping it won't happen.
0	A great book... in its time. Check out the 2nd edition.: This was a great book in its time. It helped introduce me to SCSI, and I learned a lot from it. Unfortunately, it is 5 years old now and SCSI has changed dramatically --for the better-- since then. I have been anxiously waiting for an update, and am excited that one is finally on its way in March 2000. IF you are thinking about getting this book, I STRONGLY recommend you wait until the 2nd edition (ISBN:1886411107) is released in March -- or pre-order it. At this point, this book is more of a history lesson than a technical guide. (PS, if not for the outdating of this book, it'd be a 5 star rating)
1	great: The item came in excellent conditions, well packed, very nice NEW, no defect, as i expected. . . . .
1	great movies: we have watched these over and over. this is a great movie and the price for both movies was so worth-it. these occassionally come on TV but with the disks we don't have to fuss with commercials and can rewind, pause, and enjoy the movies on our time.
1	Good movies: both like I remember them and good glad the I got them haven't seen in a long time, and i always find the movies i want on this site.
1	Even if you know how to write a Complier over the weekend...: and no one can teach you anything new, because you already know everything, I still think this book is defintely worthwhile. So if you are new to programming and/or Visual Basic this book is an absolute must-buy. Do yourself a favor and learn a clear, concise methodology from the get-go, before you fall in love with your own personal style.
1	Great product! It is 614: I have been using GUM proxabrushes. it is very difficult to find in stores. I usually get them at Wal-Mart. But recently I don't have any luck at all. They always run out of it. I am very glad to find it here. It is even cheaper than Wal-Mart. Shipping is fast, and price is great. I have no compliant at all. In case you don't know. This is model number 614. I assume they want to start using "tight", "moderate", and "wide" instead of model numbers.
1	Why make it from scratch??: I was a bit skeptical about a packet mix, but was very impressed with the end product.Honestly, it is better than my own home made - and that's pretty good!
1	A lot of fun: Another film that was showing in selected theaters only - not where I live!!!!! Couldn't wait to get this one after seeing a brief trailer. This movie was a lot of fun. I enjoyed the whole shabang. Easy to watch, great goofy characters, comedy, fantastic landscape, wonderful cartoon costumes, sillyness, and wonders abound. Fast paced beginning - a total improbable romp that is eye poping. Very hollywood, but with a Chinese sensibility.Recommended for the "noodle dish" acrobatics as well. Made me want to chow down on those darned noodles!Wonderful cinemaphotography - whats new - Zhang Yimou is an absolute master of cinemaphotography.Go for it!
1	could be cheaper: I like the .mac account, but it could be a little cheaper. Luckily Amazon sells it for less than what the Apple Store charges.
0	Forget the storage case: I bought this saw just to have a handy second saw in the garage. I figured the storage case would be handy, as it would be on the shelf most of the time. The storage case is pathetic. It takes longer to figure out how to put the saw back into the case than it does to go out to the shop and get my other saw. I'd give the case a negative star, the saw is about a 2 star.
1	HTC PM7000 Portamate Miter Saw & Power Tool Work Center: Excellent product. Good value, particularly because the worklight and vise accessories were included at no additional charge. Packing was not good because the end of one of the extensions was crushed during shipping. Customer service response was excellent, but the replacement part was also not packed well. However, the end result is that the device is well-designed and very functional.
1	AWESOME: This thing is sweet. I do however wish it was easier to get replacement parts (extra mounts for new stuff) you can pretty well only find stuff online for this brand. But overall it is great, why don't all the brands have power strips on them and come with work lights and a vice? Too bad for the Dewalt at Home Depot, I'm glad i went with the Portamate online.
0	Way to floral: I didn't like this fragrance its very strong and floral. It does last a long time if this is they type of scent you're into.
0	Clichéd: This is the first time I have ever written a review of a record on here and unfortunatly I've been moved to do so through abject boredom.This is the most clichéd, repetitive, cringingly bad record I have heard in a long time. I'm just glad that not everyone that listens to it will understand Spanish enough to shudder at each cheesy lyrics and forced stereotypes it contains. Really give it a wide berth.
0	Paradise Lost: I am innately suspicious of films that were bombs that later develope cult followings which appears to be the case with "Phantom of the Paradise" after perusing all the 5 star reviews(?!). I enjoyed director Brian DePalma's earlier forays into comedy with "Greetings" and "Hi,Mom" and later with "Scarface" but this film is virtually bereft of any humor, macabre or otherwise. This film does not work as a good rock satire like "This Is Spinal Tap" because it offers nothing resembling insight into that world. It does not work as a horror comedy because it's stabs at macabre humor fall flat. It does not even work as a good comic re-working of "Phantom of the Opera". The acting is nothing to write home about. I don't know what is worse, Paul Williams lame acting or the abysmally forgettable song score he contributed here. I guess this film can be appreciated on some camp level but you have to be in the mood.
1	Ready for something different ?: Phantom of the Paradise is a breath of fresh air. The first to give you split-screen and more is a classic love story. And good against bad. Root..Root...Root for the good guy. Hiss at the bad. Is it a nightmare or is it the music industry. Suprise: It's both.
1	High Quality Bag: I was looking for a small bag that I could use on day trips or hikes. I did not want a huge bag to keep all my lenses and accessories. This is perfect for my needs. I have a Konica Minolta 5D with a 28-75 f2.8 lens attached, along with a18-70 and a 70-210. I can fit the camera, lenses, my battery charger, and various cables. The lenses fit with their hoods on backwards. There are a couple of small pouches to keep extra battery and cards. Two features I really like:1) the micro fiber cloth that lies across the camera's lcd to protect it from scratches and 2) the top of the bag opens from the back for quick access to the camera.Small enough to carry all day, big enough to fit the essentials needed for a great day of shooting.
1	This completes the Kindle "Nuala Ann" Collection!: I originally had to buy "Irish Lace" in a print edition because it was the one Greeley novel missing from the Kindle collection of "Nuala Ann" stories. I'm glad that the omission of this second novel in the series was finally corrected. It carries on from Nuala's arrival in Chicago at the end of "Irish Gold" until her engagement to Dermot Coyne prior to "Irish Whiskey". It's nice to have all twelve novels in the series available on my Kindle.
1	As good as "Gold": Continuing the saga from "Irish Gold," Nuala and Dermot once again find themselves solving a mystery. However, the true mystery that is unfolding is the one surrounding their relationship. Greeley works his magic again making it difficult to put this one down. In fact, it took me only a week to read it. And I would recommend it to anyone. But, first read "Irish Gold" so you will fully understand and appreciate Nuala and Dermot.
0	Junk: Optima battery is garbage.. mine failed in 2 years and optima wont honor warranty because I bought it from amazon.
1	awesome.: This is an awesome battery. The only negative is the install into my 2006 Hummer H3 was a bit tricky because it sits weird in the battery box. Its not level and doesn't look right, but after pulling it out and trying to install it many different ways thats the only way it fits in the battery box. Definitely worth the money.
0	Viewer BEWARE! This is not a Horror Movie or even a good movie for that matter: My co-workers and I decided to watch this during a slow day at work. Judging by the cover, one is led to think...."Horror Movie" At first the errie atmosphere seems promising. As it drags on you realise it's meant to be a thriller and by the end of the movie it's safe to say homicide has been commited. That's right, this film just killed over an hour of your precious life that could've been spent doing something actually enjoyable. Nope, it's gone right down the toilet so to speak. This movie has one of the most dull endings I've ever seen, it's just a really bad, BAD MOVIE! Please heed my advice and walk away, otherwise, consider yourself warned.
0	Started interesting: It certainly doesn't lack a twist, but to say it's a clever one would be false. It really is entirely social commentary just after the middle of the movie, but not really social commentary that has any basis in reality or even political affiliation...it's a dreamer sentiment that implies adversity is wrong and elitist paths are the only way...that's not really what I thought I was getting into when I started a movie called "Tall Man" involving a creepy figure and child abductions. It's not to say I was hoping it wouldn't be intelligent, I'm saying it isn't intelligent. I gave two stars for the fact that it was an unpredictable twist, though a silly one.
1	Warming to the cause: After reading the first of this series I decided to jump straight into the second book and was glad I did. Following the various characters and their adventures without to much back-writing to introduce the characters for those who had not read book1 was a great advantage to being able to follow the story into this second book. The story continues without too many new characters to hold up the continuity. And so the adventure continues.
1	Not as great but still very good: I was a little disappointed in the sequel, but still felt compelled and interested in finishing the book. I loved every part of this book from beginning to end. Even though, at times, I felt frustrated by some of the slower movements in the novel. Still an excellent read though
1	Jordan takes off: While I enjoyed the prequel, Eye of the World, the second book far surpasses it. Unlike Eye, the Great Hunt gives no hint of ripping off Tolkien in plot, and the book benefits tremendously for it. Jordan is a master of running multiple plots at once. However, one thing he didn't abandon was his ability to describe things. His attention to little detail, like how houses are built differently in different countries, is the leading factor in his ability to make his world real. If his books keep this pace, this series may yet out do Tolkien.
1	Roads To Koktebel was ANOTHER great Art House Film: I agree that the pace was slow, but the story was very well drawn out for viewers. I look for films like this because, again, it was more about the disturbing (and somewhat depressing) story than 'the stuff that happens between the special FX'.Hollywood doesn't seem to make cool movies like this anymore (Except for "The Road")This wasn't the best film I've seen, but it was a welcome 'Change of pace' film, who's style seems to be disappearing. At least in the US.Spasibo and Do SvidaniyaJSIf anyone is interested, see if you can find (and watch) "Lilya 4-Ever" (or, depending where you look, "Lilja 4-Ever") w/ Oksana Akinshina ...it's a 'sad ...but very real' story
0	Lame: This movie drags on and on, leaving you depressed. I couldn't even finish watching it, I was so bored by 3/4 of the way through.
0	Como arreglarlo: Esperaba mucho de este juego... lamentablemente cuando por fin llego venia con las104 cartas.. de color verde!!!.. sin artefactos ni los otros decks...que lamentable que no pongan atención en esta manufactura... ahora tengo un juego inservible.. a la basura los 25 dlls
1	wonderful toy for preschoolers: My daughter just loves Little Leap - she considers him her friend. We spend hours playing with Little Leap. She has learned the alphabet and loves to sing along with Little Leap.She gets so excited when Little Leap asks her to pick the next letter and she gets it right. It is teaching her so many concepts relating to pre-reading. She is able to identify letters and is very proud of herself.Thank you for such a wonderful, fun toy.
0	Makes too much noise!: The sounds that the frog makes are very "tinny" and it is hard to understand what he is saying. I need to look at the letters/picture buttons in order to understand the corresponding sounds. Although this toy turns itself off, all you need to do is touch it or have something bump into it for it to go back on again. Needless to say, it is a very annoying toy and I see little educational value.
1	This Diverter Draws Attention: This is THE best diverter -- primarily because it is the valve AND trim in one!! I will, however, caution you to know whether or not you will need an extension kit (sold separately) to ensure that it is a perfect fit against your wall.
0	What a disapointment :(: Didnt like this series at all ... cheap production very disapointed.... would send back if I could ....would cost me too much in postage ... dont buy :(
1	Vermeer's Genius Revealed To All: This was the most interesting treatment of art and artists that I've ever been exposed to. The various art experts that appeared in the film went into great detail about the techniques used by Vermeer to obtain his wonderful lighting effects even showing, via infrared photography, that the artist had moved certain elements of the composition to make a more pleasing and focused work. A truly inspiring video. I can only hope that the other parts of this series come close to this level of detail.
0	A Great Disappointment: After looking forward to this recording with much fervor, I was very disappointed to hear the final result. The sound quality throughout is poor (the mike shorts out during Lou Reed's "Berlin," for which the liner notes apoligize), but other tracks are muddy, too, especially the encore, "All Tomorrow's Parties," which is further ruined by the voice of a woman offstage taking during the performance. Also, Nico suffers from an embarrasingly long coughing fit after she finishes "Janitor of Lunacy." Each of the trio have about one good song each ("Waiting for the Man," "Ghost Story," and "Femme Fatale"). The two "Bonus Tracks" are an insult to the consumer, just throwaway pieces that are not even complete songs, badly recorded. Even the die hard Velvet Underground fans should be wary of this one. The letdown of the year, and it's only Februrary!
1	WHAT?: These are great songs but I agree with earlier reviewers. This is not a greatest hits album. Why so few tracks over 2 cds? Roll With It, Whatever, Stand By Me, All Around the World, Hindu Times, Stop Crying Your Heart Out, Little By Little, It's Good to Be Free and Round Are Way are all BIG omissions. Especially Little By Little.
1	great shipper!: I had to purchase this book for my daughter's AP Biology class. The book was just as described. Excellent condition and everything included. I received the shipment promptly.
1	Out of Exile: A moving story of a life of the mind by one of Indonesia's seminal political thinkers and actors, it is a very human story of exile, love, love betrayed and loyalty to values we all claim to uphold written by someone who actually did so.
1	Wife loves it... which makes me happy: Got this for my wife's Christmas gift last year. She loves it. It matches our other bedroom furniture too. I was impressed because it wasn't as cheaply made as some of the comps. I was hopeful the back would be decorative as well, but it's not. No matter, no one sees that side anyway. Overall we're happy with it (I'm happy 'cause she's happy - that's how it goes) :)
0	Disappointing!: Although Juliette Binoche and William Hurt turn out imaginative perfomrances, this movie lacks dimension and reverts to the standard shrink/patient sketches through the middle of the movie that will have you sleeping on the couch. There was just not enough new material in the script to turn this into the comdeic romance that it should have been although it starts and ends well.
0	Aikido is not a sport: Aikido was never meant to be a sport and has never even considered itself to be. True aikido rejects all forms of contests and tournaments. Only Public demonstrations are given or should be given to show a display of constant training, not of ego accomplishment from the likes of sports where there is a winner and a loser. Aikido is not about who wins, who's tougher, or who is better, it's about personal achievement of mind/body. I must ask all to be cautious of such writings involving aikido being made to look like a sport or any competition. The founder himself and his family have always shared this view and rightly so. 2 stars for the knowlege that might be attained for the positive use and understanding of the art.
1	A really good young song writter: My girlfriend and I went to go see Jessica Simpson in concert and Ryan opened up for her and everbody loved him. He played about five songs and all of them where great they had great song writting and the music was very catchy and he has a great voice I really like "Shame On Me" on the new album I cant wait til his CD comes out Ryan is going to be the next big thing look out for Ryan Cabrera and buy two of his CD one for home and one for the car.
0	meh just buy the whole album: which has11 other songs just as good as this one. Just buying the single is a waste of money.
0	worthless: I was very displeased with this book. It is shallow bunch of trite, short notes on various seemingly uninteresting people. It's like "Chicken Soup for the Soul" only worse.
0	Yawn...: After reading just a little of this book you can stop turning pages because it's obvious what's going to happen next. Boring and predictable; I've read this book before, written much better, but never worse. Nothing new or original here. I've run into these stock characters many times before and that was more than enough. For me this was a waste of time. Has the obligatory sex scenes: yuck. Secret History of the Pink Carnation should not be allowed in same room with books by Austen or Heyer.
1	What are the critics thinking?: I don't know who wrote the reviews panning this book. I thought it was GREAT! The history was NOT inappropriate, and I found myself laughing alous, especially at Richard's family. It reminded me of Julia Quinn and Kasey Michaels--top-notch romantic humor. I can't wait to read the sequel, and I hope those who disliked the first give the second a chance to change their minds.
0	Don't waste your time: Quite possibly one of the worst books I have ever read. I think the author may have been going for a satire of the Scarlet Pimpernel story, but this book is dreadful. Clichéd characters, people who speak and act like 21st century characters in a19th century setting. Laughable dialogue, a contrived storyline, from start to finish there is nothing to recommend the book.I thought I was getting a good historical fiction, what I got was a bad romance book and most unbelievable of all to me is that this appears to be the first of a series.With all the wonderful writers out there, the fact that this book was even published is astounding.
0	How disappointed can a Book Club be?: Based on a review of this book, my book club decided to read it. When we then got together for our monthly meeting to discuss the book, our meeting quickly turned into a meeting of laughter and unbelief. How in the world did Miss Willig get this book published? Unfortunately, we all agreed that it is by far, the worst book any one of us has ever read. Between the 'zaps' and 'thumps' and so on, we were not sure if we were reading a cartoon. The vocabulary is not of the times, and the manner of writing is not only boring, but it detracts from a story which perhaps has potential. Between the12 of us in the book club, we might have read the whole book. Our suggestion is, please don't write the next book!
0	Dumb.: As a fan of The Scarlet Pimpernel, I looked forward to this book very much; thankfully, I got it out of the library rather than paying for it. I read the book in one sitting with a growing sense of frustration--nothing seemed real. The characters were completely modern, the war seemed more like a trip to Disneyland than a dangerous thing, and the characters were so dumb they deserved to get caught spying. There was no sense of realism to the book. Perhaps I expected the wrong thing, but this book seems almost disrespectful to the people who suffered during the time the book is set, as it has utterly no concept of their suffering.
0	Silly story: I read it quickly and thankfully it was soon over.Not much to the story except to highlight how one teacher dealt with her midlife crisis.Sky61
1	Christmas Would Be Just Another Day without Brenda Lee!: This is a great CD. But of course all Brenda's are. If you aren't in the Christmas mood, put this CD on and you'll feel the spirit of Christmas right away. The Angel And the Little Blue Bell will be sure to give you a tingle. I just love this song. Although I like the standards, it is nice to have fresh songs like Strawberry Snow and Marshmallow World. Christmas just wouldn't be Christmas without the dynamic Christmas music provided by The One and Only, Brenda Lee!
1	Obsessed: After just one show of Dexter I was hooked! Every season seems to get more and more interesting. I love this season and this show!
1	Great series!: I bought the first 3 seasons for my son and ended up enjoying it too. I can't wait until the newest episode airs tonight.
1	Dexter Blu-Ray: I haven't watched it yet, but, if it's as good as the first two seasons, I'll be happy. Delivery was prompt and packaging secure.
1	The series that keeps you coming back for more!: We've been watching this from Season One to Season Seven. It's truly awesome. Every season just gets better. You'll love all seven seasons from beginning to end. Don't miss any of them.
1	The best TV show ever: I have seen both season1 and season 2 of Dexter and just can't wait for the third one to come out on DVD as this is our prefered way to watch it because my husband and I become so hooked we can't wait a whole week for the next episode to come on. We would watch 5 or 6 episodes in one night.It is by far our favourite TV show full of suspence and twists.Highly reccomended to all.
1	Love Dexter: I have watched Dexter since the first show on the network stations. That got me hooked! When I learned that I could purchase the DVD's on Amazon I just had to have them. Amazon.Com has been great! What I like about Dexter is the fact that he lives a regular life while having this one secret! I watched Michael C. Hall on Six Feet Under and loved the part he played, I think he is great!!!
0	Just not getting it: Since many languages are based from the Latin, I felt it would be a great base. I'm having a little trouble getting into this one. I think it's because I'm just not quite ready for this particular style. I should have gone with one for dummies or something.
0	Broke my kindle.: In short, My kindle froze because of this book.When I first downloaded a sample of this book I couldn't turn to all of the pages but I liked what I had seen and thought the page turning issue was a problem with the sample format. I bought the full version. Big mistake. The book was slow to open and it took a long time to get to locations from the index. It froze temporarily weil I was turning to a page but I was able to get back to home. Something like two hours later when I tried to open the book again and an error showed up. I couldn't open it so I tried a different book that I can usually read. It also showed an error and wouldn't open. When I tried a third book the error apeared again and the screen froze. Now all I can do is put it to sleep and wake it up with the error screen.From the content I was able to see this book is seems to be a great resource. Just don't buy it for the kindle version.
1	Tale of Two Cities - Baltimore / Indianapolis: This superbowl V I remember as a youth barely and it was great to re-live this moment on dvd! I always loved Bubba Smith and the Baltimore Colts defense. On this viewing, this Superbowl V was not a very exciting game, filled with turnovers and some sloppy playing on both Baltimore and Dallas but good viewing anyway.I loved the commentary by Bubba Smith stating that since the organization left in1983, the Baltimore Colts players have been shuned by the Indianapolis Colts, the present Colts have no history of their team during the Baltimore years or don't respect it, what a shame!!This dvd is still a great view!
0	ONLY 20 MIN LONG! NOT A REAL MOVIE: Full price for a 20 minute short? I feel ripped off. It was my fault for not reading the entire description, but I think the business model of this film relies on unwary customers like me.
1	Overall Very Good: The cinematography is breathtaking and the acting is great (except for Bergeron). Powerful story. Worth two bucks to rent on Youtube rentals.
1	fleece bone pillow: I love this pillow! I have had neck problems for years and this pillow has really been a lifesaver. It is so comfortable and has stopped me from waking with neck pain. I take it everywhere I go so I always get a good nights sleep. I would highly recoment this product to anyone but especially those with neck pain issues.
0	Uncomfortable: I was disappointed with this purchase. I had a neck-bone pillow for several years that was just wonderful. Unfortunately I left it at a hotel and wanted a replacement. This one was much wider at the spot where you would place you neck. The additional height made this pillow very uncomfortable to say the least. I would not recommend this to anyone. Wish I returned this the first day I got it.
0	The 8th Man episode is incomplete: I have fond memories of "Tobor the 8th Man" from the mid-60s and I wanted my 4-year-old son to experience the character. Since the quality of everything on this DVD is cr*p, that was all I was hoping to gain. It's hard to say whether I accomplished my goal or not. My son has learned the theme song, but still hasn't seen a complete episode.Is anyone aware of a DVD of the original series being available?My best friend has a theory why we no longer see this character on American TV: Ever notice the "funny cigarettes" he smokes when he needs to power up? HA!
0	Customer service: Hopkins EASYLIFT Tailgate EasyliftMy easylif broke after approx11 months. I read some of the customer reviews and learned that I am not the only one that has experienced this issue. The reason for my submitting this review is to inform others of the outstanding response I received from customer service. They are shipping me a new item and have provided me with a return shipping label for the broken item. GREAT SERVICE!!!
1	An exciting ride!: I enjoyed the development of the novel and found that I could not put the book down. I enjoy reading Tom Clancy novels, and I found this to be as exciting in plot development as Red Storm Rising. Courtney Suttle took me on a trill ride in this novel, and I highly recommend it. I hope that more people find this book and will learn what I have already found.I cannot wait until I the sequel is published. Get this book!!You will not be disappointed.
1	Another winner: My kids LOVE the Magic School Bus videos. The whole family has learned something, and the kids watch them over and over again.
0	Misleading material: I purchased this book after taking the029 test. I can honestly say that the "test questions" in this book bear very little resemblance to the questions on the actual test. The questions on the test are complex and difficult (often taking more 4 screens to present), while the sample questions in this book are just too simple.The actual test is much more weighted toward practical how-to, and toward interpretation of complex t-sql scripts. The MS Press "SQL Server 7.0 Database Implementation Training Kit" is much closer to the mark, but still not adequate.More to the point is MS Press "Inside SQL Server 7.0." In order to pass the test, spend a lot of time examining t-sql and thinking about how to use SQL profiler. The real test is about SQL practice, and not about the "2-minute drills" that this author seems to think are important.
0	Uh uh, son.: Sorry about tomorrow? How about sorry for this unlistenable cd. Pick up something on Saddle Creek instead. Word.
0	Big Let-Down: The whole idea of the book is fasinating; I bought it without any recommendations because it sounded interesting. I kept hoping there would be a wonderful ending to tie all of the scattered writing together, but the ending was even more disappointing than the rest of the book. Don't waste your time.
0	Mostly disappointing: This is a somewhat well written book. Character development and dialogue are much better than in DaVinci Code. The plot is weak, however. The part of the plot set in the former USSR might sound OK to a westerner, but to me, a Russian native, most of it sounds na?ve and poorly researched. You might like this book if you believe in magic, alchemy and easy to convince in general. Otherwise read Umberto Eco.
1	Farm Torch: This is a really great tool. It burns hot, but is easy to regulate. It is of good quality construction and pretty rugged. I used it to burn dead weeds and grass. It will also incinerate green weeds if you leave it on them for a few seconds. Finally, the long orange hose eliminates the need to buy a dolly to transport the fuel tank. Be careful using the trigger mechanism (not necessary to use it). It causes the torch to go into after-burner mode, something like a rocket launch.
1	Fiesta Napkins: FIESTA.....what's not to love? These are great, wash & dry well and attractive to boot!
0	Price increase, not good for business: Formula, 5 stars! New price,1 star! Like the rest, off to Costco.
1	Art and Pharmaceuticals: An astounding, out of print collection of 42 reproductions, published in the Dutch pharmaceutical calendars, with an introduction by Dr. D. A. Wittop Koning, Pharmacist at Amsterdam. Full color pictures will be interesting to both pharmacists and artists alike. One-of-a kind books.
1	Great!! a must buy if you are going to pass: I just took the network essentials exam and passed with room to spare. The book took what I had learned in the McBook (Microsoft Press Book), and extented it to a "what I need to know". I have never worked in networking and this is the first time taking the exam.
0	The manga is better.: The anime would probably only appeal to fans of the original manga (comic.) For those not in the know, Kimera should be refered to as "he" rather than "she." I am not surprised the english released changed it to "she." though.Not being fluent in Japanese, I can only guess at the plot, but the manga is fun to look at.
0	KIMERA is and anime joke!: This is the most horrible Anime I'v ever seen! DONOT buy this tape! It has an excellent cover but the story and drawings where worse than bad! I only rented this movie thank god, and its a bad Vampire movie about Vampires from outter space. The women Kimera, looks horrible! When shown naked, which isnt even needed, she has a chest liek a male, nothing at all! Just a flat chest!
1	Woolf's last novel: Between the Acts (BtA) was Woolf's last novel, finished but not yet revised before her death in1941. It is, like Woolf's other novels, experimental. She takes some of her already established techniques and adds new things. She sets it in the span of a single day (i.e. Mrs Dalloway), depicts and parodies historical events (i.e. Orlando). Woolf centers the action around a village play (a bad play, but that is part of the fun). The social commentary on Britain is there, but BtA is far from the "usual British stuff." In the course of the novel the reader should look at the actors and the audience, drawing parallels to our own daily acting. Woolf includes a number of literary allusions. See if you can find the use of Gerard Manley Hopkins in the narrative, for example. As with Woolf's other writings, plot is not the focus. Even though she died thinking it was unsuitable for publication (she was mistaken), BtA is a fine novel from a master writer.
1	Pretty good.: I still liked this book but there is other chicken soup books that are more interesting, such as the first book of the teenage soul. I just wasn't as touched as the other books. But I'm still glad i bought this book, and I'm going to buy the third book. I suggest that you might want to read some of this from the library to see for yourself if you think it's worth buying before hand.
0	Doesn't compare to the first "Teenage Soul" book: I recieved both books for my birthday, the1st on my15th and the 2nd on my16th. I read the1st one at least 4 times front to back in about 3 months. I'm very sorry to say that the 2nd is no where near as good as the1st. I got it in November now it's almost the end of January and still haven't finished it! It doesn't keep my attention like the1st one did. I recomend spending your money on something more interesting.
1	Sad, sad, sad!: Every time I read a Chicken Soup book, I end up crying my eyes out... not just while reading, but for hours afterwards. It's a great book, but the stories are just too sad.
1	A paper best-friend: To put it succinctly, this book and the stories within it have become one of my constant companions, a place to go for advice, understanding, and inspiration. It has comforted me in my lows and shared my highs. All in all, a very useful tool for a girl experiencing adolescent turmoil.
1	Almost better than the first book!: I stayed up all night reading that book and even if I almost fell asleep in class the next day i consider it well worth my time, it was the best book I had read in along time and it helped me alot. My thanks to all of the writers.
1	Nothing lacking: I'm satisfied with the brightness, like the design. The mounting bracket seems a little flimsy/questionable, but other than that, it seems fine. And unlike some florescent fixtures I've seen, this one is instant-on. No waiting when you flip the switch.Suggestion to the manufacturer...make the switch a little bigger and easier to "feel for" when the fixture is mounted out-of-sight.
1	I love Willie.: I may wear out the CD just by playing it while in the car. The lyrics are so amusing and just fit the two singers and their life style.
0	Bummer: Arrived with the thermometer broken off from base. Could not return because of the liquid used in the themometer. =( Looks and feels cheap.
0	Don't bother with this brand: I ordered one of these buggers and noticed a couple of defects.1- it was incredibly low powered and 2- there was no difference in power level from switch 4 to 5. Amazon was kind enough to send me a replacement. The new one is a bit more powerful, but I honestly think this brand is no good. I have ordered the tlc space vibe version many times and have never had an issue. Amazon, I hope you discontinue carrying this specific product. Your customers are trying to give you some good advice.
0	Couldn't watch: I started trying to watch this and couldn't get more than 20 minutes in. Others my find it a good movie, but it was hard for me to enjoy. Other similar titles I like are Alfie, Californication, Fight Club, Choke, etc.
0	RoboHelp 2000 for HTML Help: I was greatly disappointed with this book. It is poorly organized, and unclear. It takes an application that should be learned fairly easily and makes it that much harder.When there are multiple ways of doing the same thing, the author lists them in a numbered list which leads you to believe there are mulitple steps involved. Here's one example:"Creating a New Window""To create a new window, you perform the following steps:1. Select File, New, Window. 2. Right-click over the Windows folder on the Project tab. 3. Select File, Project Settings. Select the Windows tab and then click New."These are listed as 3 steps, but in fact are just 3 different ways of doing the same thing.This is just one illustration of poor organization within this entire book.
1	Underappreciated WWII fiction of Panzer Grenadiers on the Eastern Front: Really good fictional account of a squad of Panzer Grenadiers as they fight to survive on the Eastern Front during WWII. This guy was actually a Panzer Grenadier on the Eastern Front during WWII and by the descriptions you can believe it.This author also wrote "Panzer Grenadiers" which is slightly better well known, but this is the better out of the two books. Well spent money if you enjoy WWII and war related fiction.
0	Collapse by Jared Diamond: the picture led me to believe that this was the CD set that I was listening to from the library.It may be my own fault that i didn't pay attention when ordering that I bought a condensed version.Be careful if buying this that you don't buy this disappointing set.
0	Pretty Basic: There is a lot of the author's rantings about big business and mining in his state. His ranting went on for nearly100 pages, then he goes on to talk about the fall of societies that were doomed from the start. I could have made the analysis that he made about the specific societies that he picked. Personally I was dissipointed that he did not get into idealistic reasons why some societies fail. I would have liked to see more about why very technilogically advanced societies failed throughout history.
1	Five ways Civilizations Die - We are working on it: An excellent book that details the various ways those civilizations can collapse. He studies civilizations that have collapsed, and extrapolates.
0	Surprised at how bad this was: Jared Diamond can type a lot of words, but he says very little. Much of the info is repetitive and rote as you can skim through all the historical chapters without missing anything. As others have noted, Diamond's failing is that he makes broad assumptions without evidence early on and it corrodes his credibility from the start. Overall, a terrible book I recommend you skip. Read the summary and you'll know enough to save your money.
0	Plates missing from the Kindle edition: This (excellent) book comes with two sets of images:1) maps of the places where the different societies mentioned lived (Easter Island, Australia, Greenland, China, etc.) and 2) Sets of plates with 40 or so additional photos. The maps are included in the Kindle edition, although they don't look too god. The screen resolution is too small, so they look very, very blurry and the text in the maps is utterly unreadable. I uploaded a couple of screen grabs so you can judge for yourselves. Can anyone read the names of those tiny little islands? Thank God we have Google Earth. As for the plates mentioned in the text, well, they ain't there at all. That's a sloppy digitalizing job, Penguin.
1	Important, but challenging reading: Jared Diamond is my hero, one of a small group of writers who've drastically impacted the way I view the world. And this book *feels* important and like something I should want to read ... but I'm struggling. I read a chapter, then put it down in favor or something else. Still working through it. I don't mean to say it's tedious, just not quite as engaging and thought-provoking as I found Diamond's other works to be. I loved The Third Chimpanzee, and Guns, Germs, and Steel is one of the most important books ever written. So buy this, own it, reference it, but don't expect to be wowed by it.
0	Interesting, but Halting: An interesting book, I found myself reading and rereading entire passages. Not only because I enjoyed the text, but also because the translation was sometimes so awkward that I had trouble making sense of some sections. Perhaps the next edition will be better produced.
0	A lot of phaff and only directX 5.2: First and foremost this book was written when directX 5 was the standard. Now we are up to 7/8 and I assume there have been many changes, at least there are some examples in the DirectX 7 SDK which use functions not covered in this book. The lack of complete code examples or exercies means this is definately not a tutorial and there are no tables to indicate it is a reference book. In fact, the book seems to be a collection of ramblings about directX and computer graphics in general. Maybe this was never intended to be a reference or a tutorial, but either would have probably been more useful.
0	Chasing Ghosts from an Invented Past: Hongo delights us with his poetic voice and I was expecting big things with this memoir. But doesn't a 'memoir' mean you've spent some meaningful time in a locale and are a bit of an expert on it? Hongo left Hawaii for California at a young age and knows little if anything about the history of the aina. His spiritual angle on looking at a leaf, stream, or hardened lava flow is somewhat interesting but the book lacks any meaningful punch because there is little or no characterization. I was expecting him to reconnect with people from his childhood but there are none. He is chasing ghosts from an invented past and the writing suffers for it.
0	Disappointing!: I don't like this book at all. A pity as it is well-written, with vivid turn of phrases Miss Laurens obviously applied painstakingly and lovingly. I like honoria, she is strong, independent and intelligent. I just don't like the hero Devil.Devil is the most stubborn donkey I have ever met! He is infuriatingly mulish, not telling Honoria anything, making decisions for her, and making me exasperated in the process. I envision a lifetime of saucepan for them both - Honoria will need a lot of them to beat some sense into this dolt.
1	TO COMPLETE YOUR GIORDANO COLLECTION: AMAZING. TWO UNKNOWN OPERATIC JEWELS FOR THE PRICE OF ONE. FIRST; LIVE PERFORMANCES THAT ARE ACTUALLY WELL RECORDED, WITH GOOD, CLEAN, CLEAR SOUND. SECOND, SINGERS THAT ARE UNIFORMLY EXCELLENT, GREAT ORCHESTRA AND CONDUCTOR. THIRD: THE MERE FACT THIS MUSIC HAD NOT BEEN PLAYED FOR SO LONG, AND QUITE UNDESERVEDLY SO. "MESE MARIANO", THOUGH ONLY 35 MINUTES LONG, PACKS AN EMOTIONAL PUNCH AS STRONG AS A THREE ACT TEAR-JERKER. BRAVO GIORDANO!!!!!!!!!!
1	cannabis growing: This is the most comprehensive guide that I have seen on growing cannabis. A must for any one serious about growing marijuana or curious of the process.
1	5 Stars: Amazing work, everything a grower ever needs to know. If your interested in knowing how it is grown and how people imprOve the quality of the plant, then this book is for you.
0	New York Times Crossword Puzzle Dictionary: The book arrived promptly, packaged very well. Not in as good condition as I expected but my fault for ordering a used book.
1	The best product for crosswords.: This is my second copy of The New York Times Crossword Puzzle Dictionary. I am replacing the first copy that I have worn completely out from constant use. I have over the years found no better assistance for crosswords than this product.
0	Disappointing: The potential for this to have been truly great is lost by the focus of the film. If you are not familiar with Mr. Carey's remarkable work, this will not supply too much evidence. The acting is fair. The actors who play Mr. Carey and the first Mrs. Carey are just not up to the roles. There is a bit of underacting and overacting here. What a shame that such an important story could not have been told better.
1	EMDR: This is a must have book for those using EMDR, particularly if you are new at the process. This would be the second book to buy after the basic text. It helps the new therapist see and appreciate how the therapeutic relationship is central to the use of eyemovement. It is well written and makes much clear.
1	Nice, Barely Used Cookbook: Minus some very minor damage marks on the cover, the book is like new. All pages are clean and intact.
0	For Programming Novices Only: This is for beginners only. Examples and explainations are very simplistic and do not provide the detail necessary for creating a real world messaging application. Much effort is expended providing information on using the Visual Basic IDE and on creating a UI. The code examples also demonstrate poor programming practices. I would not recommend this book to anyone. If you would like a good MSMQ reference buy Designing Applications with MSMQ by Alan Dickman. It is not perfect but is the most comprehensive text on MSMQ that I have read so far.
1	Never an IPOD believer..now I'm sold: I have never been a believer in the IPOD before. Always seemed to fragile and too expensive. I had a Creative Labs Zen that was sturdy...took abuse...but heavy...a bit cumbersome. I saw the Nano and immediately checked it out. Was I wrong about Apple. This Nano is amazing. I had it for less than 2 hours and put about 400 songs and more than 200 clear, sharp pictures on it. I'm sold! Also, all those folks who advise how this thing scratches, etc. I don't buy it. I've thrown this around my car, my pocket..all over the place. It shows some fingerprints, but that's about it. No scratches, no broken screens, nothing except cystal clear sound a crystal clear display. I love my IPOD Nano. Great job Apple!
0	BATTERY SUCKS: So I was the first kid on the floor with the IPOD NANO, I orderedone from MAC the Monday of release.It arrives, we all OOOOH and AHHHHHI take it home and charge it for the nightWake up at 5:30, fully charged battery, put it onand get on with my day, by10 AM the battery had DIEDCRAP!I call up MAC and they want to REPAIR this oneI say HELL NO! I just BOUGHT it, I am not sending this backfor you to REFURBISH it, I want a new one, and you screwedup my inscription, too.....So I am getting ready to mail this back, when I charge thebattert ONE more time, all night charge, fresh in the AMThis time, it stayed on from 7:30, when I started to use it until1:26PM, an hour ago, my NANO died from poor battery power.Watch out when you get these, I am going to return this and hopeI get a better one, if I get another POOR BATTERY, I am goingto get a freaking refund, this is BOGUSMAC should know better than to release a product that is crap:/
1	ipod nano 4gb-white: I love the ipod nano. It started when my friend got one, so I did to. I just got it today, and listening to it right now (Everclear- Father of Mine) and I LOVE IT. The case that comes with it is OK for now.I recommend getting the largest version (Max storage)
1	It's an iPod --- what more do you say?: I am giving it a 4 due to the simple fact of battery replacement. I am not looking forward to the day that it simply doesn't hold a charge anymore. But, I am confident that by that time, some 3rd party smartie will have an aftermarket battery solution. Keeping my fingers crossed....
0	Won't work with Windows: Don't waste you hard earned cash on this if you plan on using it with MS Windows. Windows recognizes the iPod but Apple iTunes does not. After 32 hours of trying to get it to work, I'm giving up. My expience tells me that Apple still doesn't play well with PC's.
0	No customising!: I should have paid more attention to the title. It's called "Administering" SAP R/3 and not "Customising". It explains how to use the different SD functions not how to implement them. Unfortunately, it cannot be recommended to users either because it is too technical and does not explain things in a comprehensive manner. There are some books that emphasise the business process and help you decide how to implement this in SAP. This is not one of them. This book is smack in the middle of a no-mans land. It's no good for customising, no good for users and no good for planning business processes.I totally agree with some of the other reviewers. Your better off with the online documentation.Save your bucks. Don't waste them on this book.Incidently, if your looking for a book on SD customising, I can recommend "Implementing SAP Sales and Distribution": 5 stars!
1	A National Treasure: This double CD is stuffed full of great songs and amazing stories. My favorite stories are of Elaine's date with Marlon Brando, what she thought some lyric are/meant, and her time in Compant. The total honesty that she brings it all together is touching and inspiring.Very few people have the length or variety of a career that Elaine Stritch has had. I am sure that she has enough stories to do ten more shows.If you love Broadway then you must buy this CD.
0	Disappointing!: This book was so disappointing! It lacked applicability to using the Active Directory.
1	Comfort food and reading...: The recipes in "The Country Gourmet" spin a tale of comfort as well as good eats. The remembrances of the author's mama and her love of food and life does more than feed the reader's soul, it gives the reader hope that there is truly more to life than getting out of bed each day; there are wonderful dishes to prepare and delicious people to get to know and break bread together with. TWO THUMBS way up for this amazingly inspiring cookbook/biography chronicling a daughter's love for her mother and her mother's cooking.
0	It had it's good moments: I'm not sure what to say about this book, I THINK i liked it... it's about a woman who wants to start out somewhere new, and on the way she gets a daughter and meets people... I wish turtle had said more... Barbara seems to ramble on and on... I'm not even sure if i would recommend it... I THINK i would...
1	A thrilling life size novel.: This book was great. I was actually made to read this over the summer. When I first looked at it, and a first glance at the title, I thought I was in for a interesting trip in my imagination world.Then I read the back and relized that it wasn't going to be all that bad. I read the book and loved it! I fell in love with the charaters. I sypmathized for the dilemmas they all went through in their lives. It proved that with out really putting yourself in someone elses shoes, you can't correctly judge your own life.
1	An Exciting Read: Unique in that the narrator and heroine, Taylor/Marietta isn't the typical flawed protagonist who learns self-confidence by getting a makeover or landing her dream man. In this book, Taylor already has a self-confidence that borders on cockiness and is full of spunk. She's a sweet, straight-talking narrator the reader grows to love. Her frankness is something readers will aspire to. Taylor travels to Tucson, takes charge of a young Native American girl, befriends and encourages an insecure new mother named Lou Ann, and meets Estevan and Esperanza, a couple from Guatamala living illegally in the states. The novel has a feminist slant, and is empowering that way. I got a bit bored with the subplot featuring Estevan and Esperanza, but for the most part was captivated. Told in the voice of Taylor, the novel is humorous and uplifting. The conversations are realistic and familiar, very real. Brimming with advice and inspiration.
1	Extraordinary!: Even a voracious reader (such as myself) can sometimes be unaware of a new voice in the land....I was unaware of Barbara Kingslover, until about a month ago, when a friend of mine handed me a copy of "The Bean Trees," mentioning that I "might like it."To say that I "liked" it is extreme understatement ... This is a book I wish I had written....It's all about the beauty, the glory, the heartaches, the joys, and the realities of being a woman alive in the world today -- without heavy-handed political harangues or in-your-face proselytizing. Instead, this book is filled with wisdom, warmth, out-loud laughs and a quiet, satisfying inner recognition of all that is truly wonderful in a woman's mind, spirit, heart and life.I've found a friend in Ms. Kingslover. I wish she lived next door
0	It's all down hill from the Poisonwood Bible.: The first book I read of Barbara Kingsolver's was The Poisonwood Bible. It was so good that I decided to read more of her stuff. Unfortunately, it's all down hill from there folks. Poisonwood is fabulous and I've not found her other books to be any where near as good. In fact I read The Bean Trees a few months ago and I really can't remember much about it. Barbara Kingsolver is a talented writer, but this one just didn't hit the mark for me.
0	Asimple REVIEW of us, ROger Ling, RAymond Gao,& Jonathan Bau: Dear Friends, WE have read this book, and other reviews, and WE have made a conclusion for myself. This book is a visionary, it leaves you open mouthed and sleeping (drooling too.)... although it seems to contain good topics such as friendship and love in the book, it is SO scrambled that the book turns into a jumbling piece of literature. The book contains random events that have nothing to do with each other, yet somehow Barbara Kingsolver uses extremely bad writing and a strong Tucson accent to tie all the events together. All in all, WE,Roger Ling, RAymond Gao, and Jonathan Bau appreciate the hard effort that Kingsolver put into this "interestingly unique" book, but next time she wants to write another book alike this one, we shall say, "Thanks, but no thanks. Think of the future generations." P.S. WE were unable to finish the book due to the book's lack of quality.
0	H8ted it: I thought that it was really boring, and the struggles that a lot of the characters overcame weren't really that intersesting. I thought that Taylor didn't bother to look at the world from any point of view but her own and was obnoxious. I also hated her friend and I pretty much thought that the only reason that the people's lives were as bad as they were is because they didn't try to improve it with everything they had. They were too clingy. And the entire Talor kissing the married guy really stupid and unsensitive on her part.
1	AN ENJOYABLE READ: This is a story about a Taylor - a young woman who leaves her small Kentucky town and heads west - hoping to make something of her life. In her travels, Taylor's handed a 3 year old American Indian girl who, it's clear, has been heiniously abused. When there's no trace of this child's parents, Taylor takes on the role, and by the time the two land in a small town outside Tuscon, Arizona, for all intents and purposes, Taylor is the child's mother.Written in wise and lyrical prose, this story is about loyalty in love and friendship, and about discovering how far in life these treasures can take you.
0	A very disappointing read.: The Bean Trees attempts to address so many vital issues: adoption, class and race, youth, feminism, yet these remain a shallow, new-age background. When Taylor finally appears to break down under the pressure of young motherhood, it rings false, her switch from bravado to frustration lacks depth and disappears as quickly as Kingsolver's references to the war in Guatamala.
0	Interesting, but poorly explained technique: I found myself rereading several times to try to understand how his "box theory" works. The author does an extremely poor job of explaining the most important part of the book as is evident by the questions posed by other readers in the Appendix. He focuses too much on the story and not enough on the technique.
0	Don't Waste Your Money: This book is an autobiography of Nicolas Darvas' life. There is nothing describing in clear detail the system he used and how he used it. Nicholas gained most of his money when he bought a cheap stock on a wim for maybe 5 or10 dollars and it magically shot up in price overnight and was restricted from anymore trading. He sold one stock that magically shot up for171 dollars a share, profit 250,000. I don't even think the results he posted were real. The most information you gain from this book is to buy stocks in a strong uptrend and that info is nothing new.
0	Entertaining but not enough details: I got this book based on so many 5-star reviews posted here. This book is indeed entertaining for leisure reading. However, it lacks the much more practical details in explaning what the techo-fundamental method he used is all about. The book did provide some basic advice on implementing stop-loss, limit buy, etc, to limit the risk. However, these are all very basic elements of trading that all the traders should learn in the first chapter of trading. In other words, the book only covered the story (and some stock trading101) which do not teach readers (especially the very beginners) what practical set-ups or methods are used to be profitable in trading stocks. This book is good if you are looking for a non-textbook leisure reading. If you are looking for trading methods (either technical or fundamental) that can help you to be better in trading, I think the "Mastering the Trade" by John Carter is by far the most practical book that I found in the market.
0	hope for the stupid: This book illustrates that if someone as stupid as Nicholas Darvas can make money in the stock market so can you.After all, it took this guy several years after he began trading to figure out what the Dow Jones Industrial Average was.Essentially, Darvas used fundamental analysis in conjunction with"stocks that were moving" and placed trailing stops behind them. Darvas never shorts a stock. The concept would probably be too taxing for his brain.Not a bad system. It supposedly worked for him.In my opinion,their are a few, and only a few, good ideas which can be gleaned from this essentially worthless book.
0	One of the VERY WORST!: This is one of the worst books I have ever read. The actual investing technique the author used is explained in less than half a page at the end of the book. The rest of the book is just piles of completely useless and irrelevant stories about the authors travel and adventures that have absolutely nothing to do with his technique or investing.The technique explained at the end of the book is one of the most basic techniques in Technical Analysis (TA). In the TA terminology, it is called support and resistance levels. If you are interested in this technique, use one of the books on TA. Those books cover it in much more rigor than Darvas' book and they cover a lot more TA techniques that are much more powerful. My favorite book on TA is "How Technical Analysis Works" by Bruce Kamich.
0	False advertising - avoid: Amazon claims "training DVD to teach you all the features & functions & HOW TO USE & MAXIMIZE your Garmin unit". What can I tell you? There are many many features and functions that are not mentioned at all. I have told Amazon to modify this claim and of course I am retuning it to them.
1	One of many great anime: Im13 years old and I love this anime.Why, not because of the action,but but because of its mystery,drama, and deph.Most of my friends loved the action,but they really never understood the concept of this anime.They just kept talking about it.It got me and other people annoyed by it.It made anime sound geeky and people started sterotyping the show and other anime.The show can get confusing at times but starts to come together like a big puzzle.Like the other anime on catoonnetwork people got only half of what the anime could of been because they wanted to make the show for kids.This show isn't always seriouse.It has a lot of funny moments in it.If you liked this I reccomend buying Trigun.
1	A Must Have, Indeed: While some may call the great reviews given to this anime "rants" and such, they're more than that. Outlaw Star is, to say the least, an anime that deserves to be placed on the shelf along with others hits such as Cowboy Bebop, Trigun, Gundam Wing, etc. The fact of the matter is that it's entertaining, has a storyline that grabs the viewer, and characters which one can become familiar with. People who find Outlaw Star not enough to be considered worth owning usually don't look at it for what it is. Entertainment. The anime borderlines between being entertaining and 'deep'. Because of this it gets alot of good reviews, and then some so-so and bad ones. But don't be mistaken, it IS a wonderful anime.
1	Great...: This show is my fav Anime series... its even my first..it has a killer story and very like-able charactors....
0	WHY??!WHY?!?!WHY?!?!: Why did they do this? why did they make a direct to video sequel to a movie that made money?It screams for a big screen sequel that starts off where the original ended.not a flick that takes a simple premise and dumbs it down,and cant pull off the decent vampire body burns achieved in the original.The thing that was cool about the original was that the vampire slayers were meaner than the monsters they hunted.In this one they are weak and it becomes your average cheap vamp flick.not to mention carpenters good name wasted on the box.And whats with that awful wooden steak gun bon jovi uses,its sad.this vampire flick sucks.
0	Definitely not Carpenter's best..: Definately not one of Carpenter's (who I am not a huge fan of anyway) best; it was written very lazily & directed (and acted) badly. Maybe it was the stupid/lame title, or maybe the boring plot. Either way, I didn't take much with me except the setting...and Bon Jovi & Diego Luna's prettiness. You know a movie isn't all that good when all that stands out are the looks of the main characters!
1	Come on....it wasn't that bad.: The movie wasn't as horrible as some make it out to be. It surely wasn't "the worst vampire movie ever". Jon Bon Jovi didn't suck in the roll either.
0	0 STARS: Los Feces: Jon Bon Jovi should definitely stick to singing because he's a horrible actor, but that does not even begin to describe how terrible "Vampires- Los Muertos" is...as horrible of an actor as Jon Bon Jovi may be, "Vampires-Los Muertos" is an even worse movie. Vampires, that's a laugh...this movie has a terrible plot and the acting is even worse. The original "Vampires" sucked too, but this one is even worse folks! Definitely one of the worst so called "horror" movies of all-time and that my friends is saying something!! Can you believe some people call this a horror movie...well, you can imagine what I call it...yes sir, I just call it rubbish and that's being very kind.
0	Dont quit your day job...: Dont waste the money on this stinker. Jon, stick to your day job of rocking teenage girls and middle-aged housewives. This is supposedly some sort of sequal to Carpenter's "Vampires" which totally rocked, Los Muertes is nowhere near being in the same league. Obviously an excuse for Bon Jovi's female fans to see Jon with his shirt off unfortunatly guys there are no gratutious female bod-shots for us to make this movie worth-while. Forget the fact that the plot jumps around so much that you give up trying to understand it and just pray that it somehow gets better before you fall asleep. Take some advice and rent it like I did. Especially if there is nothing else you would rather do than numb your mind.
0	Justin and the Best Biscuits in the WorldJP: I Didn`t like it because it makes me feel bad when I read about responsibility. It is also about family value and I like that. So, I give this book three stars.
1	Justin and the Best Biscuits in the WorldEF: I really,really thought this was awsome because they talk about cowboys and roping.I am not like Justin.I hate the night riders.I don't like his sisters because they were mean.So were the night riders.The Q-T ranch is cool.Justin's Grandpa is nice.Justin likes going to his Grandpa's.He likes to ride horses.One time they found a fawn in the fence!Luckly they got it out.Then they went to the festival.Justin makes a new friend.He Deos 4 actvities.He has fun.And Grandpa won the "Best Biscuits in the World"
0	great music, bad video: If you like the music of Pablo Montero, only buy this if you are a collector, it only has 6 songs, very bad extras and the videos seem to be very bad TV grabbing, lousy video quality. Not worthy of Pablo Montero. Looks like the music company who gave permission to publish this really does not care about a basic standard of quality
0	Not for those just starting ms sql server or ms in general: I was presented this book and told 'learn how to set up sql server'. Not from this. Aside from grammatical problems that make it hard to read, it presumes you know all the ms-isms, the microsoft way of naming or doing things (my15+ years experience is on other systems). Of several dozen attempts to locate a term or item in the index, none were successful. Best guess; if you know an older sql server, or are well immersed in ms and its methodologies, this book might be useful to learn V7. If not, look elsewhere.
1	Strange and wonderful: Another great postmodern version of a Renaissance play by director Alex Cox. THE REVENGER'S TRAGEDY is comparable to Julie Taymor's TITUS (Shakespeare's Titus Andronicus) or Derek Jarman's EDWARD II (the Marlowe play). The dialogue is based on the original language of Thomas Middleton's play, but the setting and action are futuristic. The movie is actually pretty faithful to an extremely bizarre play, which includes incest, necrophilia, murder, poison, and you name it. Apparently the 21st century has nothing on the late Renaissance when it comes to decadence. Christopher Eccleston gives a great performance as Vindici, the revenger character. There are a couple of scenes of lovemaking which don't technically include "nudity." There is also some violence, but what makes the play so shocking is the decadence of the characters and setting. Very darkly humorous and satirical.
0	Ideal for the Web developer new to the Microsoft tool set...: After reading "Professional Active Server Pages" and "Active Visual Basic 5.0", I felt like I was wasting my time with "Inside Microsoft Visual InterDev". The book is appropriate as an overview for an entry level Web developer that has had no experience with Microsoft development tools. At the very least, I would hope to see significant examples in future editions.
1	Baking Book That Takes The Cake!!!: This book is full of wonderful recipes that just prove that Maida Heatter is the expert on baking. I started off with the Zucchini bread, which is out of this world. I then tried the sticky buns. My family thought I bought them at a bakery. And they weren't that difficult. Anybody who has baked before will be able to complete them with ease. I recommend this book and her others to anyone who loves baked goods, especially cakes.
0	Magical shrinking leggings: These leggings were great out of the package. They fit perfectly and were very soft. However, after the first washing they shrunk quite a bit and the softness was lost. I wouldn't buy them again.
0	Big Fail: These leggings sit low on the waist, nothing like the pictures. Pitbull and American Apparel are both using this brand now called In Touch. The materical is thin but comfortable but the lowrise fit ruins them. I am a real woman and I need a little more material for my waist and back side.
0	Shrunk and See Through: These leggings shrink even when following garment care instructions.For this money the fabric should be of much better quality,they are see through.I doubt these will last.There are better choices.
1	Works for Me!: I've had these leggings for about 2 months now. I wash on gentle and hang dry (like I do all these types of things as it makes them last so much longer). They do sit a little below the waist, but that seems to be the current style and it's not too low. The legs are long which is great for me because most leggings are too short and then my ankles get cold. Not with these! I don't wear them barefoot, so don't know if the long length would be a problem. I really like the price, and they arrived quickly and in perfect condition. I wish I'd bought two of them as I sleep in them as well. Recommended.
1	Egg shaper: Bought this for my husband. I had a metal one but the eggs stuck to it. This one I thought it would melt but it doesn't and the eggs don't stick either. It's easy to clean. This one is a keeper.
1	WE WERE SOLDIERS: Sorry some people have been disappointed that this is not the soundtrack. But...the music is a perfect tribute to the film and the men portrayed there. I am a veteran and a close friend of Joe Galloway, Bruce Crandall and many more of the real life soldiers in the story. Randy Wallace did this album for them..and for all of us who have not had our songs sung. Listen to the words, they mean a lot to us.
0	Misleading: This "soundtrack" should have been titled "Music inspired by We were Soldiers" or something to that tune. If you want the actual score/ soundtrack of this film, you should look for the similarly titled album but COMPOSED by Nick Glennie-Smith. That CD is truly 5 star material.This album is not too bad in itself, if you are into 60ish songs but the misleading name is highly irritating and misleading hence I deduct one star from my true rating.
0	Excellent movie but very poor soundtrack album: The movie is one of the best Vietnam era movies I have seen but this soundtrack had only 2 songs on it that I recalled being in the movie. I wish I had saved my money and stuck with the movie instead of paying also for the soundtrack.
1	I LOVE this book!: I initially got Kathryn Marsden's little book on Food Combining which is a great beginner (explainer). This one goes into much more detail but still keeps everything so simple. Once you learn the premise, you can honestly create or adjust every recipe you already have and use. This book also gave information about medical conditions that respond favorably when we stop mixing all foods together at the same time. This information could help keep you out of the doctors office. My friend with diabetes is thriving on this program. You could honestly have more time, money and health to do what you really enjoy!
1	A real gem: Just as good as 'Silk Roads', music will immerse you in harmony. Great to study or meditate to, a real feeling of peace.
1	This album is a "OASIS" for kitaro-fans !: When I first came over this album for many years ago,I felt that this was MY kind of music!(this was the first I`ve ever heard from Kitaro)The music takes you away to dreamland,and you get SO relaxed..! (Beautiful!) from the very first note... Buy it,you will not regret!!!
1	brilliance.: crimes is absolutely the best album of the year, no questions asked. the BB have transcended all attempts to pigeon-hole them into a genre, and have brought a brilliant energy to the scene that buries everybody else. cant wait for an east coast show, its killing me! experimental genius. maximum ownage.
1	SCAN DISK SANSA MP3 PLAYER: THE ITEM BECAME DEFECTIVE AND AMAZON REPLACED THE ITEM WITH NO COST TO ME,
0	The dreaded STP error: It's amazing to me that there could be an MP3 player that allows one to corrupt it by simply uploading slightly more data that it shows. That's what happened. Pathetic. Playng volume is weak, the display is easily cracked, and now my son's player is a useless paperweight. I'll probably try to get it replaced, meanwhile I just bought anoter one. Search for "no space for Db please delete 4.0 Mbs to free up space" and just see how many hits you get. I really do have a hard time recommending ANY Sansa MP3 player when the very basic operation can render one useless; and it's not just this model, just search, and you'll see.
0	anything but an ipod: i got this b/c i was desperate for an ipod alternative, and it seemed to be a decent buy. my main complaint is that every few days it refuses to play songs that i've downloaded onto it from yahoo music player (it will still play songs i've transferred from CDs). when it does this it asks me to "plz sync the device". i still haven't figured out what that means. sometimes if i plug the device into my computer and alter the playlist a little, it's happy for another few days. sometimes this doesn't work. very frustrating. also, it operates on AAA batteries and sucks them down like water.
1	Great Value: I bought 2 of these for my daughters, who are 8 and12. (I feared that they might get lost at some point, and I didn't want to invest in a more expensive iPod.) The controls and menus are easy to use and I had no problems using Windows Media Player to load them. They love them and I think they're a great deal for the price.
0	OK if you ignore the FM abilities: I bought this player mainly for its FM recording abilities. I have an Ipod that i use for most everything in my library. So for under $100 i thought this would be great for what i needed. I was wrong. When the backlight turns off the sound on the FM is drown out by an annoying hum. This also travels over to recording. You can leave the backlight on all the time, but that will just eat power like no tommorow. Sadly disappointing becasue it seems this is the same on all this model not just the one I had. Dont by it for FM anything! Get a Creative Labs Zen Nano Plus like I did - cheaper & it works!
0	I was very unhappy: What can I say. I purchased not once but twice and not because I liked it. I first bought it about a month ago and was really happy with it and all of its features. However, after just one month it locked up on me and wouldn't do anything. I returned the item and thought maybe I just got a defective product and gladly replaced it with the same product. This however was a huge mistake since this one locked up on me after just one day. I returned the item and bought a completely different mp3 player. I hope this helps anyone who is potenially going to buy this product.
1	Excellent tutorial to Python language.: Learning Python fills the gap for a printed introduction to the Python language. The layout is natural and methodical. Although I had picked up a good deal of the material beforehand from the online documentation and trial and error use of Python, I learned quite a bit from the book that had previously escaped me. If you want to know what the buzz is about Python or are looking for an excellent introduction for friends and co-workers to Python, try Learning Python.
1	still a good read: Having read this book a couple of years ago, I still browse through it frequently. David presents a gentle intro for the Python beginner but I appreciate the quick summaries of modules and methods. In fact, I reference this book a lot more than my "Essential Python Reference". Buy this book for a good intro to the language and keep it around for future reference.
0	The Above Reviews are Phoney: It's some writer working under a pseudonym, getting writer-friends to write these horrible, long-winded reviews.
1	Rodan you bet: Rodan is a complete story. It includes people elements and the state of the arts special effects for the times. I have been looking for a clear copy of this film and this is it.
0	You've got to be kidding!!!!!!!!!!!!: This has to be the all time worst sci-fi flick since the mesozoic era. Poor acting. Poor directing. Poor scenery and effects...
0	Subtitles? Original Japanese language track? Didn't think so: I've always been a big fan of all the Toho monster movies and had been awaiting this DVD release with baited breath. Would this be the one to finally feature an option to watch the movie in Japanese with English subtitles? Evidently not. I'm tired of these great movies being reduced to cheap B flicks by virtue of awful dubbing, re-editing and the deletion of music cues. It's time they were seen as originally intended. I've been lucky enough to see subtitled copies of many of the Godzilla movies... all of them brilliant.But these tacky dubbed versions drain all the soul out of them... and are an insult to the great filmmaker's who put them together in the first place. I'm tempted to learn Japanese and buy the official Toho releases.
0	This book is not detailed enough.: You will find yourself refering to Novells website to get full explainations and instructions on how to do things refereced in the book. (thats unacceptable to me) I was disappointed with this purchase. Novells online manuals contain far more information and its free.
1	Ironpants for the people: The heavy denim material seems to wear really well and the workmanship is excellent. For a working man or for someone hard on pants, these are the jeans to buy, for they may last for many years. There are plenty of pockets, but the legs are a little baggy for the average-built person, still they look really nice.Hard-core denim wearers, here are the jeans for you!
0	Not Nearly So Good As I Had Hoped: After reading "Generation X' and "Shampoo Planet" I was somewhat dissappointed by this effort. The angst of the central character as a tortured father separated from a child is understandable but maudlin at times. There is something of Coupland's earlier style in the book. The childhood reminiscence of the central character recalls the author's work in "Generation X" and was much appreciated. The book on the whole is not the pleasure to read that his two previous works were.
1	Insightful: Thought provoking. I would expect nothing less from Douglas Coupland. He has his own unique way at looking at the world and it comes across clearly in this book
1	Catcher in the Rye, 20 years on...: This book is for anyone who has reached that point in their life where they question whether there is any logic to the seemingly random series of memories they have aquired thus far. The magic of this book is missed by the editorial reviews. If you read Catcher in the Rye and then grew up, it's time to read this.
1	These are our children!: How many books can you honestly say made you cry? I cried over these "letters" from young people trying to get a college education. They have seen such terrible violence and yet they find ways to write their hearts out for two splendid teachers, Michael Blitz and C. Mark Hurlbert. How do I know they are splendid teachers? I can only say you would have to read this book to understand. Michael and C. Mark write letters to each other, to their children, to themselves, too, I think. There is so much that is beautiful in this book that it's strange to say, also, that there is so much that is horrifying. I wanted a book about teaching that would offer something "different." This book offered me an experience that is unforgettable.
0	so horrible we couldn't endure it, only lasted 4 mintues, so boring: This is not words we are used to hearing. TOO many words, unknown words, Agatha gone mad. love to return this.?? Beth
0	Hackneyed magic realism: Hackneyed magic realism - kitsch and cliche.The cover of this edition features a quote from Marquez:"...unmistakeable reading pleasure."Surely the complete quote must be something along the lines of:"Even Stefan Zweig, in comparison, inspires unmistakeable reading pleasure."Read The Lizard's Tail by Valenzuela or Ship of Fools by Peri Rossi instead. Leopard in the Sun is unmistakeably dispensable.
1	Dali produces a little gem: I saw a Dali exhibition of his art in Melbourne Australia in june09. Amongst the exhibits was a 7 minute dvd of a surrealist love fantasy which Dali made in collaboration with Walt Disney productions.This film is a whimsical lyrical glide through Dali's surrealist world. Truly a little gem.I also saw some of his ink and pencil drawings.They depict a technical mastery which has been compared to that of DaVinci. Most great artists are masters of drawing.You won't be disappointed with "Destino".
0	Junk: Mine was dead out of the box. Hey America, you get what you pay for - there is no free lunch. On its' way back, needless to say.
1	Texas slice of life: Set in a rural Texas town near the end of WW I, the flu epidemic of that year is raging. The movie attempts to capture, in great detail, the tribulations of a family at this period of time: the war in Europe, the influenza, and their everyday routines. Death seems everywhere. A great deal of trouble went into getting the details of the setting absolutely authentic. It's a poignant movie, and we can identify and feel for the characters: the husband (William Converse-Roberts) and wife (Hallie Foote) who lose their 8-month-old child to the flu, and the17-year-old brother (Matthew Broderick) who wants nothing but to go fight in Europe before it's all over. A very real slice of life, with few, if any, of the Hollywood conventions one might expect. Written by Horton Foote. Worth a watch.
0	Possibly the worst Godzilla film made: This sequel to Godzilla Vs. Mechagodzilla makes its predecessor look like Oscar material. Godzilla doesn't appear in this movie until mid-way through it. When he finally does show up, Godzilla seems to pop-up out of nowhere to do battle with Titanosaurus, one of the worst movie monsters that I have ever seen.Being a rabid Godzilla fan, I looked forward to watching this movie. Unfortunately, even my five year old son did not like this installment in the Godzilla series.Poor plot. Poor villains. Poor effects. Not enough Godzilla.Don't waste your time & money on this one.
1	A Must read for students of all ages: Well-written with rich universal themes, this book is a must read, especially for the classroom.
1	Fantastic!: I LOVE this book! I thought about it for weeks after I first read it. This is most definitely worth a read. I learned a lot about Jewish culture that I had never known before and about people in general. I must admit that the book started getting a bit boring when they went into depth about certain things, mainly because sometimes the author went on for pages...but other than that, the book was very, very good.
1	The Chosen:Understanding: in reading "The Chosen" i was very pleased with the book. The plot was very touching as we saw the boys (Danny and Reuven) grow from the grounds of a baseball field to the advanced college campus. Their friendship was very strong and was normally able to overcome most obstacles...except for the silence that Danny and Reb Saunders had between them. Mr. Malter brought Rueven up in talking, so Rueven began to hate the silence simply because he couldn't understand it. i believe that that applies to much of life. If we don't understand something completely, we tend to write it off as bad, hard, or tend to hate it. i would highly recommend this book for anyone looking for a good book for any occasion.
0	Over Exaggerated!!: This book is based on teenagers. In todays society children can not relate to the characters of this book, The Chosen. I believe that I should have enjoyed this book a lot more if I were able to understand what the characters were going through emotionally. I felt the author would help me understand, unfortunatly this is not the case. When I first heard of this book, I thought I would like it, because I too am Jewish. As I started to read it though, I felt as though it were extremely boring. I was hoping for it to be abook were I wouldn't want to put it down. but as I found out I would simply try anything to aviod it. I hope others readers have abetter feeling about this book, and it enjoyed it
1	A superb story: 'The Chosen' is a story of friendship that considers and is impacted by the relevancy of an ancient faith in a modern world and the clash between the different ways of approaching such faith. The debates within the book hold particular interest for religions in which faith tends to also become a culture and lifestyle. Potok vividly presents both the joys and the frustrations associated with such religious culture. The story is beautifully told, the portrayal of Jewish culture fascinating and the issues discussed are challenging.
1	a great example of the struggle for zionism in the1940's: ok, the book may focus on the relationship between two young Jews, but the main theme they they are in conflict by, as their father show, is Israel. A state now, in1948, on only when the Messiah comes and says so. BEIng Jewish and living in a traditional family that obseveres customs that both boys do, i fully understand the conflict and was fascinated by how well a person who knows nothing about Judiasm can learn so much. I had the honor to meet Chaim potok and he said he wrote it back in1950 to show his support for zionism and how two people who are the same yet so different can cope together. They are both trying to keep the Promise. Read this and it's sequel. Both are simplely-written but powerful in meaning. DONT WAIT TILL YOU GET IT FOR YOUR READING LIST!
1	He reads very slowly: I like the guy's voice, but he reads slowly, and my students preferred to read aloud so they could "get done."
0	Ordered over a month ago and still haven't received it!!!: The person who I ordered this from took the money and never sent the product. I'm in the process of trying to get my money back!!! Never use them!!!
0	boring and waaaayyy too much detail: like most people, i was forced to read the book for school...let me just say, if you have insomnia, i recommend this book...itll put u rite to sleep
1	Good Entry HTPC case.: The Antec NSK2400 case is a good entry level HTPC case. It is a nice size with a pretty nice finish. It is a quiet case that cools well. However the 380 power supply is a little low on the power end, especially if you are going to build a new system as of 2008. It is limited to an MicroATX mobo, which considering the size and ability to fit in a media cabinet is understandable.
1	extra hanging space where you need it: This product is great for the laundry room, and I put one up in the master bath, it's great for laying out your close for the next day, or for hanging your close as you finish ironing them.
1	Great device: We did not have any place to hang my wife's dresses so they would not touch the floor in our laundry room. Installed this and solved the problem. When it is closed you never know it is there.
1	best idea: Just wanted to say that my grandaughter is so taken with anything that Elmo does that at18m she is so brilliant, LOL. she is enamored with Elmo so anytime we get something of his especially dvd's that she can watch, they are very affective. I am so greatful for these DVDs as is her mother!!!! He keeps her very interested in everything.
1	Up Down, Near far: Great intro to the opposite theme, up/down, slow/fast, open/closed. My son loves it and says up/down whenever he hears someone say either word. Elmo is a great introducer of concepts.
0	Disappointing: From the advertisement, we thought we were buying a lot of stickers. Nope. Just a few. It was very disappointing; the stickers are way overpriced for the quantity included.
0	Big disappointment: The version that was released on DVD a couple of years ago is by far the best. This version is supposed to be "restored"? My copy still has the scratches in the frames and skips every now and then. My biggest disappointment is that it does not include the reworked Raymond Burr version. Yes, I could have read that it didn't but I ASSUMED it did like the previous release did. For you purists out there it is a grand thing, but for me I wish I had of passed on this.
0	Misleading Title: The description of the book "illustrate them with150 inspired examples" is very misleading. The author talked about150 riffs. You are supposed find the actual riff tabs somewhere else. After buying this book, you may need to buy another100 books to find the150 riffs the author discussed about. Skip this book.
1	Interesting and informative.: A well done presentation of the story of O author and here perspectives on the book. The quality of the film is also very good.
1	Excellent work by a master.: Although it's not as well known as some of his other work this is Pohl at his best! Take the worst trends of society right now and that's where this book starts. This is the sequel to Space Merchants and in some ways it's a redrafting of that story. Excellent.
1	Pretty Good: My son really likes the "Dave Series". It's very informative and funny for my 4 year old. The only thing I didn't care for about this series is that Dave seems to get angry (in a funny way) a little too much. My son has commented about Dave hitting Becky.
0	High speed adventures: I bought 4 dvd's from the real wheels collection and was very disappointed. Lots of commentary and very little shots of things in action. Did not keep the attention of my preschooler--or the adults watching with him.
1	Robert Frost: For anyone who love Robert Frost poetry this book is an amazingly wonderful read. With each poem is an article telling about the circumstances when the poem was written. In this way more understanding of the poem evolves.
0	Grossly Outdated Material: While this may have been a very good book in1979, the, avian information gained over the last 20 years makes these older book obsolete, if not down right dangerous. These older books should remain out of print. I would recommend a more recent publication including periodicals such as "Bird Talk" magazine with up to the minute articles from today's (1999) experts. I've kept African Grey's for almost10 years now.
1	A must have for the Godzilla collection...: I am not sure what the fascination is with Godzilla but my son loves these monsters. This collection is good for the "b-movies" of Godzilla. I was not aware of the monster symbols noting the monsters contained in all the Godzilla dvds(but now I know). This is very good price for amount of Godzilla dvds you get. I would say that this is good quatity-wise rather quality. However my son loves it, so we will rate this with 4 stars...and I was told by him that it is a must-have for the Godzilla collectors :)
1	Audio is underrated...: I found this review to be clear, concise, and have lots of great information particularly useful on the exam. I wouldn't go so far as to say this should be your only resource, but as I was taking the Network+ I found myself remembering a lot of answers because I had read them, heard them, and spoken them. This audio review is very well produced, and the speaking parts are done very well. Also, this is a study resource that can be used while you are doing other things such as exercising, driving, or even sleeping at low volume. Credit to Coriolis for another fine product.
0	Shallow coverage of servlets, may be of use for beginners: I flicked through this title in the bookshop, while looking for some good servlet titles. The coverage of this book is pretty shallow - for example their only mention of cookies is an API listing. Most servlet books cover cookies and session management, as well as more advanced (but related) servlet topics. I'd highly recommend "Inside Servlets : Server-Side Programming for the Java Platform" by Dustin R. Callaway instead.
1	100 Times Better Than Jason Hunter's book...: This is a great book on Servlets. I don't understand why there are so many bad reviews on this book. It teaches you the basics and goes beyond the API docs.If you want a thorough walkthrough of the Java Servlet FAQ, then go grab the book by Jason Hunter :-).
0	Who edited this thing?: The book seems like a bomb someone dropped then ran. They leave no contact information for book updates, like they don't want you to find them. After reading through it and using some of the code samples, I found they were terribly written. I also found completely false information inside. They state, and I quote "The POST method on the other hand, causes the data to be encrypted and sent in a seperate transmission". - Which is completely false. If this is dead wrong, who knows what else in there is?? This guy gives servlets a bad name... where are the other servlet books?
1	Absolutely terrific !1: LOVED IT ! What a great story. Gabe and Kelsey are great together. Both strong and gentle. Suspenseful to the very end. This story has it all, passions that sizzles, suspense that hold you and characters that make to you love them or HATE them, there is no in between. Read it and try to put it down.
1	True Betrayals: This book starts with a woman named Kelsey who is trying to get over her divorce, she gets a letter in the mail and finds out the mother who she thought was dead is really alive. She goes to Naomi's farm and finds out that her mother was in prison for killing a man. She decides to stay go and stay at the farm to get to know her mother, she meets a man and starts to date him. Various things start going wrong and old enemies start coming back. I liked this book; it was a quick entertaining read for me. It's a love story with a little bit of mystery thrown in. It's not just about a romance though it's the story of a woman who is finally learning who she really is. While the heroin meant to go and connect with her mother what she really does is find out how strong she is and what she is capable of. She learns that she can stand on her own two feet and a person's history is not always the way it looks on paper. This is a good book to read when you want to sit back and relax.
0	Old map: This map is out dated and doesn't show many of the secondary roads. I lost this map the first day that I was in Belize, and never missed it. The free map from the department of tourism was just as helpful, if not as detailed.
1	Just what I needed: Having recently bought a jeep, this book was just what the doctor ordered. It's loaded with well written reviews and recommendations for off road adventures all around southern California. I've already done a few of the trails from the book and the reviews and info were very accurate. If you're new to off-roading in southern California, this one is a must.
1	4-Wheel Drive Trails: This book is very helpful to the novice or experienced off roader. It is very descriptive of trails, landmarks, and gives you a accurate mileage counter at needed intervals along the way. This book grades the trails into three classes, easy, for most high profile 2wd or 4wd vehicles, moderate, for 4wd vehicles with lower gearing and somewhat experienced drivers, and then there is difficult, for the experienced driver with specialized modifications like diff. lockers, suspension lift, recovery devices and the willingness to have some damage done to the body or drive train of your vehicle. I would highly recommend this book.
0	disappointing and overpriced: This14.95 PAMPHLET is totally overpriced. This zine is so basic that its almost not even like learning flamenco at all. Its a bit like trying to learn flamenco from someone who studied it by watching a video tape frame by frame and is trying to describe the steps to you. The castenets section looks usable, but then i do not know how to play the castenets. Also irritating is the fact that its not worth14.95! At 3 dollars, this would be a decent extremely general introduction to the dance,...its a total ripoff. The wait time is probably so that the printer can run off a copy on threr inkjet machine and send it out. (its a PAMPHLET!) ps yes i take flamenco classes, hoping this would be a good complement. And its not.
1	This book is a must read for anyone: This book takes you from group homes to the mean streets of Harlem where Claude Brown tested fate and even some of societies taboos yet was able to pull himself up from the ghetto. He looks at child hood frineds that slipped through the cracks of society that became heroin addicts, pimps, players, pushers, and prostitutes. He shows exactly what life in the ghettos is all about the pain and the suffering. I've read this book three times and it gets better each time.
0	Avid true crime reader but;....: this book was the only book I have purchased in true crime that I could not get into. I would be lucky if I read10 pages. I only wish I could have returned it!
1	Fun: This is the best comic book game out there. The actors capture the characters perfectly. Especially Spider-Man. The graphics are great for Playstation. It's just a fun game to play. Oh, and for the people who are THPS fans, this game is run on the same engine.
0	Horrible Printing: The printing in this book is the smallest I have ever seen - almost unreadable. Also the book has hundreds of spelling mistakes. It seems every word that should start with 'h' starts with 'b'. How can this occur in the age of spell-checkers? Chesterton deserves better. This printing is absolute garbage. The producers of this book should be ashamed of themselves.
0	Low Quality Edition Full of Errors: This edition must have been created by scanning an older one, and then neglecting to proofread the results. It is full of typos, omitted words and wrong words, which makes it very hard to read. The typesetting is also of very low quality, which also makes it hard to read. Amazon should really pay a little attention to the books they accept for sale. It would be nice to be able to assume that a book you find on Amazon meets some minimum standard.
0	Good book ruined by an incompetent publisher: This may have been a fine work in its original form, but this edition (Wilder Publications, 2008) is so shoddy, it isn't worth the effort to try to read it. Based on my own experience with OCR software, I would guess that this publisher scanned an old copy, translated it to text, then reformatted it, and printed it. There is no evidence that anyone proofread it prior to printing. It it doubtful that it was even run through a spell-check program. Periods are missing at the ends of sentences; words are left out; "d", "h", and "b" are confused; apostrophies are inserted randomly (probably fly-spots on the original), "and" repeatedly appears as "an", "modern" almost always appears as "modem", etc. ad infinitum.I read through about a fourth of the book before giving up in exasperation.
0	Disappointing: I was initially excited about this book.Hearing claims of wit and graceful apologetics. Sadly I was disappointed I actually wanted this book to be good. It seemed hard to follow and the points or arguments that were used were poor.They could've easily been refuted with other arguments that I didn't even agree with. I know that wasn't the main point of the book but honestly after reading it I'm not sure I know what that was anyway.
0	Great book, terrible publishing: There's no question in my mind that Chesterton was one of the most brilliant thinkers and writers of the 20th century. He's amazingly insightful, searching out the big questions of existence with easy, witty prose.Unfortunately this particular edition of The Everlasting Man represents the worst commercial publishing I have ever seen. It is printed in tiny, poorly spaced text, with innumerable typos making nonsense of sentences and resulting in a very frustrating reading experience. Pay a little more for a decent edition!
0	Egregiously cheap, nasty, and overpriced edition of great book: This, the Wilder Publications edition of The Everlasting Man, is an egregiously cheap and nasty edition of a great book. It is printed on oversize pages with very narrow margins in an apparent effort to reduce printing costs to a minimum. Overall, the production quality is on a par with an instruction manual that might come with a no-name hair dryer or computer part from East Asia, or, actually my first thought was off-brand Dungeons & Dragons extension materials circa1976. You will be much happier with the Ignatius Press edition for only $1.00 more, which is the one I would have gone for had it been easier to locate on Amazon. I plan to return this and get the Ignatius Press version instead, or possibly Volume 2 of the Collected Works.
0	Misleading book: This seems to be a converted thesis to book, not the worst job but certainly without much effort. I'm not surprised its not in stock.
0	It is NOT a starter kit, just a DVD!: What you are buying is just a dvd, not the starter kit that is shown on the costumer images... and the one I bought never started playing, not even once.
1	Previous reviewer reasonably unhappy: I understand perhaps why the previous reveiwer was unhappy about this new book. Although I am relatively new to Kohl, this book is somewhat repetitious. It feels more like an overview of some of Kohl's work in schools, with some noticeable development of his critical ideas. Kohl details his ideas about stupidity in the current public school system (related to his idea of "not-learning" in "I Won't Learn from You") and he has some pretty strong words for special education programs and the flood of ADD/ADHD "cases" in our schools. It's a good book, definitely worth a read; however, if you know Kohl's work intimately, you might be happier borrowing it from the library instead of shelling out $20.
1	Blue Ray vs DVD: I own both the original DVD and the Blue Ray Disc of this movie. I have played them both and it is impossible to compare the two together. The Blue Ray Disc offers much more clarity and sound to that of the standard DVD. It was given to me as a present and I plan to gradually replace my standard DVD's - at least those I particularly want to see in Blue Ray - to get the most out of the movie experience.I highly recommend this product to those interested in an incredible Visual and Audio experience.Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World [Blu-ray]
1	Off the Chain!: I don't know why this film didn't get more attention? The authenticity is amazing,down to the actors wardrobe! Russell Crowe is Capt.Jack Aubrey, a hard nosed,sail with your gut Captain. Though he shows a tender side as well. This is a MUST see for action fans and Drama fans alike! Scrip is well wrote,storyline takes you on a trip through the unforgiving waters of the southern atlantic ocean, even to the Galapogos Islands! Again, a must see folks! Take it from a movie junkie,a person who can watch all the Star Wars movies and then watch Girl Interupted with the same attention!
0	The longest plane trip ever: Master and commander, well Russel was nominated for his acting, all the reviews said how good it was, I think they must have shown it at the morgue as it was DEAD boring.... I had a flight to take and great the movie was Master and Commander. So with great anticipation I sat down to enjoy this raved about movie. I have never known a 3 hour flight to last for 6 and a half hours, well that's how long it seemed to take for this movie to finish. I had to go to the WC half way through the movie, even without sound it looked boring. Down the back of the plane were the air crew, each with their own portable DVD players watching other movies.. I wonder why??? The most boring dead beat story to come to the big screen in the past10 years..... Don't waste your money!!!!!!!
1	An Excellent Naval War; Strategy and Action Movie...: If you like war,naval sea,history and strategy movies, do not miss this one. Master and Commander will be your Number1 movie for this category..Russel Crove is at his best along with Gladiator where he puts out the smart captain character smoothly along with the story. Have been watching this movie twice a month since I have bought it. Do not hesitate and add this item to your shopping cart and your collection, you will be happy for sure...
1	Good movie: This is a very good movie, with the exception scene of the character with the cannonball (if you've seen the movie, you know what I mean). This movie features two great battle scenes and shows a decent "slice of life" for an English ship in the Napoleonic Wars and shows the cunning of two great captains as they chase and fight their way around South America.I hope that Russell Crowe and company make more of these since they come from a series of books. I'll watch them all.I recommend that the home viewer use the close captioning so that he or she can read all of the great lines used by the Englishmen used during the battle scenes. My favorite is used by one of the men in a rowboat who yells at the others, 'Pull! Pull like you're pulling a Frenchman off of your mother!'
0	Defective DVD: "Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World" is a great movie. However, I received a defective DVD which made the middle third of the movie unviewable. When looking at the readable side of the DVD after the movie froze part way through chapter13, I could clearly see the defective area. It looked as though someone had spilled a bit of acid on that part of the DVD.Amazon.com's website instructed me to go to the manufacturer for replacement of manufacturer defects.The manufacturer, 20th Centry Fox, provided me with return instructions and I shipped the DVD and information to them on Oct. 30th 2006. I paid for the return shipping, and presumable there will be no other charges to get the replacement DVD.It is now Nov.11th and I am still waiting for my replacement DVD.
0	Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz: Wow! Am I ever happy I did not spend10 bucks to see this in the theater. It is possibly the most boring movie I have ever seen. Granted, I am not particularly interested in this genre, but even my boyfriend, who was all hyped up to see this, was bored senseless.
0	Damaged DVD: This DVD was damaged and I was not able to view it. It was returned and picked up on1.4.10 and I have not yet received a credit for it. Please let me know how to proceed and receive my credit so I can purchse another DVD. I was very excited about viewing it and would still like the opty to do so. Thank you.
0	A movie about blond hair, mostly: A British warship in the Pacific is taken by surprise and pounded hard by a bigger, faster, better designed and better armed French warship during the Napoleonic wars.Nevertheless, the British give chase and we kinda know they will prevail because they are ... blond.This is confirmed by the few scenes where you actually get to see some Frenchmen. They are shaggy, dirty, grim, and, unfortunately for them, not blond.So everything makes sense.Entertaining, mostly of you are blond and not French.
0	Beautiful But Boring: England is at war with France. Russell Crowe plays a sea captain chasing after an American-made French ship. Not throughout the entire movie was I made to feel like I had to chase the ship too. I never felt the obsession on the level I was intended to. First it was a Moby Dick movie, then it was something else, then back to Moby Dick again. I took a break1/3 of the way through to come back in to one of the crew jumping off the ship to commit suicide. I would have jumped too if I were in this movie.If you like cinematography, it was absolutely gorgeous. But you might want to wait to rent. There are far too many other good movies releasing this time of year to see instead.
1	Good movie, better disc!: I didn't know what to expect, in fact, I actually expected this to be a long drawn out movie. However, I was pleasantly surprised. It has a good story that keeps your interest. Although the picture quality of this blu ray is excellent, the sound steals the show. Those with a capable speaker setup (especially the sub) will benefit the most. In the first scene it sounded and felt like the canon ball was going straight through my room. There are even times where it seems like things were gonna fall on my head. If you've never seen this movie, I would rent it first. If you have seen the movie, I wouldn't hesitate to pick up this blu ray just for its demo worthy soundtrack.
1	Top notch audio, video unimpressive and no extras: I really liked this movie in the theater and on dvd. Sound design and delivery is top notch on this blu-ray version. The video is somewhat of a disappointment to me. The video seems to lack the punch that I know blu-ray can deliver. Not much is offered in the extras department. Overall, I was expecting a little more than I received.
1	For God and Country: The production values of this film are excellant and the script is first rate. The overall performance of the entire cast is also excellant. However, the viewer knows what is going to happan in this movie as soon as it starts. The good guys(the English) are going to win. The entire film is a trip to this end- the only mysteries being who of the not most major actors in this film are "killed" in the battles to come and how the British captain defeats a bigger, faster, and better armed French ship. This is not to make lite of this film, it is entertaining and interesting. Just how many times you will rewatch this film- the purchaser will have to decide.
0	Yuck: Worst Russell Crowe movie I ever saw and I really like Russell Crowe. He did not really have a lot of lines to say. The movie was very boring in my opinion.
0	no go: my husband got himself all set up for a peaceful aftenoon viewing, this was short lived as DVD announced could only be played in 'A' zone.
0	Expect nothing and you may not be disappointed: I walked out of this film with nothing, no sense of exhilaration (like one gets with good action sequences), no warmth, as with a great story that you just learned about, there were some good visuals, and the audio was strong (you felt a chill from the rain and wind from THX) - but that was by far the highlight.I laugh when I read the reviews from Big Name reviewers that say such great things about this film. I guess politics in Film reviewing is no different than any other politics - people will say what they need to when the perks / or $ is good enough. (Hell, if our President is doing it - why shouldn't a movie reviewer).
0	most disappointing of any Crowe film...........: The story basically is Aubrey chasing around in the southern part of the hemisphere after a French man'o'war.....that is it...I found it (extremely)tedious and annoying.One of the most distracting part of it was the noise.The dialogue was often drowned in it.....Frankly I think Weir should have spent a bit more time on character development........If you think that this film is exciting, then you probably would love watching grass grow.......
0	waste of time......: I wanted so bad to like this movie, but unfortunately I could not. This movie almost put me to sleep, oh it's true. I had a hard time understanding the dialog so I was forced to use the english subtitles. There's almost zero action in this movie and even the one battle scene was weak. Too much talking and playing violins.(hee haw!) Very, very boring movie. I'm sorry guys but this one sucks bad... Real Bad!....... Can you dig it?
1	Good step by step guide: The book is spoton and easy to follow. However I need to use scripting for version 4.0b. Is there one available for that? Is there one coming out soon?
1	Outstanding: This was my first O'Reilly book, and one I've used ever since as a yardstick of what they're capable of producing.Faced with the daunting task of writing a compiler, I discovered this book and was amazed at the wealth and depth of information it contains.It could possibly do with a little extra theoretical background, but if you are looking at any sort of task involving lex and yacc or their derivatives, buy this excellent book.
0	ok, but there is a better LEX/YACC book: To keep it simple, the book "Introduction to Compiler Construction in UNIX" introduces and explains LEX/YACC far better than this book. It uses a more realistic example and shows the error handling in more detail. This book is ok for a quick intro, but for a 'real" user, refer to the book I mentioned above.
1	An Almost Adequate Dvd II: The original Japanese theatrical release is remastered and looks pristine. However, this is not the case with the American English dubbed version. Classic Media should've reconsidered cleaning up the American version as one may want to watch it as an alternative to reading and concentrating on the subtitles.Included on the dvd are features that are welcomed by die hard fans of Godzilla but personally I would've wanted interviews with stars of the film-giving their insights on the movie, experience in filming scenes etc. It especially would've been a treat if they were able to get an exclusive interview with the peanuts.In short, this should be in any Godzilla collection especially for completists.
0	Good movie, but the DVD presentation falls short...: Let it be known that I'm an avid Godzilla fan, and I wanted some DVDs for my new DVD player, so I bought this DVD. Boy, was I disappointed! There's really only 3 extras on the DVD--interactive menus with scene selection, a Destroy All Monsters Game Cube promo, and audio set-up options (english mono and 5.1 Surround sound). The 5.1 Surround sound echoes and sounds unbarable. Options to change the language to Japanese, and add/remove subtitles would've been nice, as I don't care for dubs. The picture's quality is really bad--there's scratches, and what not, making it seem like a bad video transfer. Still, the promo's pretty cool, the animated intro by Mothra's kinda neat. Overall, this DVD is worth picking up only if you can't get a hold of Simitar's superior version.
0	Wannabe Beatles: It seems that they have always tried to be like The Beatles in everyway of their career. They keep telling everyone they are greater than Jesus - the world only took note when The Beatles said it. This album is REALLY disappointing and shows the weak(est?) side of Oasis...great sound when snapped.
1	Admitted Oasis fan says "Go buy this CD!": Okay, so I've always been an Oasis fan. So what? True, Definitely Mabye and What's the Story are their best CDs. So what?These guys are good and know how to make music. Some people hate the Beatles comparison, but I really do think it is appropriate. While maybe not as inventive as the Beatles, their harmonies, lyrics and music are outstanding. Their songs tend to grow on you with repeated listenings. Their CDs tend to be strong all the way through.This is an outstanding CD highlighted by some very good tracks. Fxxkin' in the Bushes (while I hate the title and "lyrics") is bold and bouncy. Go Let It Out, Put Yer Money Where Yer Mouth Is and Gas Panic are all terrific songs. The rest are "just" good.
1	Classic Oasis is back: This album to me far out weighs Be Here Now and to consider the kind of mainstream music out there now, with this album Rock N roll is hopefully back! Great songs on this album include the spiritual Who Feels Love? The timeless Gas Panic? and the sure to be Oasis classic Roll It Over! A special album indeed. Especially if your a fan of the Beatles White Album.
0	Damn, this one was way too boring.: Ya thought What's the story was a stupid cd, think again. This cd takes the cake as the most stupid cd this year has released. I hate Oasis and it's arrogance. I hate every cd they've ever released. I'm glad I've only bought 2. Stay away!
0	Oh come, have some imagination people....: Oasis were never really the most talented or imaginative band, but they wrote good pop songs that made sense 5 years ago. But this? It's overblown, uninspired MOR rock. Why buy this imitation when you can buy the real thing, or, shock horror, something new and imaganitive (check out Primal Scream...)
0	Where's Liam?: I'm a big Oasis fan. I was one of those few people who actually thought "Be Here Now" was brilliant, but this stinks. Only "Go Let it Out" even sounds like Oasis, the rest of the stuff is downright odd, and usually bad. Liam isn't even on 3 of the10 songs, and, unfortunately, those are 3 that actually show some promise. But, without Liam, they sound flat and lifeless. If you want to hear just how bad a song Oasis can make, just listen to "Little James" it must be some sort of inside joke, beacuse it is truly horrible. Buy the single, but leave the album alone.
1	Oasis is finally back!: Oasis is probably one of my fave rock groups ever. I've been waiting for a long time for this album to come out since The Masterplan. SOTSOG is great! I think I got the explicit version (it has two red X's, not that sign). The songs are great. I don't understand why people don't like this disc. It's different than their other ones. They don't have that Beatles sound really anymore. Well, it's not as distinct. If you love Oasis as much as I do, go get it! You won't be disappointed!
0	what a waist of time: Who would have thought, that with such a "great" list of actors & actresses that this movie would be so bad. The scrip must have been written by a foul mouthed teenager as it had no depth and no direction & every other word was a swear word. Do people really talk like that? Not were I live and thank goodness. YUK
0	Boring Movie: What a disappointment this movie was. It had really good actors but it was slow, uninteresting, and just a waste of time.
0	Bad language alert: When a movie gives Jesus the F word as a middle name I can't watch it and it is all over for me.
0	Then she found me.: Hard language was not expected! The F bomb is dropped including,"Jesus F'ing Christ." This is unacceptable. Not for families. Otherwise it was fair.
0	helen hunt is like a piano with one key: From the beginning of the movie, to about three-quarters of the way through, when I ejected it--I kept telling myself "it's got to get better"--it never did. There wasn't a single character that "grabbed me"--and at least two that finally caused me to push the eject button.Does Helen Hunt ever play a role where the audience isn't glaringly aware that it's Helen Hunt on the screen? She whines and chews her way through every line of dialogue until the hair on my arms stands on end. She never deviates: A Good Woman and Then She Found Me--these are very different movies--you'd think she'd do something different with the characters (to fit the time and the place in which the story takes place). I've made a pact with myself--no more movies with Ms. Hunt. This one was the last.
1	Kind of Slow but Good Story: Watched this with my mom and four aunts. Totally a chick-flick. Good story, worth watching. Any movie with Colin Firth is! right?
0	Bette Midler Saved This Movie From A One Star: This movie started slow and an hour into it I found myself waiting for something interesting to happen, by that time I felt I had so much time invested I may as well watch the rest. What torture. Horrible movie with disfunctional characters that behave like fools. Then finally Bette walked in and saved the day, she didn't have any great script to rely on though. Helen Hunt and Matthew Broderick don't have any chemistry and they're not believable as a couple so when things get rocky in their marriage you find yourself rooting for the break up. Helen's more believable with Colin Firth but her role makes her out to be an idiot. There's nothing interesting about this movie, not even the setting. I'm a huge Colin Firth and Bette Midler fan and their roles here are forgettable.
0	Where's the comedy?: The bright spot in this movie was Bette M. I don't understand how an actor of Firth's calibre could waste his talents by appearing in this drivel. To characterize this movie as a comedy is a total misleading fib. Nothing like the book!
0	utter tripe: this book is down there with linux unleashed. It tries to cover every linux topic under the sun, while subtly missing everything useful about every topic.this book should be completely avoided at all costs. the authors (I can't imagine how it took two to write) have just gleaned information from the intros in every howto.get the howtos. if you want it in hardcopy, get a printer. or get the latest linux bible.actually, I would have given this book0 stars if that was an option.
0	Imports are silly/don't buy it.: Sorry, but one of only two good songs on the 'Eat Me, Drink Me' album are found right here. Yes, "Heart Shape Glasses" is a cool tune...but the other sing isn't worth spit..anyway it's presented. Actually, despite the fact that Marilyn manson has established himself as one of the most meaningful songwriters in Rock History, there is no evidence of that on this horribly rediculous album (Eat me Drink Me). All I can say, is that if your looking for a rip off of My Chemichal Romance, HIM, Modest Mouse...you found it. Manson is still a legend...but this whole concept is his least interesting album to date.
0	Awful: This book is horrible. Written as if the person reading it chews rubber-bands and drinks glue for entertainment. Avoid any class using this book. Would give .10 star if possible.
0	Hair: Its Power and Meaning....: An awful atrocity of the literary genre. It was like the personal notebooks of various authors compiled into an uneven mess. Too many articles, too many footnotes & references to page numbers of other books, too little of pictures. Too many irrelevant points of view. I did not enjoy it. It's only a few hundred pages and is entirely black & white, and it was way to high-priced. Like $24.00. If you're looking for any meaning or pictures of the wonderful & elaborate hair dos of Asia, you will find no information in this horrible book.
0	Where's the heat?: This one's going back to the store. It has been turned on for almost half an hour and I barely feel the heat. If you ask me, my feet in some thick socks would produce the same amount of heat. As for the "massage", it's worthless to me, but I am not one for vibrating massage anyway, I prefer shiatsu. I get cold feet when I am home and not moving around a lot, so I think I will stick to wrapping my electric throw blanket around my cold feet!
0	This Book Doesn't Deliver: I bought this book after it was rated one of the top ten real estate books of the year in the Los Angeles Times real estate section. Boy, was I disappointed. This book didn't come close to living up to its promises. The author gave too much information and not enough direction for the typical layperson. He explains the reasons behind all the fees that are attached to loans, but does little to explain how to avoid or reduce them. He describes the different types of loans available, but doesn't really tell you why you should choose one over another. This book was a mostly a waste of time. You are better off reading the section about mortgages in Home Buying For Dummies and finding yourself a good mortgage broker.
0	Lacks detail in Backup & Recovery Section: I used this book (Exam Cram - Test 3 & Test 4 for OCP) and the Jason Couchman (Oracle Press) DBA Exam Guide (the one that's over1000 pages in length) to review recently for the Backup & Recovery Exam for the Oracle Certified Professional Track. This book's section on Backup and Recovery really wasn't adequate in my opinion to pass the test. It did provide a very good general overview, but one really needed the Couchman book to get the level of detail sufficient to answer some of the questions on the certification exam. I did pass, however, but do feel that this book alone would not have sufficed as the single resource to study for the exam. I cannot vouch for the Tuning section of the book (Exam 4 in the series), because I have not read that section at all.
1	EXCELLENT: Excellent at removing small scratches from auto finish without damaging the paint. I have used this for years and found nothing better.
0	bleah: Schlock Rock, Cock Rock.....whatever you want to call it. I'm just glad those days and those types of bands are gone. Brad Gillis was a douch bag!
0	Only good if you know the program: This book is a good reference but not for those who are not proficient already in MAX. As others have stated, the examples often skip steps, assume knowledge of the workings of the program and show "this is what you should end up with" pictures that don't relate at all to what the instructions give. I get the impression also that each chapter was written by a different person because they cover material that has sometimes been discussed or later chapters cover basic material that was left out at the beginning. If you are beginner, don't buy this.
0	the pill splittter did not work at all well the most important medication I needed to split (Coumadin): the Deluxe Pill Splitter By Apex Healthcare did not work WELL at all FOR the most important medication I needed to split (Coumadin). I am very disappointed in it. Can you send me a return authorization and replace the splitter with another more suitable one?
1	Boxes, Boxes and More Boxes, Oh My!: Mom's moving to another stated and needed a tape dispenser that would be hassle free allowing her to zip through taping up packages quickly. This worked. Every time we spoke over the tele, she raved about it.
1	Great Book: Easy to follow instructions. Every recipe I tried was a success. The lack of pictures is a minus. I strongly recommend it
0	Publisher's Dream: It is fairly obvious that the publisher is going to milk this series for all its worth.There are indications that a number of writers/editors may be involved with writing for the series.Nothing at all wrong with this, if you enjoy the kind of pulp output developed in the 40's and 50's and carried through to this series.My Advice: Wait until you see the Blockbuster Promotion which says that this is the last one: finally the Last Battle will be fought and...have some sort of result, which will spawn the next series.And the publishers will enjoy your moneyShannon O'Hara
0	A long series made seemingly endless with this book: I began reading the series better than 6 years ago not knowing it was going to turn into a lifelong pursuit. Lord of Chaos, along with the preceding two books, suddenly began to drag. It's as if Robert Jordan only has 5 books worth of quality writing to put into this series but is under contract to put it into10.I've been reading Chaos since it was released on paperback (who knows how long ago that has been) and I've yet to finish it. Will I? Probably, but only because I've invested too much time in reading the previous 5 and I'm curious to find out how this whole thing ends.My only hope is that the remaining books pick up the pace somewhat and eliminate a lot of unneccesary bland page filler.
1	Lord of Chaos: This book is my personal favorite so far in the series. It had many pros and a little con. the pros were: the creating of the black tower. the healing nyneave can do. and the last chapter is very good. there is also much much more. the bad sides are there are still long talks between nyneave and elayne. The boring tugging of braids, smoothing of skirts, and icy stares.The last chapter,Dumai's Wells, is my favorite because of the battle there. Over all it was the best so far to my opinion.
1	The definitive exploration of fantasy writing in our time.: Robert Jordan continues his complex tale of Rand , the Dragon Reborn, a man born to save the world and in doing so scorch it beyond recognition. In this book, Rand continues his struggle against waiting maddness and ever more determined foes, while the Dark One begins seeding the land with chaos. A must Read!!
0	This book may just make me quit reading this whole series: I can't believe the number of good reviews I've seen on this book. This volume advances the plot by so little, it could have been done in100 pages or less. And I'm sure I'm not the only one who's getting sick and tired of the endless bantering, ranting and raving of the women in the book (especially Nynaeve). It seems like Mr. Jordan is determined to just make all of the female characters in the book look like fools (he's doing a great job so far). I had originally thought that this series was going to end at 8 books, but now I'm not so sure. It seems that Jordan is just going to drag this series out for as long as it takes. The writing is getting worse, the situations are getting less interesting, and it seems that he's writing to an audience of12-year-old boys.
0	Never ending: I acutally spoke to Robert Jordan at a book signing at the time this book came out. At that point I asked him:"how many books there were going to be in the series?" 7 to 9 he says, not quite sure yet."about the plot - do you have it worked out?" Making it up as I go.My heart sank when I got these answers and it probably explains why the series has got so bad from this point onwards. I stopped reading this series when I heard these answers, because I knew it wasn't going to end up well plotted out and was just drifting on and on.This may explain a few mysteries as to why this series has declined in quality so badly. He's got 2 stars because the books were still readable at this time - but there was/is no end in sight still.
0	Great book, wrong Cover: This is a great book (5 star content), however, the kindle edition does not have the new redesigned cover (reason for1 star rating). I really hope this gets fixed soon. The new covers are the only reason I am purchasing these books on the kindle. All the other WOT books I have purchased for the Kindle have the nice redesigned cover. If you want to know what the cover should look like (from the Tor Website): [...]
0	Yawn....: ....when I had trouble sleeping at night...all I had to do was pick this book up and I'd be passed out within15 minutes. I've read the first six books of this series, and this one by far, was the most difficult to get into and finish. The only character who seemed to grow and mature was Egwene. Perhaps it is time for me to go to another author/series...any suggestions?
1	I don't understand people: I really don't understand the mindset that would say this isn't a good book. It was spellbinding. There is character development. You care whether most of the characters live or die. There is ample development of the storyline and you feel a move to the end of the series especially with the massive developments of the end. It may not be great literature (but then it may be), but it is a fun read that doesn't seem nearly as long as it is.
1	Excellent purchase!: I was not willing to spend the $700 for Toyota to put the towing kit on my vehicle so I picked up the Hopkins adapter and a towing kit off ebay for under $200. Installed all in under an hour, works well with my camper!
1	Great Product, Great Customer Service!: I purchased this adapter (47185) at Walmart. It is ruggedly consructed and easy to install and works great. The real reason for my review is to commend the customer service at Hopkins Mfg. Some how I misplaced the mounting bracket that came with the adapter when I was working on the wiring and drilling mounting holes. I called Hopkins to buy another bracket... they said they will send me one for free, and 36 hours later it was at my door! Thanks Hopkins.
1	"Dave" video series: My son LOVES all these videos! I think the guy "Dave" is a little corny but he does do an amazing job showing kids all the trucks, etc. Very recommended- my daughter watches them also.
0	This book is complicate and ugly: This book starts with "What is PL/SQL?". But through the following 900 pages, I could not find a simple example showing how to test run a simple PL/SQL code or procedure through Oracle sqlplus or other Oracle calling interface, such as OCI and Proc. Well, my rating above might be biased. I made a career change from physics to become a professional C/C++ programmer by reading K&R's C Programming Language to begin with. However, I do not feel reading this book alone can get me anywhere but waste all my time. If five stars for K&R's, one star is all for this book. It's a matter of Simple and Beautiful vs Complicate and Ugly.
0	Not a reference book: This book is useless as reference it doesnt fully describe basic functions like to_number. author waste pages on style which is useless to experienced programmers. waste of money
1	God's love, it's an awesome thing: Wow, what a wonderful book. Kendra has put into words, what love is and how love works. Not only does she allow us to learn about wordly love, but she has given us the advantage of knowing about the greatest love of all, God's love. If you have no idea has to how God's love works, this is the book for you.
0	Not quite the Originals: Beware, these songs sound a bit remixed, and are not the original sounding radio hit singles. Usually .89 cent songs are a red-flag.
0	Don't bother ordering these: The listing picture is not representative of the product. It is made out of hard plastic, and it is thick. The result is that it extends into the wheel well by about an inch!Because of the photo, I was expecting something that fits tight against the back of the wheel well and wraps around the body a little bit. I was surprised to see that this mounts against the back of the well but extends so far into the wheel well.
0	Bought for Mercedes: I thought these looked like decent rock guards. I'll probably give these away if anyone will even take them. I'll be buying something off the self from a department or auto parts store for less money that will be more durable.
1	Ray Ban Sunglasses: I absolutely love these sunglasses. These were a replacement for a pair I lost while swimming in a lake. The originals were actually a little too big. This is why I lost them. Ordering through Amazon, I was able to get a pair just like the originals that fit and at a better price. Can't beat that!
0	Confused look at ATL: While I respect the authors as programmers since this book does contain some valuable information, they have no business writing books. This book spends all of its effort discussing how COM works and then how ATL was implemented and provides little insight on how to actually use ATL. After reading this book I was very discouraged from using ATL. Few things are adequately explained. I wonder who the target audience for this book is? It is certainly not ActiveX developers. The second half of the book is superior to the first half. Inside COM, by Rogerson, puts Inside ATL to shame.
0	There are better books than this: I was looking forward to this book for several months. It was supposed to be released originally Oct. '98, but the release date kept getting later and later. I really thought once it did come out it would be a good book. Boy was I wrong. I would recommend trying a different book if you want to learn or use ATL.
1	We love it, however, . . .: We truly love the Canon PIXMA mini260 Photo Printer. The quality of the photos is sharper, clearer and has brighter color than those we saw that were printed on the HP 712 photo printer.However, it would be very nice if the Canon PIXMA had 2 to 4 Gig of internal memory. Also it does not directly receive our Olypus XD photo flash card. This means buying an adapter to insert the card into in order to feed photos directly into the printer or downloading the files from the card onto the computer hard drive and then into the printer. It is not a problem as long as you have any flash card other than the XD.The adapters are a little hard to find locally. They'er avaliable on the net.All in all - the quality of the photos makes up for the file download hassle.
1	Simple - It's good to be me!: The one who loves Gene Simmons or Kiss will love this - Gene is crazy - but perfect and this is why we love these DVDs. We bought the1st two packages so it was clear to us - to also buy No. 3. In germany you are not able to buy these packages and in TV you will always get a translated version - that's boring.
0	Another fake reality show: This show is entertaining, but it annoys me that a show that is meant to be a reality show is fake. I didn't know how fake it was until I watched the episode "Gene Down Under". The entire episode involving Gene buying a football team is fake, none of that happened in real life.I wish this show was more reality than "scripted reality".
0	One of the least useful I've encountered!: I find this set to be next to useless. The Italian on it is so very basic that it's an insult to anyone who has already made any effort at all to learn the language. For all its faults, I find the Michel Thomas set much more helpful - ditto for the Berlitz Intermediate Italian. I concur that the CD's have (even as "brand new" ones) places where the skipping / data flaws are terrible and there is too much dead air on them. Don't waste your money. There are better courses that don't insult your intelligence, and that also use Native speakers (if this is important to you).
0	ELP Goes POP - Lets Us All Down.: I am a lifelong fan of ELP. My favorites are WORKS and Trilogy and the Self-Titled CD but overall, I believe there is something awesome in every ELP album. Except this one. This was the only ELP CD that I did not yet own because I was scared to buy it. Now that I have purchased it I am at a loss for words.This is not the ELP that I remember. This is an attrocity. So I did some reading up on the subject and I found out that this album was basically belched out in order to fulfill a contractual obligation. Don't expect any of the same energy you're used to from ELP. Clearly, their hearts are not in it with this one. It has a rushed feel and there is nothing impressive here.I am sorry. I really wanted to give a better review than that because they are my all time favorite band. But I cannot.-(V)az
0	C++? I don't think so!: The caption on the front of this book says: "Provides a concise, comprehensive guide to the ways ADO 2.0 can be used in all kinds of applications. Demonstrates ADO using VB, C++, J++ and scripting languages with ASP."I have no issue with the first sentence. The second sentence, however, is a blatant lie. I think Wrox should be ashamed of themselves. There are a combined total of less than a page of things referencing C++ in here. If you're going to claim something, maybe you should make sure you actually deliver. This is pathetic.I, for one, am not planning on buying any more Wrox books in the future.Tom McKearney tmckearn@hotmail.com
1	Very good book: I truly enjoyed the book. Very interesting story line and very thought provoking. Well written and I couldn't put it down.
0	too far fetched: Find something else to read. This is not believable. I did want to get to the end of the story but I became impatient with the middle.
1	LOVED IT TO THE END...: This is my third Picoult novel and I have the fourth ready to start. I was riveted by this book and stayed up until 6:00 a.m. 2 nights in a row to get it finished. I LOVED it until the final paragraph. Then she lost me. I still give it 4 stars because she's an awesome writer, but I just didn't "get" the final scene. Maybe I'm dense, but I have mulled it over all day and still can't figure out what it all means in the end. Oh, well...I recomend Picoult anyway. After reading The Pact and Handle With Care, I ordered Keeping Faith and Nineteen Minutes and will probably read her entire collection. She is a wonderful writer and I'm happy to live in New Hampshire because I recognize a lot of the places she writes about!
1	God, in a new light: Jodi Picoult's book "Keeping Faith" made me think about my own religious beleifs in a new light. It also taught me some things about different faiths that I didn't know. The amount of research that goes into her books is amazing. I highly recommand any book writen by this author.
1	Keeping Faith: Jodi Piccoult is the most amazing author! Her in depth research and portrayal of controversial subjects is astounding. Every one of her books seems as if she's telling her own story. Great read!
1	Keeping Faith: I love this book, well written and kept me reading till the very end. Totally recommend it!!!
1	Excellent book!!: Fabulous book really made me think a bit different than other books by Ms. Picoult, but just as captivating! Highly recommend!
1	so wonderful: wonderful writing, intriguing characters, and a unique story line that is pleasantly unpredictable. this was another stellar book by picoult.
1	always enjoy her books: Jodi's books are predictable (drama + court case) but I always enjoy her writing and find I always learn something new.
1	a nice surprise!: I have been reading Jodi's books wayyyyy before she became so mainstream. I never bought this book though because the topic seemed really iffy to me. I just didn't see how she could pull off this topic and make it into a good book. After getting her newsletter though and seeing one of the characters would be in her new book, Change of Heart, I decided it was time to read it. I must say I'm so happy I did. As a Catholic I found it especially interesting. Don't let the topic fool you though like it did me. There is a lot of religion but underneath that is a great plot and story line. Really enjoyable!
1	Keeping Faith: This is an unusual book, but it sure keep your attention. This story kept my attention throughout the entire book.
1	keeping faith: An easy read with a good story line...keeps you guess til the end! If you a Jody Picoult fan you will enjoy this1
0	Not a page turner: I had to read this book for a book club and that is the only reason why I finished reading it. It dragged on and on and on- a lot of fluff with religion thrown in. I can see how someone could see the "deeper message," but the book was boring. And for 400 pages, it is almost a waste of time. Maybe if the book was half the size I would have somewhat enjoyed it and given it 3.5 stars.
0	You have to like the heroine and I didn't: My title is basically my review. I didn't like Charlene. There are strong women and then there are self absorbed whiny people, Charlene fits the latter. Why the author describes Dennis as being loyal and wonderful is beyond me. He didn't have the gumption to break off his "engagement" before he starts an affair with the wedding coordinator. Charlene needs some snappy dialog and some female friends to get her on the right track but then that would be a Jennifer Crusie novel.....the premise for this book showed promise it just wasn't well executed.
1	Great Book for Learning about TCP/IP !: I found TCP/IP JumpStart very helpful on a topic that is new to me. Computer networking field is a new topic that adds dimension to my portfolio. Andrew Blank has a wonderful way of teaching so a novice can understand yet an intermediate doesn't get bored. He brings examples and illustrations to the text enabling you to understand or actually visualize the technology concept. TCP/IP JumpStart brings technology into terms for beginners, also more advanced students can collect new ideas and concepts. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is about to take a class or would like to learn about TCP/IP. This is a book that I can highly recommend to anyone.
1	A collection of one of the best comedies ever: This collection of all12 episodes of Fawlty Towers is great! It is a nicely packaged 3-disc set and the episodes are all classic and gut-bustingly hilarious. I highly recommend purchasing this complete set.
0	Fawlty Towers - The Complete Series, DVD: The Fawlty Towers episodes are hilarious and deserve their growing cult status. However, this DVD set is poor quality and not recommended. The problem is the compression used in order to fit the series on three DVDs: the frame-rate has been significantly reduced. This would be mostly unnoticeable on a slow moving film, but there is considerable amounts of fast movement in Fawlty Towers, so the result is a very distracting, jerky effect where actors magically jump from one position to the next. There is also a graining quality to the image that suggests other types of compression. What's the point of a DVD when the VHS delivers better viewing?
1	Classic Cleese: It's such a shame only12 episodes were made...This is great English comedy... in fact great universal comedy..I loved it... John Cleese is a Genius.
1	Laughter is the best medicine: My wife and I watch Fawlty Towers on Saturday nights as a relief from the negative media barrage. The episodes have never let us down, and we hee-haw all evening. We love to watch them over and over. Great movies, those British sit-coms.
0	overRated!: I'm sorry, but Fawlty Towers was at best a mindless sitcom. Characterization, plot, and even setting were a bare minimun as Cleese mugged his way to cheap laughs. It's funny for about three minutes and after that the same joke over and over just gets tired.
1	Fawlty not Farty: I love BBC comedy & this was a great addition to my collection - FUNNY! I can just play it for great background slapstick when I'm piddling around the house even...
1	BUY THIS TODAY!!: I'm a stickler when it comes to comedy-especially tv comedy. When I saw this series back in the 70's I laughed very hard. Now that it's on DVD complete with all12 episodes, I put the discs in, kicked back and laughed even harder. It didn't help that I had a slight cold-I could barely breathe and my ribs started hurting after watching the first disc. I then proceeded to watch the other two discs. I was in bad shape by the time I was finished but I didn't care. These old episodes are hilarious. This is the way tv comedy should be!!
1	A must have.: Although dated sets detract somewhat the overall effect is splendid. A must have in any collection.
0	dissapointing!: only good song was lyla and even that was no good, im onna pre order the new offspring album instead!
1	Oasis rockin'!: This album many not blow you away on the first listen, but it could easily grow on you! It's definitely better than Heathen Chemistry, and may be the band's best album since Morning Glory! It sounds slightly different from any other Oasis albums, but it's still something that Oasis fans should appreciate. If you hate Oasis, then you won't like this album, but if you're an Oasis fan, then I definitely recommend this album for you!
1	Oasis are generally good.: Really, it is hard to go wrong with an Oasis record. They always have some good lyrics hovering over some good rock music. To me, none of their albums, with maybe the exception of "What's the Story" are really totally great and timeless, but overall, it is good rock music.
0	Waste of paper. waste of plastic, and a waste of paper.: Thankyou Oasis but no thankyou, your time is well and trully up, at the moment anyway.Your album don't "Beleive the nonsensical lies and dishonesty towards all who like good music and are fans of Oasis" is a dissapointment worthy of rating in itself, funnily enough it gets nice well rounded one star.The album has "NO" direction and "NO" purpose, sounding more or less, no more like Oasis take on1960s rock n roll, which of course has been, been and down and has its place in time, but now I think its time to move on and do something new thankyou very much and givin the "DISGUSTING" state of new and older bands at the moment (beleive it or not) it was up to you to shine the light. That ended after your great album "Heathen Chemistry" so thankyou but no thankyou.
0	Modern Oasis is Rubbish: The one star is for Liam's hair on the inside cover. At least that still has it's dignity.As for the music, I believe they have finally lost their touch.The Importance of Being Idle, Part of the Queue, and Let There Be Love are mediocre. Unfortunately, all of the other tracks are completely unlistenable.It's sad that a band who was once so great are putting out this kind of trash, but luckily for their fans, they let us down slowly with Standing On The Shoulders Of Giants and Heathen Chemistry - so at least it didn't come as a big surprise.
1	Love it even more!!!!: Again, i just marvel in the risks these men and women take every time they get in a big rig! I love to watch the drama they face every day. It is very entertaining as well! I hope they come out with more and more episodes every year! I will look forward to seeing them every weekend!
0	Could be so much better: Housing is made very well, has a nice weight to it, but that does not apply to the base of the button which is made of plastic. If installed on an uneven surface or flashing that bends, the notch and a tab on the base do not snap together as they should. A redesign of the unit that eliminated the troublesome base would make this a very nice doorbell button.
0	Died... On a self-destruct logic board: Until the logic board went and self-destructed, it was doing well. I am very upset with Canon and its short-lived circuitry.
0	Refurbished but not tested?: I received the printer with a broken ink cartridge in the box, that should have been the first clue. Printer would not get past the set up returning an error about the "scan lock". Makes me wonder if they actually tested the printer before sending it back out again. If it hadn't been for the easy return policy I would have been very upset. Ended up buying a brand new Canon MP610 and had it up and running in a few minutes, very happy with it.
0	Digital "remastering" is horrible: This CD does not do Mr. Rifkin justice at all. It sounds like a cheap "MIDI" version of Rikin's playing - like a cheap $50 electric keyboard. Gone are the acoustic sound that can be heard on the concert grand that Rifkin's original recordings are played on. You're better off buying the "UN-mastered" original CD from Nonesuch Records. This is an insult to one of the greatest Joplin interpreters.
0	Not worth the money: Don't publishers proof read these books anymore? Numerous mistakes throughout the book including in the review questions. This book also does not cover things on the exam such as Compatibility settings. It seems as though the author just took the exam topics and wrote something that he thought was important, but not what Microsoft tested. Interestingly, one of the appendices contained test strategies that MS uses on the exams. Unfortunately the questions asked in the review exercises for the most part did not follow these guidelines.
0	Not a well written book: Book is one of the most boring I have ever tried to read. I read many travel books but this one is awful.
1	Cassette? This is 2010. Where's the CD Version: I just want to say that this is my favorite book of all time. The writing of William Least-Heat Moon is filled with wonder. I give it a10 out of10!!!However this is 2010 and I still find it strange that Audiobooks; for the most part are only available on Cassette. Heck, I don't even own a cassette machine anymore. I wish the companies would start putting these out on CD.Steinbeck's Travels with Charley is available on CD. My second favorite book.Again the book is one that HAS to be in your collection. I have probably read it over a dozen times and I always find something new.CD version please.
1	Wonderful for the whole family: Little Britches is a fantastic book. It takes the reader back to early1900 Colorado and a family who loved each other and worked very hard as they struggle to build their ranch. This is the first book in a series and once you start reading you won't want to stop. Ralph (Little Britches) learns a lot of life's lessons the hard way. His father's parenting skills gently lead Ralph to make the right choices. There are horses, cowboys, and a water rights fued that provide excitement as well as many warm family moments.
1	Pretty good reading: The writing style was simple; The storyline was engaging, the characters captivating. The story was narrated unsentimentally, but effects sympathy.However, this book contains profanity, besides mild violence and unwarranted reference to bodily function.
0	Absolute trash ...: I bought the first edition of this book - which was about 700 pages;It cost me $44.95 - and the book was not worth a penny! I believe the 2nd edition is better - because it has some extra pages and these last few pages are supposed to be better! I find that hard to believe ... The authors do not know how to write a technical book - they are belligerent! The book wanders all over the place - no details at all - or none of any consequence! If the publishers had any conscience they would send me the last section of the new edition FOR FREE! This was one of the worst computer books that I have ever run across ... AVOID other books by these authors!
0	Heavy Paperweight: This book starts strong, then becomes a sad use of dead trees. There are a number of good examples on the uses of XML, but many overlap and become repetitive. The previous comment on poor editing is well founded...the number of blantant printing and typographical errors is astounding.
0	Where is the real content?: I purchased this book on the strength that it was written by the creater of SGML so I figured 'how bad can it be?' Well I found out exactly how bad. This book fails to explain anything thouroughly, and whilst the first few chapters are fairly light and humourous, the middle section descends into needless and unjustified haranging of other fine technologies such as CORBA and seems to be one big advert for Microsoft and associates. Some of the information is just plain wrong, whilst other parts simply are badly explained. If your company is starting to try to avoid microsoft products as ours is, STAY AWAY! Boy I wish I had read the reviews before I bought this book from a bookshelf in a store. I could have saved myself alot of time and money.
0	WORST book I have come across in a LONG time....: This is a seriously awful book. It is without doubt the ugliest most badly designed book I have ever seen. Much worse it is badly written, sheds little light on the subject matter, and even more heinous, it is purports to be unbiased technical book, but mostly consists of blatantly biased chapters "sponsored" by Microsoft and others. I have just finished Chapter 6, "sponsored" by Microsoft and you would swear that IE was the only browser in the world, their implementation of DHTML the only one in the world, and there were no scripting languages/methodologies but VBScript and ASP. The writer did not have the PROFESSIONAL DECENCY to give a balanced overview of the subject matter, just tried to push MS products. SHAME SHAME SHAME on everyone involved in this terrible book. I am only giving it one star because the form won't accept anything less.
0	Where are the examples?????: For the money I shelled out for this book, I expected to be able to see some fairly decent examples of how to1. Write the XML code and 2. Use what I've written. Admittedly, I did skim through the book, but I figured, "Hey, it's the guy who wrote the SGML spec - can't be too bad, must've just missed something. I'll catch it when I read the book."Well, I haven't found it yet... still looking...nope, not there.I am very disappointed...And what the heck is a "chapter sponsor" or a book sponsor, anyway? If you've got sponsors, I should be able to get the book a wholoe lot cheaper.What a waste of money.
0	Useless: An absolutely useless source for information on xml. The examples were not clear or useful, and the writing was too pretentious to read. I would not recommend this book, or any of the others in this series (i have read the others also- searching for something applicable).
0	Advertising in a tech book?: One of the strangest books I have seen and a very disturbing trend. The authors sold corporate sponsorship of chapters and let each company write an chapter-length ad. Its bad enough to get ads at movie theaters and on rental videos, but in a technical book? It's one thing to have ads in things where the cost is largely underwritten by the ads (like magazines), but its quite another to find 25% of a full-priced book filled with ads. Buying this book will only help to standardize this practice. Send the publishing industry a message by refusing to buy this book.As many other readers point out, this book is aimed at managers who could buy the products sold by the companies who bought chapter ads.
1	Excellent book! Well written and full of great information.: This book is an excellent choice for learning about XML and the technologies (both new and old) that are utilizing or planning on utilizing XML. This book has something for everyone in the XML world, both novices and experts.
1	Great XML Overview: Just wanted to say that this is a great book especially if you like "real" XML implementation examples. If you want an overview of what XML can do for you go get this book.
1	Good transaction: Product arrived quickly, in perfect condition and was exactly as described. No problems with vendor. Very happy with product and transaction.
1	Abduction to the Ninth Planet: I am blown away by this book, and what the author describes he was shown during his trip. His account confirms living in lower gravity, in harmony and love, the way of living, all serving one intention without monetary system, the dwelling places, Earth politics compared to true governing, the history of our planet, so much of what many of us have seen ourselves. The loving light energy he describes is very real. I bless and thank Michel for publishing his report. Read it, you will love it, it will open your eyes!
0	Doesn't work with itouch: no wonder it was only [...] bucks, now that I look closer I see the ipod touch isn't supported, but wtf, it says it "works will all 'docking ipods'"I have an ipod touch, it docks, but apparently that's not a "docking ipod."Total waste of money! =/
1	SPITTING NEARLY: I,D LISTNING AND READING ABOUT SNCE1976,BUT UNDERSTANDING ALOT I THINK THE FUNNY PARTS ARE THE BEST,BUT AS WE SAY HERE IN N-NORWAY :IF WE DIDNT`HAVE THE HUMOR WHAT DO WE HAVA???
1	Enjoyable BUT....: I thoroughly enjoyed this book but, if you are looking for details and insight from "the man himself" re: Frank Zappa's extensive body of recorded works, then you will be sorely dissapointed.The first chunk of the book is mostly about his childhood and the last half or so is devoted to barbed essays on a miscellany of dis-jointed topics such as politics, raising a family, inventions that Zappa couldn't get funded, etc. In the middle you get a smattering of chronology describing the formation and first few years run of the original Mothers of Invention... Zappa's musical exploits through the 70's and 80's is nearly completely ignored!!, ...Instead of devoting numerous pages to tedious diatribes concerning the PMRC Music Labelling initiative, (which now seems like a historical "non-issue"), I would have far preferred to have read an album-by-album review by Zappa offering insight into each of the tracks and any related anecdotes behind their creation.
0	Coming out story made by straight people: At first I was gonna give it 3 stars. But after I had read some other reviews (I didn't have a chance to watch additional comments on dvd), I stopped at 2.WHy?Here's why:- Coming out story is the base of the plot, innit? Instead of making the relation between Riley and Andy more real, we are treated with scenes full of naked boobs, naked women)...- There is no chemistry between those two gays. P. Jones remains straight during the whole film.- The coming out moment is so fake. Slides? Who came with such lame idea in plot?- Instead of fighting with stereotypes, this film confirms 'em.- Some of the scenes are way too long or out of place- The type of jokes used in the plot is quite simple (farts? playing with dirty language? maybe good for teen comedy, but not for "mature" film)Good coming out story? "BREAKFAST WITH SCOTT", "BALLS"."Outing Riley" it just a poor story made by straight guys who thought they were funny...Shame.
1	Great story, well told: After watching this movie for the second time, I was able to look at it a little more objectively. It was definitely better the second time. It tells the universal story of family and love and acceptance from a gay perspective. That what we're all looking for, isn't it - acceptance? Lots of humor, likeable characters, and realistic relationships made this movie work for me.
0	Worth the price and not a penny more: I paid a ridiculously small amount for this pair of shoes - under $20. With how little I paid for them, they are fine. I would not recommend then at full price. They are not worth $69. There is no discernible arch support, the soles are not padded, and the sides are not supportive.
1	Triumph's Most Consistent: I thought this one was gonna suck and I only bought it because I'm OCD and a completist. However, I was pleasantly surprised by how good this album is. All of Triumph's other albums (except for their first) suffer from some serious filler, but every song was pretty decent on this one. Rik Emmett is gone, but Phil X does an excellent job on guitar and Gil Moore seemed to have stepped up his vocal performance. And as always with Triumph, awesome production.
0	Complete waste of money!!!: I bought this book based on the review I read in InfoWorld. I will have to say that this book provides little more than your IDE's online help. About the only thing this book is good for is kindling for my wood burning stove.
1	R & B Season 5: There are a lot of excellent reviews of this set, to which I cannot add anything better. Rocky and Bullwinkle, along with Bob Clampett's Beanie & Cecil, taught me humor when I was young. Puns, non sequiturs - you name it - it's all here, and done without the potty humor that seems so prevalent today. Thank goodness we are able to enjoy these episodes again today!
1	good reference book: this book of maps would probably be awelcome addition for an experiencedastronomer.....not for a beginningfan of astronomy. Nightwatch wouldbe my recommendation to the later.
0	don't buy the kindle edition: i got the kindle edition and returned it the next day, the offset tables are small and cannot be enlarged so you can actually read them. so save yourself the trouble and get the printed edition. other than that, from what i looked over, it looks like the book has great information in it.
1	Winter boot: Love the boots. Very warm and thick. The boots are "heavy" but it's just want you need in real bad snowy conditions that require good treads. They also fit very snug - but soft & comfortable with the interior padding.
1	Beats of the heart: Amazing music. exellent explanations, not too long just in time.The singing , the druming , the words remind us where the real beating of the heart is coming from.
0	You get what you pay for: It is unfortunate that Guy De M is known in the USA for his short stories. They are well-written and were ground-breaking150 years ago, but they do not age well. This translation is particularly poor and the Dover edition is so cheap and flimsy that the only thing good you can say about it is that it's cheap. And cheap isn't always the best value. For great French short fiction, try Emile Zola. De M's novels are great and age much better than this stuff. Historically they're interesting but have an O. Henry quality that doesn't work much anymore.
1	Cool Watch: Honestly, I have no idea what the buttons or dials do, but this watch looks cool AND tells time. I bought it because it looked alien, but I get compliments on it almost daily. It's big, and showing and gets the right kind of attention.
0	SHM CD version of Trilogy: This review speaks only to the quality of the ultra expensive, Japanese SHM CD version of Trilogy. Look for another version of this c.d.. The hiss that is present during and between songs is unbelievable. It is as bad as listening to an old cassette tape. I am blessed to own the MFSL version which I assume is still the gold standard of this c.d..I purchased this edition on a lark because it was touted that "you won't believe it's the same c.d.". Well, they were right but for the wrong reason. This is a10 star title that deserves better.
0	Not thorough, nor helpful: This books is not as helpful as I expected at all. The structure looks very good, but when I read it, I found none of the topic was explained clearly and thoroughly. For example, adding a user, it only mentioned command adduser without indicating which file that really recorded the user information. Actually, when I installed Linux and set up configuration, I have to look for other help, like Linux online help. This book just added my confusion.
1	WOW!!!!: Que has done it again!! The leader in advanced computer books bring one of the best books for beginning Linux system operators
0	Recipes lack imagination: Nothing different about recipes. I was looking for something that had some other options or ways to use my pressure cooker
1	Cookers for Dummies: I purchased this book with my new pressure cooker. It has some wonderful tips. It gives you an idea of how long to cook beans, soups etc... also shows you how to use your own recipes with a pressure cooker. The practical workings of a pressure cooker are explained to you and that was very helpful as I had never used one before. My experience has been that not all the timings are correct, at least for my altitude. For example if I cook the beans as long as the book says my beans are mushy. But it was a good start and I've learned how to adjust the timing. Over all the book was very helpful.
0	For smart dummies: The book didn't answer a lot of basic questions for me, having never used a pressure cooker. It's O.K. as a supplement to other pressure cooker cookbooks, but I was hoping it would provide more step by step instructions.Very disappointing.
0	Not as good smelling as I thought.: Doesn't smell bad but not as good as I thought. Think I ordered the wrong Mont Blanc fragrance. Husband uses it though.
0	Good for insomnia: Though some of the material is useful, I found these tapes to be long and boring. The authors read the text like a funeral procession. I would much rather recommend any of Anthony Robbins work - which always has some NLP, presented in a passionate, immediately useful way.
0	waste of money: i needed some comments on the linux ip code, the title was right and there was a five stars review by a reader, had no time to wait and so i ordered it by e-commerce. Already accustomed to comments a la R.Stevens was very hopeful What a mistake ! more than 450 pages of linux kernel listings, not only, the listed kernel was 2.0 (at this time the firsts 2.4 are out) !!!! The commentary, all at the end of the listing not very insightful, will never buy another book in this series !
0	It didn't do Lord Soth justice!: The book, Lord Soth, I found to be poorly written and failed to explain and give good reason for Lord Soth's spiral downward into the depths of evil. The way the book was written failed to show the emotions of Soth as he committed his crimes. The author seemed to just skim over the important parts, such as the deaths of Lady Korinne, Isolde, and his two children. Even though any DragonLance novice knows the tale of Soth, this book failed in showing Soth's honour and true evil. Also the summary on the back of the book concerning Soth's quest given to him by Paladine is quite misleading since it lasts a whole chapter at the end of the book. The novel also didn't fully explain what evil magic transformed Soth and his loyal knights into Death Knights. Overall I found the book very uninspired and was disappointed by it. Weis and/or Hickman should have written the book as opposed to some novice.
1	Review of Village Centenary: Miss Read books are lovely stories of the everyday life of a village schoolteacher. They are wholesome, funny and light reading. This particuluar story chronicles a school year where the school is celebrating its100th anniversary. The banter between Miss Read and her school cleaner Mrs. Pringle is wonderfully funny. I love Jan Karon and the Mitford series, these books are as delightful as a visit to Mitford.
1	Good Start for beginers: This is a good start for somebody who never build a PC before, and give you and idea on where to start and what to do. This is a typical "Hows to..." book and I'll recomended it.Michael Da CruzCalifornia
0	out of date: It's a good book but is a few years old so the material is dated. I wouldn't recommend it.
1	Cyclone Featuring the sexy Heather Thomas: here's a Movie from the past.i remember watching this way back in the days.i got it on dvd, and yea the movie is okay, but heather thomas looks great in the movie.
1	In ol' Virginia: Basically a plotless book that contains a series of sketches depicting life on a Virginia plantation circa1830. The main sketch involves a lawsuit over disputed land, which leads to comedy and romance. Kennedy is a skillful writer and offers up a charming picture of what life was like then. His style is light and fanciful, and one reads the book with a relaxed pleasure.
1	Great first watch: Great first watch if your kid likes pink and hearts. Easy to read, accurate, they'll love the pink backlight. Being waterproof is helpful as kids easily forget to not splash around when washing their hands. Price is good, too, as you won't be too upset if/when they lose it. Of course, the kids probably will, if they notice. Timex even provides a discount replacement because they know the probability of loss is high.
1	Please forgive me: All I have to say is that I bought a Britney record. The end times are surely drawing nigh. I still like the song however. It is her best work yet.
0	Detoxifying.: This is a terrible single for a decent, catchy song. Sonically, the remixes fall flat because they do not really suit the song. If you want a really good remix, download K.O.'s Level 5 Toxicity mix instead of buying this.
0	Jumping here, jumping there: With the exception of 2 or 3 chapters this book is a complete waste of money - too much useless information in a complete messy manner.
1	The feel GREAT docu of 2008: If you're feeling a little dejected about humanity in general , there's some great and positive news for you . Since streaming this absolutely wonderful and totally uplifting film , my wife and i have bought , like , eight copies for friends and family . Other folks will tell you the particulars . This film is soul Prozac . Truly do yourself a favor and check it out . It's for what ails you .
1	This book should not leave your desk...A very good reference: If you are new or have been using Linux or Unix this is a bookfor you desk next to your computer system. This book has been a pleassureto read and use. I am using the book as a teaching guide forfriends, family, and co-workers.This book caontains two cd's with examples to get your system up and runningas fast as possible.

1	Banana Hammok: Want your banana just hanging in the breeze or do you want your banana hanging in style. Well for the stylish hangers this is the display you want. Looks great and is very heavy duty.
1	Not just for bananas, anymore!: I can't believe that I'm writing a 'review' about a banana holder, yet here we are.Anyway, get two. One for your bananas, and another for, say, holding your headphones in a stylish and safe manner at your desk/listening area. This little stand works great and, at [...] is SIGNIFICANTLY less than what audio suppliers like to charge their customers for really basic crap (think of how expensive audio-branded speaker / component stands and the like are). Anyway, there's an idea for ya.I don't even eat bananas, lol.
1	Outstanding director: Daugthers of Darkness is more than a surreal masterpiece.It's an unforgettable experience.But for when on DVD more of Harry Kumel'sfilms, as the eerie Malpertuis? SOS to Amazon to urge who cares for restoring this and other treasures of the seventh art.
0	Save yourself! Don't see this hideous film!: Worse than a merely bad film is a self-important bad film. This monstrosity drips with artsy pretensions, yet is so poorly written, acted and directed that it doesn't even amuse in its badness. By the end of it I felt like a traumatized prisoner.Notes to the director: eerie lighting and bad lighting are two different things. I felt like I needed a flashlight to see what was going on - but then again, maybe the lack of lighting was a small mercy paid us by the director.The screenplay is entirely incoherent, and the actors are absolutely clueless. There's supposed to be some sort of oh-so-erotic lesbian imagery in here, but I've seen better eroticism in the worst European sexploitation films.
1	Amazingly deep for its length: A slim book, only 86 pages. It's the story of a woman who has just lost her father and is dealing with that, and at the same time trying to get pregnant, something she's been struggling with for a long time. A very likable narrator. Fusselman does a great job of conveying emotional depth with very few words.
1	Live and hilarious but missing something.: Hi, all. This is a fantastic piece of comedy of which I laugh all the way through it. I once saw protions of it along time ago and finally got a copy. But, somethings missing! The SCHOOL ROLE CALL. Anybody know of it, and know were I can get hold of it?
0	Cheesy Heroes: My three-year old grandson loves anything to do with firetrucks and firemen, but he didn't like this DVD. It was ridiculous. The two actors were really cheesy and stupid.
1	safer replacement for traditional wax candle: Safer than a traditional wax candle. Gives the same amount of light. I use this on my Nursing Graduation while reciting the Florence Nightingale pledge. Looks nicer on a low light room.
0	Don't last: Batteries don't last very long, a few days at most. I've bought similar lights in the past that would stay lit for weeks.
1	EXCELLENT FLICKERING LED CANDLES!: I bought this12-candle pack for Christmas decor and I'm really satisfied with product quality. Flame effect is life-like, I put on a frosted-glass votive and flickering effect is amazing!!! Uses CR2032 lithium batteries, best battery for LEDs, as we know, LED uses few amperage, not drain your batteries like a conventional bulb, so battery can last for years....I'll buy 4 packs more!
0	This was a disappointment: I found this book to be a disappointment. I was taken aback by the author's decision to summarily exclude some groups because he felt they were insufficiently Christian for inclusion and by his decision to interlace his descriptions of the various denominations he covers with his opinion of the "right answers" in terms of their doctrinal positions.I would recommend the purchase of the most recent edition of Mead's Handbook of Denominations in the United States over this book. It is broader in scope and relates the views of the various groups without the partisan commentary.
1	great book if you want to know the science behind Cryonics: Goes through and explains the science behind cryonics. It disproves what many of the cryonics detractors assert. Over all a good read!
0	Why is Amazon charging for Kindle version of this?: This story is well over 50 years old and in the public domain so why is Amazon charging for the Kindle version of this? It should be free. And it is free - a quick Google search will reveal full text versions that you can read online for free.
0	Where's the 3D?: I watched the whole thing without the glasses - with them it was just dark and not 3D at all. Very disappointed.
0	One boys dream of flying and finding the girl of his dreams: I suppose one of the things I have come to expect about 3D movies is they feature effects that take advantage of the 3D effect. This movie does little of that. This is the story of two young kids, a boy and girl. He dreams of flight, she is a natural engineer. Later in life they are best friends but deal with a military pilot trying to steal her heart. The acting is poor. The photography is mostly amazing.Some of the scenes shot over Lake Powell become tedious with endless stalls and boring close-ups of people in the cockpit. There is very little of what is featured in the case/cover photograph. If you're looking for a Blue Angels in 3D type video, this is not for you. If you're looking for non-actors with lots of actor close-ups generally filmed in 3D than this might be the ticket.I would have rather seen a best-of at Oshkosh in 3D instead. I wish I had never purchased this 'movie.'
0	Ultimate Writer's Cramp: Once again Imax has tried to combine a story with spectacular photography. I would think by know I would have learn my lesson. But you mention the word Imax combine with the Grand Canyon,Lake Powell and aerial photography I took the bait. This story is so simple that it takes away from the film. I feel if you do not have an interesting story to tell why try. Instead of going the educational or thrill route they went with a story that was hard to get through once let alone twice. Why Imax could settle for a plot like this when they are consistently A+ in the photo and sound department is a wonder to me. There standards can be so high on one end and at the bottom of the scale on the other. Imax has produce quite a few good films. But for my money those are films that are educatonal or have thrilling photography. This film has some of the photography but it allso has a story that will put you to sleep.
0	Disappointing Quality and Content: This 3D Blu-ray has the potential to be wonderful, but it falls short. Most of the 3D effect has ghosting throughout most of the video. Its like everything is out of focus. Also, the plot is silly and pointless. Save your money.
0	This is definitely NOT ELP!: ELP should have quit while they ahead with "Black Moon" (1992) and "Live at the Royal Albert Hall" (1993) in terms of their ephemoral 90's comeback. "In the Hot Seat" was just tarnished by quick-fix greed in terms of the quality its tracks are presented in. There isn't a single shred of any timeless ELP instrumental quirks to be found in any of these songs, and the 90's update of "Pictures at an Exhibition" is just plain dolorous! "Hand of Truth", "One By One", and "Daddy" are the only tracks that get the dubious honor of gold, silver, and bronze from me. One last "below the belt" blow on "In the Hot Seat" would be that even under the influence of a12-pack, "Love Beach" (1978) would sound like heavy dynamic make-out music (HAH)!
1	It's Good; Not Sure if "Superfast" is the Word, Though...: I just received this cookbook and was super excited to see some pretty awesome recipes in it. My only question is about the choice of the term "Superfast." To me, a wife that works full time, weekday dinners need to be fast. And, there is a plethora of information out there on fast meals, but most aren't too healthy. I need a combination of both. And, I thought this would be it.But, I think the term fast means something different to me. These are quick, easy recipes for 7PM on a Monday when I get home. These require a lot of additional prep that I wasn't looking for.It will be great for weekends when I have more time, but for weekdays, I continue my search. Looking for the holy grail that is the truly healthy, yet quick, weekday cookbook. The search continues! =)
1	A very good reader: I thought the reader for this book was very good. He did Palpatine's voice especially well. I also felt that the book filled in gaps about character motivations that there wasn't time to cover in the movie. I felt the book enriched my experience of the movie.
0	Where's the witty dialogue?: The thing that hooked me on the Star Wars saga was the incredibly constant bickering and arguing that happens in episodes IV and V: C3PO and R2D2, Han Solo and Leia, Darth Vader and the other Imperial commanders.However, in episodes I, II, and now in III, the dialogue is flat. I was falling asleep while reading the conversations in this book. Episodes I, II and III apparently are nothing more than an attempt to see how many computer-generated droids can be blown up in each movie. What a pity. What a waste of my time.
1	I Envy Lee Pulos: When I pulled several hypnosis books off the library shelf to review, "Beyond Hypnosis" did not quite appeal to me. The cover was unattractive and quite plain. However, an inner-awareness told me to check out the book and to read it. I did so.I enjoyed the book immensely, enough to order a copy for myself! Mr Pulos' book put the hypnosis phenomena into a perspective that allowed me to comprehend and apply the principals to my daily activities. I actually was able to hypnotize myself for a brief period. I envy the author for his intelligence and insight.Between readings, I left the book on my bed. Without prodding, my wife skimmed the book; I knew that she is skeptical about these things. To my surprise, she read the book in its entirety. She said that she could relate to many of the elements in the book. She commented that this was one of the few books from which we both received mutual enlightenment! The book also served as a foundation for further reading on hypnosis.
1	A part of our history, A wonderful movie of all times...: The actors cannot ever be replaced from the original movie. I LOVE this movie more than any other movie I have ever seen, I guess because you can really see a lot of the truth in it. When Scarlett says, I'll worry about it tomorrow, thats her way of dealing with the pain of Rhett leaving. To survive this is the way you must think or else you would go insane. So much emotion involved in this movie. There will never be another "GONE WITH THE WIND"......
1	the reason we have 5 stars: The first epic saga. Vivien Leigh is magnificent and Hattie McDaniel deserved an award. You sure don't need me to tell you about Gone with the Wind. A must for and and all movie buffs.Just wanted to say I'm pleased with the DVD version.
0	i would have rated it higher if only I can watch it: It keeps stopping, I pause it and start it up again the volume doesnt start right away, so you dont know what there saying, I pause it and start it and it keeps saying try again later can't connect, waste of money, won't watch a amazon movie again!!!
1	1.33:1 Ratio: The only thing bothers me is this movie is not a widescreen format.But after careful research, now I know that it was shot originally that way back in1930s.What can I do? Cut the bottom and the top to look like widescreen format?The dvd I have is actually1.85:1. I think they really cut the top and the bottom to look like widescreen alright for the DVD.Perfect movie for sure. No doubt about it.Very food picture quality. Perfect Bluray.
0	Not Wide-Screen Version: Re: "Gone With the Wind" (The Scarlett Edition): Beware. Even though this 3-disc set is Blu-Ray, the movie itself is not widescreen format. I certainly have no desire to pay almost $30.00 to watch an epic film like "Gone With The Wind" as an old square picture (with black on either side of the square imate) on my HD tv. How disappointing. If you want the widescreen version, don't purchase this particular item.
1	This is the greatest movie of the century....: This movie is an epic....and while, true, it does not meticulously keep with the novel, it is still the greatest love story of the cinematic "Hollywood glory days". Vivien Leigh is "Scarlett O'Hara", not only does she fit the description, she just becomes the character heart and soul. And there could absoulutely be no one else who could be Rhett but Clark Gable. The casting is perfect, the sets are so realistic, and the story moves along; even though it is four hours long, the movie just flies by. It is a classic, and should be seen by everyone who loves movies. This is the way movies were meant to be.
1	One of the best movies of all time: I love this movies so much. I forget how many times I have watched it. And every time I watch it gives me new excitement.
1	What? No widescreen? Sacrilege!: I was very disappointed to find my all-time favorite film, GWTW, treated so rudely with the release of this DVD. A film of this caliber deserves better. Though the transfer could have been better, I found it acceptable. The soundtrack was less enjoyable, however. While I realize there is only so much one can do to enhance a fifty-year-old recording, I was surprised at how shrill and tinny-sounding it was. The major disappointments for me were the lack of bonus materials (very cheesy, Warner Bros.), and the non-widescreen format (unforgivable). I certainly hope that Warner will offer upgrade pricing to owners of this version when the inevitable "Special Edition" is released (uh-huh, right)! Happily though, as with all classics, this film is still pure magic!
0	Romantic Racism: You have to give credit to this film for its glossy, epic sweep and the fact that it breaks new ground in filmmaking techniques. Unfortunately, the film, like the novel, promotes a destructive, romantic myth of a south that never really existed.In this Technicolor version of the Old South all the darkies are happy and smiling and dancing on the banks of the Mississippi, and obviously it's too bad the Civil War came along and ruined things. What a trashy message, and the terrible thing is that its wrapped in such a seductive and attractive package.
0	Awful, twice over!: I bought this for a Mother's Day gift--TWICE.My mom reported that most of the discs didn't work, so I returned it for a new set. Amazingly, the new replacement set didn't work either! I felt bad enough for Mom that I had to write this review and warn others.I finally learned my lesson: Take Mom out for dinner and a play instead of wasting time and money on this piece of....er, junk.
1	Gone With the Wind: Very happy with the DVD and the timely manner in which it was shipped. Amazon always does an amazing job of gettingthe product out to the customer. Thank you. I give this item a 5 star rating.
1	Gone With the Wind is the BEST!!!!!!!!!!!!: There isn't a whole lot to say that hasn't already been said about Gone With The Wind. What a magnificent motion picture for it's day and now for today as well. The DVDS' are a tribute to this must have film for your home library.
0	boring: I hope I'm watching the same movie that got so many 5 stars!! I found this movie to be big time boring. Couldn't even handle fast forward :)
0	gone with the wind: This sucked because it arrived with only one dvd in it, it should of had two. I wanted to return it but my printer is dead so I couldn't print the return so I wasted my money. this the second purchase in a row from amazon that was bad i am sure it will be a while before I order from amazon again if i ever do.
1	most excellent: At least for the beginner (myself), this was great for learning how to give a back massage.
0	These books are terrible!: Before you buy the Remote Access book from Tom Thomas read my comments on Tom Thomas's BCSN book.
1	Wonderful!: Despite having seen and enjoyed the film featuring Humphrey Bogart, I got this book, knowing it deviated from the screenplay (or, rather, the screenplay had deviated from this original novel!). I was very glad to have read this. Only the setting and names are the same - otherwise, a completely different, very suspenseful and psychologically wrought piece. Highly recommend.
1	For Maggie the Mod dog: If you are one of those consumers (as I am) that will purchase products because of aesthetics, then this product is for you/your dog. We have the large version and it is almost too big for our black lab--it holds a lot of food. The bowl has a nice weight to it and non-skid feet. Please note that our turquoise bowl faded, and although this bowl is dishwasher-safe we washed it by hand. The underside of the bowl stayed bright turquoise, but the exposed side faded quite a bit in a few months. The polymer material the bowl is constructed of is heavy and sturdy, however, it is also very rigid and I discovered that if you drop the bowl it breaks into many sharp pieces. It's a great design and I would recommend purchasing it if you like the design, but expect the color to fade and handle carefully.
0	Rabin Solo Album + Yes: If you are a Rabin fan or a fan of Rabin-era Yes, you will probably like this one. I think it sounds pretensious and uninspired. Chris Squire is missing in action. Alan White pulls some strong beats out of the can, but the rest is pure Rabin.There are some songs I can stand but most I can't listen to all the way through. I got this for [low price] in the bargin bin and I am not sure I got a good deal.-A long time Yes fan
1	Best Yet!: I don't know what makes this product different from the others but so far it's the best I've used yet. I'm able to do just about anything within minutes of painting my nails.
1	Amazing!: I love this product! I really love all of OPI's products... but this works really well for me. After a minute they are dry to the touch and after 5 minutes they are set. I will say that if you apply base, plus 2 coats of color and then a top coat it will take longer for them to completely dry but your nails will be somewhat dry. If you skip a layer of polish or the base they will dry much quicker.
0	Doesnt work.: Honestly I dont think this product works. I followed instructions carefully and it did not work. My manicure was not fully dry at all.
0	DW may be better than MS-FrontPage, but ....: I read somewhere that DreamWeaver was released to compete against Microsoft's FrontPage 97-98.Apparently the author was not aware of this fact, or else he would have done his homework and explore the POWER of DreamWeaver.I am working on a GeoCities web page dedicated to some "tricks" not covered in this book (or anywhere else). If anyone has any questions, requests, or comments, PLEASE email me. I'm here to help.
1	Place in the woods: Ecellent book to read. If you like wilderness books it is hafta read book. Interesting through out. Book keeps your attention through out
1	I keep going back to this book!: Green Darkness is one of those rare books that I keep rereading year after year. I just read it again after seeing "Elizabeth" and am reminded of what an excellent book this is. It is truly one of my favorites!
1	100 Stars!!!: This book was amazing! I absolutely LOVED it. It was hard to believe that this book was written in1972! Just like in Katherine(written in1954!), Anya Seton has done it again! I loved this book!
0	Trying to be Cujo: Okay, Cujo was a dog gone wrong, while this bear merely wanted revenge for the killing of his mate. But the rest of it seems more like what I wrote as my review title, with some drama thrown in: brother vs. brother and so on.
0	Possibly the worst book ever about motorcycling: The author may be a great guy but this book is just plain awful. I've read almost every book published on touring and this thing is the worst hands down. If you need to read a "motorcycle" book to know it's hot in Texas, Motel 6 has noisy air conditioners, chicken fried steak can be nauseating - and be told this in EVERY FREAKING CHAPTER!, than you may be able to get through his book. I gave up halfway through when the "poetry" showed up, it's hard to believe a grown man could write such drivel. I don't think I've ever had a more visceral dislike of a book than I experienced toward this one.
0	doesn't shoot: when it does shoot, it's awesome. but i got it today and shot it about 200 times and it worked about 5
0	brothersjudddotcom barely recommends: When the Bridge of San Luis Rey collapses, in Peru in1714, and five travellers plummett to their deaths, Brother Juniper asks, "Why did this happen to those five?" Wilder proceeds to tell us the stories of these travellers & we are asked to examine whether there is any reason that God would choose these specific people for this fate.I remember reading this book in Junior High or High School and not getting it; I'm afraid I still don't. I suppose the book's well written, but I just don't care that these people die and the ultimate lesson we're left with--there is a bridge of love that binds the living and the dead--just seems completely platitudinous.
0	What am I missing? I found the book dull and unsatisfying.: I have read all the positive reviews and I am a bit stumped. I found the early chapter about the relationship between the mother and daughter very tedious and meaningless. I almost stopped reading after that chapter, but slogged on through the rest of the book with little uptick in enjoyment. I believe people just feel they have to love and praise the "classics" no matter what. I found the book dull and unsatisfying. I'm so glad it was a short book. The most enjoyable part of the book was looking up the many words I did not understand. I'm very glad I put the [...] app on my iPhone.
1	Emerson Lake & Palmer at the top of their game!: This U.K. Sony re-master is the best sounding of all there re-issues of this album, it's too bad it's being lumped with the Shout Factory version. Get this version it's just tremendous!
0	Save Your Money: I agree with Jeff's review below. The sound on this thing is horrific. It's mega-compressed and overly bright. The more they mess with this album. the worse it sounds. Go back and find the original Atlantic version...crank up your stereo...and enjoy the *dynamics* of the music.
0	recall: We obtain a vinyl disc ELP "Brain salad surgery" production Shout! factory records. The disc has on both sides of the broad transverse stripes. As Grading is similar to the Fair. It happened at the factory packaging. Although the seller advertised it as new. I would like to sent me a new drive, without damage, and even without an envelope.
0	Pfaltzgraff Dinnerware Set: One Plate already cracked. I ordered round Serving Bowl, to large! Coffee Mugs to big!
0	Could have been about skateboarding: Would appeal to out of work 20 somethings who find hooting out loud a significant expression of inner experience. Could have been subtitled "Hiking with your bar buddies, are we thirty ,yet?."Some nice footage. better vids abound.
1	Indian Territory: You cannot get much better than a good Gene Autry movie. The Quality is very good and the restoration is top notch.
1	Singable Psalms: For over ten years I have shared these settings of the Psalms with Christians and Jews in worship services. Webber's wording is creative and current. His choice of metrical patterns makes these psalms usable with literally hundreds of tunes familiar to all who worship with these ancient Hebrew poems. I could wish Webber had versified the entire Psalter, though he has included most sections regularly in use in English speaking congregations. I warmly recommend using these settings to all who love to sing, and love to sing the psalms. By choosing familiar tunes from any source, a music leader can newly invigorate several generations of worshippers.
0	Leaves much to desire: The book provides a good chart of all of the Outlook 2000 objects but gives few good programming examples. Nowhere does it show how to login as an outlook user and then create and send an email. Spends too much time on the Outlook database vs. task list as if it were the only part of Outlook a developer would be interested. Not worth the money.
0	LOVE Jim Croce, the "remastering" sucks!: The remastering makes the recording tinny & lacks depth.Sad thing to do to Jim Croce's music.This was the BEST album made, the music was originally some of the most beautiful, earthy, talented music ever recorded...There may have been some poorly remastered dicks & some not? so you might want to take a chance & see what it sounds like to you. I did NOT get mine here, so cold have been a bad run???The album is fantastic! Jim Croce died WAY too young. He was VERY talented.
1	Oustanding collection: This album was a must-have for me because of all the tracks in general and one in particular. It is also a well-made album with very good acoustic quality. "Time in a Bottle" is a special song for my wife and I. So is "I'll Have to Say I Love You in a Song"; and there are other favorites on this and other albums. In January 2011 we celebrated our 40th Anniversary with dinner at Croce's Restaurant in San Diego. (Owned by his widow Ingrid. If you are a Jim Croce fan and in or visiting San Diego, going here should be at or near the top of your to-do list.)
0	Horrible text: My daughter uses this series for sixth grade Social Studies. I think it is among the worse textbooks I have ever seen. The book is written as a narrative with no bullets, highlights, underlined points or emphasis of any kind. The problem with this is the first time reader of American History needs to know what is important and what they need to focus on. They have no base knowledge of the subject and not all fact are equal. In addition, there is no glossary which is annoying for the students when creating flash cards for assessments. I am not going to go into the inaccuracies of the text (there are quite a few) or the obvious religious biased, but I think that a more structured book is appropriate for first time American History student. This book is more of "reader" then a text- they don't even have question or a vocabulary list for each chapter.
0	Very bad quality!!! Don't buy.: Sigma watch has a very poor quality. I bought I PC7 one year ago and the first time I put it under the shower it stops working (it was supposed to be 3m water resistance). I sent to sigma and I have to pay for all transport expenses from (From China to Brazil).After1 year the battery is down and the back is rusty (I have a10 year old Casio watch that is used in swimming in pool and seawater and does not have any rusty).Don't recommend Sigma watches.
1	Fantasic HRM with all the features you need, a best buy: I have used this HRM for 4 months now and love it. I mainly use it riding my bike. Comes with a handlebar quick-mount for bike that is nice to use so can see it always without taking hands of bar.Trying to decide I found Polar (and others) had too many models and they carefully structured features/price to make you spend $50 to $150 more. This HRM has a ton of features (all that I need) and a great flexible display. I don't think it has a light.While working I like to display the Heart menu so I can see % of max constantly and a % graph and my current HR. It's easy to move thru the menus and see all the info. Keeps a running tally of calories, I think I burned 20,000 so far.The Sigma Sport website is very well done and shows all the info you need to decide. This is a best buy.
1	Tarzan rocks: My son had this game when he was young and I just loved to play it. This copy does try to act up on me a little but with patience, I can get it working. I love this game!
1	A poigant book: This book was wonderful when I read it as a child, and now when I read it. It's incredible, a very grown up tale , yet it can be read at any age. Rumer Godden is a wonderful author, and this book will capture your heart like nothing else - except maybe The Mouse and his Child. It is the story of a family living in The DollHouse, and learning to come to terms with themselves, it is both happy and sad........but ultimately rewarding.
0	Very disturbing book: I have to agree with the others who warn that this book is unsuitable for children. In fact, I'm researching this book online today because just now (in my early 30s) I suddenly had a flashback to the horrible scene of Birdie's burning. I read this book when I was in 4th or 5th grade and, like others have said, the sickening feeling it gave me-- not just the burning scene, but the ugliness of the whole moral universe of that book-- has stuck with me all these years. It's *not* that I believe in coddling and sheltering children from the harsh realities of life. I read plenty of books as a child that featured cruelty, heartlessness and violence, and *none* of them disturbed me as deeply as this one did. Based on my first-hand experience of how this book reads from the perspective of a child, I wholeheartedly advise parents not to subject their children to it. There are better choices.
1	Strange, strange book...: I am unable to categorize this book. As the title says, this is about advanced Perl programming, but chapter1-9 really belongs in "Programming Perl" (but are totally missing from it), and should really not be considered advanced (on the other hand, quite elementary, but since they appear nowhere else, you should probably consider this book a must read, if you are serious about Perl).The rest of the book is pretty random, covering various topics the author thought was neat, and wanted to write about. This is ranging from trivial use of CPAN libraries (Tk), to trivial Perl but involving knowledge from other disciplines (networking), to actual useful advanced Perl programming (persistence, template-driven code-generation, and the C programming interface). This part of the book is also highly recommended (and in fact the reason I bought it), but should have been much longer.
1	Excellent Resource: O'Relly books are generally great sources and this one is no exception. I've been programming with Perl for CGI, NetAdmin, SysAdmin, and various data tasks for almost 4 years. Anybody who knows Unix will know a lot more by knowing Perl and advanced Perl takes you to the next level. Tell archie to stop whining and cop to his real name...
0	Short-Lived: When it worked, it was great: easy to use, and easy to clean.The problem is that the power started cutting out, less than six months after purchase. The problem appeared to be with the power cord itself. I kept my receipt, filled out the warranty card, etc, thinking that if I had a problem, GE would honor the one-year warranty, which is suppose to replace any part which is defective...no such luck.First of all, you are expected to take it to a GE servicer, and pick it up later, or else you have to pay a fee to have it serviced in your home. Then I was given the run-around because they tried to say the cord was damaged after it was delivered to the store that sold it, but the store said it was GE's responsibility.Basically, don't buy this microwave if you expect GE to honor the warranty. I ended up buying another brand from a different store to avoid this scenario again.I recommend theEmerson .9 cu. ft. 900-Watt Microwave -.
0	Poor Quality: I don't recommend this microwave. Think it only lasted about a year. A little over...spend a little more and get something that will last longer. Evidently the parts on this were not made to last long. One day it just started being really noisy and no cooking think that says the magnetron (microwave producing element) was dead. I am glad i did not review after purchase coz now can let folks know it is not made to last...I will get another brand this time around!
0	HORRIBLE!!!: I bought these last spring for trapping and they lasted the one week I trapped muskrats with just a small leak, I thought i just went over the top of them a little bit. Then I took them out for smallmouths a few weeks later and I found the leak. Then this fall trapping muskrats and raccoon this fall they just completely fell apart the soles started falling off, they had big rips near the calf, and the part that attaches to your belt broke, and the next day the other one fell off! So I had to spend the rest of the week in leaky falling down pieces of crap! I would never recommend this to anyone! It is just a horrible product. I would not even buy another Hodgman product. I was so dissatisfied with this do not buy it.
0	Waste of money: These waders only lasted three outings. They were always rinsed off after use, hung to dry, then stored properly, stuffed with newspaper. By the beginning of the fourth outing, the left boot had cracked, where the foot flexes at the toes. By the end of the trip, the right one had cracked in the same spot. They aren't worth the money, or the soaked feet.
1	A starter for any potential Orb fan!: I remember the first time I heard an Orb song. It was during one of my weekened/midnight excursions around Dallas and they played "Fluffy Little Clouds" I got the weirdest sensation when I first listend to this song. Felt like someone was lightly running the tip of a very cold knife up and down my spine. I LIKED IT! So I ran out and grabbed this particular album. Some of the songs grabs you immediately. Others take time to grow on you.Having said that if you get any of their other albums, don't expect the same. Expect DIFFERENT....very different styles and samplings.I give it 4 in stead of 5, because I'm hoping for a better album when it comes out.
1	A great album: This is a really nice ambient album, the kind of album you can close your eyes and think while listening to it, also a good album to go to sleep to. If you like ambient music buy it, if you haven't heard ambient buy it to see what ambient is.
0	Your10-year-old brother with a trance track: Once again I've been suckered by glowing reviews into purchasing an album that could have been made by an auto plant robot. It's basically the opening track of "Dark Side of the Moon" overlaid with old newscast voices and your little brother blowing bubbles through his straw. The best I can say for this is that it's not as obnoxious as Lesiem's "Mystic Spirit Voices." I'm sticking with Steve Roach.
0	USB connection in tablet fails.: I bought this tablet and at first it worked fine. However after a couple of months it started failing. I would plug it in and nothing would happen - as if it's not connecting. Juggling the cord where it attached to the tablet would cause the light to flash on and off and if you held it 'just right' it would work... for a few minutes.Now it simply does not work at all.Other than that it worked fairly well when it worked. I did not like the included software - it was difficult to use and looked 'kludgy' to me.I suppose you get what you pay for...
1	Sounds immediately attracted my 7 year old Grandson: The musical sounds immediately attracted the attention of my 7 year old Grandson. It is a charming disc and one worth purchasing.
0	great propoganda: This book is a great example for teaching children about the pilgrims and everything they believed in such as religious freedom (except if you weren't a god fearing christian) and settling new frontiers (AKA conquering territory and making already settled people miserable) Hats off to the author for this book glorifying an essentially moronic culture.
0	A decent mug, but it has poor insulation: If you like to drink your coffee fast, this is the mug for you! Even with preheating, coffee only stays hot for 2 hours. The outside of the mug feels warm immediately after filling. I expected better performance. Other features are fine such as the stylish look and tight seal, but for an extra five bucks you can get a top of the line travel mug that performs its core function better.
0	Doesn't flow; big disappointment: I had the prior version of this mug and loved it. As other posters have noted, Trudeau unfortunately changed the design of the lid for the worse. The new lid, which screws into the mug, does not permit an adequate flow of the coffee when it is in the open position. Drinking it while I drove my car, I had to literally lean my head back and use gravity to get enough coffee to come out. That lead to the coffee leaking onto my shirt (which I should have seen coming). I tried to loosen the screw on the bottom of the lid as others mentioned, but I still can't get enough coffee to come out of it when it's in the open position. I don't have the same problems with it leaking that some others have mentioned, but that just tells me that this is an inconsistent, poorly made product.
0	Disappointed: When I try to drink from the cup very little of the liquid comes out. I tried to adjust screw of lid as was suggested. It worked but next time I used it it went back to allowing very little of liqui to come out. I like the design etc but the lid is not good for drinking from.
0	The reviews are for the wrong performance!: The performance is, according to the description, by Jansug Kakhidze, Tbilisi Symphony Orchestra, not Rattle. What's going on? Did I download Kakhidze or Rattle? It would be nice to know. The performance I heard sounded pretty lightweight compared to others I've heard, but I don't know who's performance I heard.
0	Only symbols and images, no concepts!: This book does tell you some essential things about LINUX, but this is not enough at all. Being surrounded by pictures and tips, I really can't learn anything that concerns the main part of LINUX. It is no better than a thickened Redhat user's manual! Too Pratical! If you really want to "LEARN" LINUX, you'd better go and buy RUNING LINUX which is far better than this book!
1	Classic!: I first heard about Larry from the Blue Collar Comedy Tour. The thing I like best about Larry is he shows you can be funny without cursing and making sex jokes left-and-right. I think most commedians curse just to get people in the audience.Larry is funny, and you don't have to be raised in the South to appreciate him, though it couldn't hurt.
1	Excellent book, worth buying.: "Cats for Dummies is a book for any cat lover or owner. I recommend it.
1	It takes a lot of time and practice: The graphics in this game were somewhat bad, but the game itself is very amusing. Some levels are fun and some make you want to tear your hair out. I like the fact that Bugs Bunny literally lives on 6 hit points (from what I remember) and basically infinite lives. There were ton of levels in the game where it takes a lot of time and practice to get right and sometimes they become frustrating. It actually took me years to finally complete this game one time. As a kid and even for adults, this game is enjoyable.
1	...Here's To One More...: Not often does an indie band make such a hugh impression, but impressions aren't everything it seems nowadays.Why isn't this band huge? It doesn't always require a major label to get the job done. There is just enough radio friendly catchyness here to make an impact.Maybe that's why it's not really nessecary, these songs in this album stand together or alone so perfectly balancing one another that it demands to be listened to from track one to ten. Female vocals occasionally finding there way in add such a depth, a relaztion to the songs, that you stop everything and just listen. These songs aren't dancehall or heavy metal, but this album proves the potential of dramatic freeform rock, which isn't in your face.My hat goes off to Lydia, but no 5 stars sadly in my book, becuase I felt like they could've done so much more here. Every song feels ready to be implanted with the growth of something more, but it just never happens.Can't wait to hear more.
1	Excellent Reference for BIND version 4: This Book is a must have for anyone seriously doing DNS work today. The upcoming 3rd edition will cover BIND Version 8, but the substance of DNS and how it works on the Internet is fully and delightfully covered in both previous editions.The Authors are completely knowledgeable about DNS and share that knowledge in a straighforward comfortable style that makes DNS & BIND a fun read while imparting loads of DNS wisdom.
0	Great idea...too much errata: I bought this book thinking it would be a nice kick-start to ASP and Visual InterDev. I was wrong.If you don't have programing know-how the the consistant errata and lack of coding standards will cause you to not get past Day1.The coding, which standards change from day to day, leaves out important details, chnages methods in doing the same tasks, and if you type it directly from the book, will cause your programs from Day 2 on to not work correctly.The amount of errata makes what could have been a good book a sub-standard one, and what is worse is that the Author only lists 2 errata on his website, when I found multiple errata throughout the book...at least 2-3 per 'day'.Stick with a WROX beginners book and you'll fair much better and save yourself some frustration.I've been programing for over10 years, and without my previous knowledge, I would have never figured out the errors in the coding.
0	Arabian Prince bombs on his comeback CD...: I got this CD not too long ago, I expected songs similar to the album 'Brother Arab', but Arabian Prince changed up his style. Now he used slow synthed strings, and more sexual lyrics then before. He found another rapper named Side Show to help back him up, probably because Arabian Prince wasn't use to this kind of rap style. The album had the gangsta beat with too much emphasis on b-tches and f----n. There are maybe three tracks that are enjoyable to listen to, but the other ones sound to repetitive or just too slow. The highlight of the album is the song "Underworld" when Arabian Prince brings back a fast tempo song about the ghetto. The best slow-synth song would be "Ho's 2 Bozack". A.Prince brings a lot of the NWA's production crew to make the album. I don't have the import version of this album, but i think there are maybe one or two bonus songs.
1	Excellent production of a classic story: If you enjoyed Good Bye Mr Chips and Harry Potter, you'll enjoy this moving saga of a former soldier, shattered by the horrors of trench warfare, who finds his true calling in teaching at a British boarding school between the World Wars.
1	Five Easy Gardens- Anyone can grow the prime...: This book is an invaluable asset in showing the home grower something that all the other books virtually overlook, a production budget! Each easy garden is detailed with step-by-step, and itemized list of components with cost, and typical output. The reader can determine which methods most resemble something they could achieve... This will move all growers that are getting started in the right direction.We, at Spice of Life Seeds, routinely advise new growers to purchase one of Señor Cervantes books. They are never disappointed. All the Best to Jorge, and I look forward to his next releases.
0	Out of date: There are still some sound principles in this book, but it's a decade old and you can get all of the same information but updated and in full color in Jorge's other books.Jorge should either update this book or take it out of print because there are a dozen other better books on growing, including his own.I returned this book after reading a few chapters...
1	good for sensitive skin: truly good, this product is light weight and not at all greasy. It is pretty good on very sensitive skin, and after i used it the first night there was a noticeable difference in my acne, like they were reduced and my skin felt much softer. Great product.
1	Good old fashioned entertainment: First of all, the only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is that the sound quality is a bit variable; some episodes are better than others. But given the age of the original recordings and the necessary transfer to the new format, I can't complain. This is a ripping yarn of the best quality, each part about15 minutes long, so I find it great for filling in those short breaks in my day when I have a half hour to kill. The story is damn close to the original book by Sax Rohmer, and it works really well as a serial. Don't expect political correctness, though! If you want a good old fashioned adventure yarn with some creepy overtones, give it a go. (And the company do a buy one get one free for overseas customers)
1	Great band: Why didn't I heard about this band?Back in the seventies listened STYX,KANSAS,SUPERTRAMP and the likes,but I never heard about ANGEL. Thanks for these reissues I accidentally stumbled on them.What a treat.All 4 albums are great and if you like seventies music,you must buy ANGEL. they A RE FANTASTIC.
1	Dark and disturbing: Intense, riveting look at the heroin business, as cops Patric and Jason-Leigh get sucked into their under cover roles. Look fast for Greg Allman as a smack dealer. But be warned, this movie has got some real unhappy moments!!!
1	A drug movie that's really a love story: I like this movie. I saw it years ago when it first came out and it really "stayed with me." The thought of having to immerse yourself in the drug culture to do your job, and then finding it so difficult not to succumb to the addiction. Very powerful story. Not a feel good movie, but one that you can definitely get personally involved in!
1	Red Hart Magic: This book gives insight into the history of England during one of its turblent periods. It also gives a clear look at the problems facing children in new and strange circumstances. It is great reading for early teens.
0	boring: I am a confirmed obsessive Linkin Park fan. I personally found this a bit boring. This is unauthorized so it did not have enough of the band contributing to the project.
1	White Plasti Dip: I use this product to cover my metal flower baskets that hang in my garden. I wish that it covered better and I didn't have to spray so many coats. Very time-consuming and uses product up quickly. However, does the job and I will purchase again.
1	Outdoor thermometer: The Thermometer itself seems to be a good product, but there was no protective packaging in the box; therefore the thermometer arrived with a broken piece (which fortunately my husband was able to superglue back on).
1	outdoor thermometer: pleased with the size of the numbers....easy to read and the accuracy of the temp is reasonabley close to weather reports.
0	it stopped working accurately!!!: I had one similar for many years that was accurate until someone's dog jumped up and knocked if off the fence breaking it. I bought this to replace it, however, I can't imagine how this can't work unless it is made of really shoddy materials. It reads way off the correct temperature as told by my radio controlled weather station.My advice - don't buy it. The manufacturers will get the message eventually and make a decent product. As long as we are buying and putting up with shoddy goods they will keep producing them making us part of the problem!!!
0	Disappointed: I ordered this thermometer as a gift for my mom and didn't even give it too her. It felt flimsy and cheap.
1	Misunderstood?: I've read a lot of negative reviews about this film, but I absolutely love it. Can't really tell you why - the music, the characters, the way all the characters mesh, the storyline. I also happen to love a few of these actors - Keven Kline, Steve Martin and Danny Glover, people who always make a film enjoyable for me, no matter what surrounds them. I guess I just want to say, if you've read a few negative reviews, please be aware that not everybody hates this film. You may want to give it a try, and you may actually enjoy it.
0	a real piece of junk: This is the worst mop I have ever owned! I really expected better. Now I understand why the replacement sponges were in the closeout store. They are wonderful, if they would just stay on the handle. I contacted the manufacturer and the replacement mop they provided is just as bad. The replacement is not cellulose sponge and does not clean the floor. I give up on Mr Clean mop products.
0	Worst mop ever!: It doesn't pick up the grime just moves it around...you think you get quality when buying a trusted name such as Mr. Clean. I can't believe this is on shelves...
0	SUCKS! SPONGE WONT STAY ON!: This product sucks. The sponge that pops in really easily also POPS BACK OUT even more easily.Basically you get a mope handle that assembles fairly easily and no mop to go with it.
1	Again I have the movie/book/and tape series...use them in class: The first time I read this I knew this was perfect for teacher, coaches, counselors the whole smear...never a better book written except maybe the bible/or Vince Lombardi's Run To Daylight.
1	"A Voice Many Seek but Few Ever Hear": I first came across the works of Denis Waitley in late1996, as I began my first steps towards entrepreneurship. It was via audio tape, which contained most if not all of the contents of this book, nonetheless, here was a complete stranger telling Me: I could succeed, I could achieve, I could do things - encouragement I was not getting from my immediate family, my peers, my "friends" at that time.Someone once said: You will become like the information you input into your mind and the people you associate with. If that's the truth, then, I am indeed one step closer to where I wish to be in my life, and YOU can be there, too.
0	The Psychology of Winning: Your ad made it look like I was purchasing the actual book, The Psychology of Winning.What you sent me was some cheap workbook that was of absolutely NO use to me. I was extremely disappointed
1	cd review: The classic Oscar Peterson Trio makes jazz music like no other and the quality of this re-mastering is exceptional. As an audiophile I can't recommend this cd highly enough. It has become one of my reference cd's. The opening cut has some of the best recorded bass I've ever heard and the other instruments are equally well represented. Buy and enjoy.
0	really for dummies...: It was my first "for dummies" book and most probably the last. The book is big and empty; the author should have used at most 50 pages. The CD contains short musical clips that you've probably heard before or you can download for free. I gave it two stars because the book actually helps a small tiny bit contrary to its size.I recommend instead "Alfred's Group Piano for Adults" it's much better but I'm not sure if it's the best one out there.
0	Look elsewhere.: Even though the book does embody several hints on playing the piano, two stars are still generous. The book lacks coherency and is a mind-dulling read at best. Constant attempts at humor make for twitching and disgust. It is hard to stay focused and interested in this book, no matter how ambitious the pianist. There are other great books out there that demonstrate the piano beautifully and that have a much stronger appeal. My recommendation is to keep looking and don't stop here.
0	Who's the Dummy?: I bought this book out of curiosity rather than as a teaching guide as I already play the piano to grade 8 (ABRSM).I wish I had not bothered and kept my14.99. The book is written by a dummy for dummies or more aptly by a moron for morons. The incessant attempt at humour is offputting from the start and the content is disjointed and lacks any conceptual ideas of what music and the piano is really about.The CD accompanying the book is a joke, and if this is an example of the author's musical skill I shudder to think what else he has produced. The irritating keyboard rhythms and styles are a throw back to the Bontempi school of music.IMO this book is pants and is not worthy to carry the name Piano in its title. Save your money and don't buy it, there are lots of other very good "easy books" on teaching beginners the piano.
0	Worse remake than Planet of the Apes, Godzilla, or Oh.. Just any of them: Please people, stop going to see remakes. If we stop going, they will stop making them. Jackson's Kong was worse than the 70's remake of Kong. Much worse. I agree100% with Floyd the Barber's review. The only thing I will add is that the scene in NYC when Kong finds Anne in the backlite street is a contender for top 2 worst movie moments in history. The audience I saw this with laughed out loud at this moment. I had serious high hopes for this film. I went to the midnight opening for pete's sake. But just like the new Star Wars films these hack filmmakers have let the public down. Most people in this country don't have health care. But they waste millions of dollars on crap films like this. So my call to action is to not give them any more of our hard earned money. Ban all remakes. Tell Hollywood to get new ideas or get out! Thank you, that is all.
1	tremendous!!!: Just go see it!! Art for the sake of art. please ignore sierocks review...the message of the film is beyond him!!
0	Silly and Too Dramatic: I love the other films Peter Jackson has made. The best is Heavenly Creatures, if you have not seen this movie your missing out! I thought this movie was overly dramatic and to long. Had many unbeliveable moments and was so far fetched! The only cool thing about it was the natives, they were freaky.
1	Spectacular!: Peter Jackson takes the metaphor, if you can bring an unprecedented find to the world for the price of an admission ticket, you've got a spectacular show. And King Kong delivers on the premise in sheer scope, cenematic beauty, and bigger-than life story. The production was phenomenal in almost every way. In one instance, when Kong was sliding autos around the streets of Broadway, like a kid crashing matchbox cars, did the action look like CG creation (something in the sliding ape didn't look convincing). In every other scene, the work was awesome, detailed, and completely credibly produced.Watch for character nuances in the non-speaking CG role of Kong, and you'll see another reason this 3rd-generation remake justifies the hype it got. Kong is a sympathetic character with a soft spot for Ann Darrow. Worth the 3 hours of pure enjoyment.
1	Great But Not Quite Five Stars: This movie was excellent. It borrows a lot from the original with incredible special effects and amazing recreations of1931 New York! King Kong finally moves like a real gorilla and the destruction that gets wrecked throughout the movie is very convincing! The natives of this movie look like something out of the Exorcist although there was a tribute to the original natives during the scene where Kong is displayed to the New York public at the theater.There are a lot more dinousaurs in this one including a lot of prehistoric insect creatures that look convincingly real. I didn't give it 5 stars for the following reasons:- many of the scenes seemed to be excruciatingly long- I was not crazy about Jack Black's portrayal of Carl Denham- I may have been a little bit prejudiced having seen the original so I knew exactly what was going to happen. I am sure people being introduced to Kong for the first time will love it!
0	King Kong & Bionic Woman: Close to 4.30 hours long in which more than half of it were entirely useless and have no relevance to the movie specifically that bombastic CGI Lost World scene. The scenes defies logic and reality with all those acrobatic stunts of Naomi Watts by Kong even a solid unripe hard cucumber would end up mushy. It is totally incomprehensible that our heroine ended up with no bruises, no welts and unbroken bones. Another failed attempt to create a modern epic with an intended complete menu which ended up a spoiled meal.
1	Kong, the Miniseries: They should have just made this a miniseries and then they would have been able to have more side stories and characters that they seemed to want. BUT, they put it all in one movie. Overall, good movie, there are some tense moments (dinosaur chase, bug attack)..and it all reminded me of Jurrassic Park. King Kong was animated really well, but everything else was kind of wierd looking and you could tell it was green screen behind them (but I guess that's what they were looking for). You may find yourself forwarding most scenes just to get through this without going crazy. Recommend - - but forward through slow parts.
1	Best King Kong yet: I loved the first King Kong movie in black & white. But this movie was for me more enjoyable because of the special effects. The dinosaur fights were excellent. I loved the developement with King Kong as having a personality and the interaction between him and the girl. She even uses her vaudville act on Kong and he pretends to not be ammused but she wins him over eventually. Black is OK as the promoter of the adventure to find the mysterious island. He is a bit of a ham and overacts at times but that is his nature. He acts with the intensity of a Tom Cruise but just doesn't have quite Tom's magnetism. I would have given the movie 5 stars but they could have cut short the human eating giant insect scene in the chasm. The scene lasted over ten minutes (or seemed like it) and makes the movie out of reach of most children to enjoy. The old King Kong was accessable to all age groups something lost in this new one. However I still loved this movie.
1	KING BONG !: Great movie in HD. Almost as good as the theater. But I had to go to a freinds house to watch it because it wouldnt play (obviously) on my standard DVD player nor (curiously) my Bluray player hmmmmmmmm.... You should probably mention that in the HD descriptions, My bad ;(
0	Visually stunning. But a terriable movie: BORING. LONG. It stars Jack Black, which automatically makes it bad. But the drawn-out story just makes it worse.On the positive side, it looks good. HD-DVD is a winner. And the fairly reasonably priced XBox 360 HD-DVD adapter is well worth every penny.
0	Too much of a CGI fest: Just watched KK for the first time. Unaware of the pointless nature of most of the film. I never believed that any of the characters had any personal business on Skull Island.The bugs, dinosaurs, and weird evil natives were as overdone as burnt toast that sets off the smoke alarm. There were too few scenes that would give the movie any positive spin. You know bad guys smashed or something. The point of the movie according to Mr. Jackson was that bugs, people, and dinosaurs are evil and that KK is an overgrown primate trapped in world that tortures him daily and finally kills him. Oh, yeah the movie is great if you would like a CGI headache.
0	Over-Rated, Cheesy, Boring, Corny, OVER-RATED!: By the time everyone gets to Skull Island you are bored. Jurassic Park showed us ground-breaking dinosaur CGI and we were scared by the dinosaurs.Seeing a bloated Jack Black outrun a RAPTOR, while holding his hat onto his head, was more hokey than hokey. I was laughing at how the dinosaurs were flying by everyone (with less than an inch between them) in the stampede.No one seemed at all "surprised" by the fact that they ended up on an island filled with prehistoric life.The bug cavern scene was neat, which is why this gets1 star.Why would Adrian Brody's character go off on his own? Did the bugs decide to ignore him? No one wondered off on their own in Jurassic Park.
1	AN INSTANT CLASSIC!: This was incredible. I cannot wait for this to come on DVD. I liked this a little beter than Peter Jackson's Lord Of The Rings.
1	Fun but not Classic: Not exactly Peter Jacksons best work but for what it lacks in acting and editing it makes up for in its CG and its fun action. On bluray it pops and u have yourself a fun popcorn movie.
0	Largely Irrelevant Scholasticism: After having lived in Cambodia for 2 years and having read several books on Cambodian religion and Buddhism in general, I approached this book with great anticipation. I read it over the course of 3 months, writing a review of each chapter and discussing each chapter in a forum.Generally, I found this book to be of little value in understanding "New Religious Movements in Cambodia." The authors demonstrate a noted lack of philosophical self-awareness and thus interpret Cambodian religion through a post-Enlightenment humanistic grid. If you want to know how a Cambodian views his religion, this book is not for you.Several of the chapters are written poorly to the point that the thesis is almost unintelligible. Fortunately, the introduction to each section states in clear terms what the thesis of each chapter is. Highly scholastic work does not need to be difficult to read. This book often is.Chapters 3, 5 and 7 are worthwhile, so it will remain on my shelf.
0	Doesn't work: I plugged it in to my machine. Windows made "Chirp" sound it makes when I plug in a flash drive, and the little green icon in the lower right showed up, that I click to removed the drive, and the J drive appeared in my Folders pane in Windows. But when I clicked on the J drive, I got an error message saying "Please insert a disk into Drive J".Doesn't work. POS.
1	The BEST bread flour I have ever used!: The 50 lbs bag arrived in just a few days.. $4.95 shipping is unbeatable. I bagged it n1 gallon plastic bags and packed them into a large lard can to keep fresh.. the container is now in our root cellar. For my first loaf I tried a basic French Bread recipe that includes beaten egg whites added to the water.. no oil.. just flour, sugar, yeast, water, salt.. and, from1lb 4 oz of flour I produced the most awesome, seriously authentic French style baguettes (x2) that I have EVER made! I have no idea what makes this unbleached flour so special, but I'm not looking back!
1	I love him: IT WAS CCCCCRACK!!!i love him and the album i think that it was betta lyrically then from me to u~but i love santana and the whole movement ever since it start i loved cam back when he was with mase so i am a dipset fan but really its good
0	Juelz should be missing his tongue: Yes the game has been missing the constant songs about drugs, girls, cars and jewelery. I tell you Juelz really came with an original formula with this album. The stuff he mentions on this one has never been said before and Juelz is an innovator as well as the rest of the dipset. LOL!!!! These guys listen to other peoples albums and just reiterate the same stuff in a different song and beat. Save your money.
1	MUST HAVE!: Awsome movie! Colorful! Entertaining! Funny and Sad! You will never get tired watching it over and over again!
1	It's A Wonderful Life: This is an awesome and timeless classic for the entire family. Just when you think you're life isn't going so well, watch this movie and it reminds you of what really is important in life. I recommend it highly and it's a great addition to your movie library.
1	One of the Greatest Christmastime Movies of All Time!: I've loved this movie since I first saw it when I was10 years old. Danny Kaye and Bing Crosby are two of the greatest actors that ever lived! My sister and I love to sing along with the "Sisters" song. (Speaking of which, if anyone knows where I can get a copy of that music please email me at ChristineDaae19@hotmail.com. My sister and I are looking for it for a variety show that we're doing for our church.) But seriously, it's one of the greatest Christmas musicals I've ever seen! The dancing and singing are spectacular and the songs are catchy. You might find yourself going around humming songs from that. This movie is a definite buy for those who love old musicals and want to get into the Christmas spirit.
1	White Christmas DVD: My mom and I would watch this movie every year when I was growing up. It just did not seem like Christmas until we watched White Christmas.
0	Terrible transfer: bad color alignment and often audio sync issues.: Unfortunately the DVD I purchased is worse than my aging VHS copy of this wonderful film. The color on this copy is out of alignment, resulting in a double film image (a separation between color and black-and-white). Bing's "baby blues" are lower than were they're supposed to be and hairlines (especially in the beginning when the men are in uniform) have a large color gap where you can see black and white (almost as if this were a colorized black and white film). I also had some trouble with the audio sync. I may have a bad copy, given all the good reviews but clearly this DVD is unwatchable! Big disappointment. I am returning it for a refund.
1	One of the best Christmas movies: One of the best Christmas movies. Our family has been decorating our Christmas Trees for over 20 years, and this is the movie that we watch each time. We needed to get it on DVD because the VCR version probably won't last much longer.
1	My favorite holiday movie: Such a deal getting it as a digital download. It will always be available when I need it! doesn't clutter up the DVD shelf for the remaining11 months of the year.
1	Great Classic!: A must-see for the Christmas season! I love Rosemary Clooney. Danny Kaye is wonderful in this movie - fun music.
1	good movie: I havent seen this one yet but my wife says its a good one so I bought it on her behalf. thank you amazon
0	The critics are right -- this movie isn't very good.: This is a subtle pro-war film that has nothing to do with Christmas. I can't believe Irving Berlin himself liked it. There are only a few things that make it worth watching. (1) Grady Sutton, who doesn't get nearly enough lines or screen time; (2) the quartet singing "Snow" in the dining car of the train; (3) the outfit Rosemary Clooney is wearing when she gets on the train as she "runs" away from Bing Crosby; and (4) Bing Crosby's apparent self-consciousness as he is undressing in front of Danny Kaye while being talked into following the girls (watch for it -- he hurriedly pulls his shirt down so the camera won't reveal the fact that he's wearing briefs!!!). Aside from all that, a real depressing movie.
1	It's a Wonderful Life: A Christmas classic. All these years later, life can still be the same as in this movie. Lot's of us are always striving, longing for a "better" more exciting life and many times if we stepped back and looked at ours it couldn't get any better, we just need to appreciate what we have and make the best of our life.
1	good movie: Loved the movie I haden't see it for at least 20 years and it still managed to entertain and delite me, a must see for all ages.
0	DULL, SLOW AND DULL: Good premise but slow snail pace slow and dull. The acting is stiff and uncomfortable. The story line could have been interesting if they had decided it was a comedy or drama.I know black men dating white women is accepted but white men dating black women is still taboo so the movie had potential but it just doesn't make any magic happen. The two leads don't even act as if they are comfortable with each other. Donald Fasion was the comic relief and he was good...but he was the only good thing about this movie. Rent it don't buy it.
1	Perfect.: This movie was WITTY, HILARIOUS, SEXY, and just WELL *DONE*!After seeing terrible movies like Beauty Shop which shamelessly and hypocritically use and abuse racial stereotypes, I was apprehensive about seeing a movie about interracial dating....I was so *more* than pleasantly surprised with "Something New."Sanaa Lathan hits the comedic notes perfectly and Simon Baker is a refreshing (and beautiful) face on the screen. Though it follows the general formula of any romance comedy, it definitely has a unique edge. I enjoyed every moment and was sad to see the movie end.DEFINITELY SEE IT!
1	Pretty good starter set: Like several posters have mentioned, these are a great, inexpensive, stylish set.I give it 4/5 because the steak knives are not one piece knives.
0	I thought kitchenaid was a good name,was I wrong: I just recieved my knife set 4 days ago.Last night a knife was left in the sink and it rusted.What is up with that.I would recommend not getting this product.The knife set I had at $60.00 never rusted in the10 years I had them.Shame on you kitchenaid for selling bad products.
0	Tailgate Grill - FAIL!!!: I will open with the expected "DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT". I ordered this grill for the first weekend of college football. The weather outside was nice, low 60's, light wind, sunny. I set the grill up with a new full16 oz. Coleman propane tank. After setting (and keeping) the grill to high, it took multiple attempts to keep the grill lit, despite the low wind. After 20 minutes the grill was still not hot, but I put on my1/4 lb hamburger patties. After mulitple attempts to keep the grill protected from any breeze, including putting the grill in the trunk of the car (do not try this at home), I pulled my burgers off after AN HOUR AND A HALF (1.5 hours). Despite this amount of time on the "grill" the meat was still raw and I went through an entire canister of propane. There was nothing else I could do to help this grill cook, short of breathing on it. Spend the extra money for a better grill!
0	There is a useful part: Although it was probably not worth the price of admission his discussion on preventing bugs was useful. Essentially, if you have1 week to do 2 weeks work you will produce buggy code.To avoid deadline stress like this he recommends a system for estimating work that consists of estimating what it would take if you could write it off the top of your head and giving it a factor from0 to 5? for how unaquainted with the component techniques you are. Then raise your intitial estimate to this power to get your estimate for how long you will take for this task.However, I agree with all the other criticisms.2 stars. Not absolutely aweful but I could write better.
0	QUALITY CONTROL PROBLEMS: I recently purchased the Maxxima 2 LED Night Light with White Lens (Pack of 2), and unfortunately I had the same quality control problem which several other customers have highlighted in their reviews of this product. The night lights are quite bright (which I wanted) and the soft white shades provide a nice quality of lighting. HOWEVER, the first time I plugged one in to the outlet, there was a flash and the smell of smoke - the night light shorted out and was dead. The second nightlight worked properly, but a 50% faulty rate is unacceptable. I also would agree with the other customers who commented that the "High" and "Low" illumination settings are not very different, the "Low" setting should be much dimmer than it is. Until the quality control issues are resolved, I would not recommend purchase of this item.
1	Human Resource Management: The book was in great condition and the delivery was timely. I am completely satisified.
1	This game is soooooo AWESOME!!!!!!!: I got this game for christmas. It was actually the only computer game I got for christmas. What I like to do is mix dif herbivores in the same exhibit (e.g. Savannah herbivores together). You get higher ratings from the guests if you do it that way. Another game I recommend is The Hobbit. Except you fight the animals instead of taking care of them. All in all, this is a terrific game!
1	Springfield13 Inch Thermometer: Nice and easy to read from a distance. Very lightweight. It does what it is advertised to do.
1	Like the Springfield Thermometer: We've only been using it for a few weeks at a school but it seems like it's pretty close to the correct temperature that another thermometer I have reads. I like how it has the humidity so you can figure out the "feels like" temperature and having the wind chill reading is good too.
0	Buy a mercury Thermo for accuracy ...: This thermometer registers temperature based on a metalic coil on the back of the unit. Mine read 4 to 7 degrees to low. The humidity indicator, as others have commented, simply doesn't work.Otherwise, it was an attractive ornament.I just threw it in the trash.If you want to know the temperature, I recommend the dual mercury thermometer for $10, including prime shipping, Reed MM2 Max-Min Analog Thermometer, -40 to120 Degrees F.You can't see it across the yard, but it's accurate.
0	Lame: I really hate when a writer true to write a military based book with little to no research, he couldn't even get the ranks right.
0	Not very complete. Too many ActiveX controls missing.: Don't believe the book's cover. The reference is not even a quarter complete. Many ActiveX controls are missing. Where are the references for the database? Why include Usercontrol references in the book when even the Winsock control is not covered? The source code examples in the CD are next to useless. Why call this book the #1 Definitive Master reference???? I want my money back.
1	malts for my son: Just the right mallets at a good price. Could not find any locally so Amazon was the next best place to easily find them.
1	Reflective Tape: The product seems to work as suggested! I received it on time and I'm very happy with it's application.Thankschris
1	Safety first... and second...: Great product. Used it to make a few things just a bit more safe as well as to cover faux chrome making it not only black but reflective as well.
0	It just wouldn't run: My hw is overkill for the game. It seemed to install just fine. And then it just wouldn't run. Click on the icon and nothing happened. There was no help anywhere for it. I checked all the "fixes" online and nothing worked. I've worked for VAR's troubleshooting PC's for a living and I couldn't get it to run. I'd give it0 stars if I could.
0	Don't bother unless you prefer single player: If you enjoy single player only, then it's a great game.However if you intended to play multiplayer, don't bother.The server has been down repeatedly. The game gives you "xp" , or experience points, which decides which level Home City you have.At this point in time, if you're one of the lucky ones, you will receive the xp you have earned, most of us however, haven't received our xp.Under the chat browser, there are chat rooms listed that promise ways to fix the xp problem, however the ES people then say there is no way to fix them, yet they leave the chat rooms so people remain confused.There are only a few hundred people average on the server, the most it's hit is probably1,110, while early morning US hours, there are usually around 30-40 people...If ES can't handle so few people, what are they going to do when more people try to join?
0	Bad graphics: I still play AOE1 because the graphics are so simple it doesnt hert your eyes to play it for hours. I didnt like the graphics in AOE 2, and after reading all these reviews I dont think i will buy AOE 3. I advise AOE team to make it simple, but fun. (for example dont use green but light brown in the background
0	Age of Empires III: We were never able to use the game, because it is not compatible with most computers. check your computer specification before buy it.
0	Not ready for prime time: I have a 4 GHz machine with 2 Mb of RAM and GeForce4 graphics card. I have no difficulty running lots of games at high resolution. But this game runs so slowly that it is unplayable -- even at the default screen resolution (1024x800).That resolution is another problem. I have a 21" plasma monitor so anything less than1600x1200 resolution is blurry. When I tried to use1600x1200 it was so slow that I thought it had crashed.In addition the screen scrolling is almost impossible to use because it is so jerky and delayed.
0	Age of Empires III: I can not get it to work on my windows XP or Windows 7 machines. It arrived quickly and in good shape.
0	Just a big let down: I've loved AOE since the first installment and had been looking forward to AOE 3 for years. Unfortunately it turns out to be a huge dissapointment. Everyone else has mentioned the bugs and ridiculous system requirements to get the game working properly but these aside, the gameplay is just truly awful. I AOE 2, you could build a large, realistic looking and balanced army, in AOE 3 its just a rabble of very similar units that are impossible to organise. The maps are too small, the explorer unit is just plain pointless, resource gathering is not what it used to be and the trading posts are annoying to say the least. The main strength of AOE 2 was that it was open to multiple different types of play, from rushers, to stay at home economy builders, but in AOE 3 you have one set way to play and if you don't do it you lose.Overall, although not quite as much of a let down as Championship Manager 5, I'd strongly advise you steer well clear of this.
1	Great small space BBQ!: This grill is great for small spaces. We live in a condo in NYC and it is perfect for the tiny area we get to call our "patio". We love to grill and this gives us delicious dinners without taking up cruical square footage. Very even heat, easy, user-friendly design. I highly suggest it!
1	Long term winner!: I have just sold my Patio Caddy after10 YEARS! I worked famously during that entire time and it still works as good as it did when it was new. The electronic ignition never failed to work. And CharBroil still sells them. Does that tell you something? We only sold it because we wanted a larger unit, no other reason. Get one - you won't be sorry.
1	Can't live without it!: I've owned the same Patio Caddie for over10 years now! It grills beautifully over clay briquettes, giving that great smoke flavor and does it all on a fraction of the propane. The key to getting lots of heat from a tiny burner is cooking COVERED. I even bought a kit to retrofit the burner plate and made the old grill like new again for $20!It's a small grill, but will cook six large steaks all at once.
1	IGBY- the european version: The soundtrack album is actualy a european version where the music in the movie is slightly different. It's an excellent compilation including Travis`version of "the weight" and europe's most recent rock breakout "underwater circus"! Higly recommendable.
1	Windows 98 Annoyances: This is the first "Tech manual" that I have read from cover to cover. It is jammed packed with helpful hints and fixes for Windows 98. Whenever the people at work have a question about Windows 98 we delve into Windows 98 Annoyances and lo-and-behold there is the answer. I have also recommended it to the ZDU SmartPlanet Class I am currently enrolled in. Windows 98 Installation and Support Part I. This book is a must for the beginner and even the intermediate Windows user.
0	The Dutiful Rake: Harriet Klausner summarized the plot so I won't do that here, but her 5-star review is way off. I will say this novel had such a nice beginning. A spirited and independent heroine, and a masculine but not overly domineering hero who was attracted to the heroine without really wanting to be. Well, all that burnt out real quick, and the heroine somehow became timid, and easily led into stupid situations, while the hero became thick-headed and unreasonable.I don't like novels where it's obvious that just a simple conversation between the two main characters will clear the air and resolve their differences -- and they never have that conversation until the last five pages of the book. (Sigh.) This is not a horribly bad story, and it's not badly written, but I got more and more annoyed with the plot and with the characters as I read on. I just think Ms. Rolls is capable of much better storytelling than this.
1	Good Choice of Episodes: I would love to see this whole series on DVD, but was happy to get just this small amount on one DVD. I watched some Welcome Back Kotter episodes as a kid and even now, as an adult, I think they are just hysterical. Great fun for a small amount of money!
1	Flour: The flour was good, but because of the weight (50 lbs) they could have done a better job in taping the box shut. The box was banged up a bit, only one strip of tape was used.
1	House version of Prince: Jamie is one of the best house artist short of Larry Heard,Joe Smooth ( Joe Welborn )lil louis,Farly,and all the other house artist out of Chicago. This album should have gotten more air play but the company didn't promote it like they should have.I wish he would make another one.
1	very good debut: This is a very relaxed but also danceable soul album. Jamie has a wonderful smooth voice. He is accompanied by Kym Sims and Chantay Savage on this album. It's a very good and smooth album
0	Bad Mug: I got this and loved the ergonomics. Great feel, size and balance. I was bitterly disappointed that after one cycle in the dishwasher, the top malfunctioned. The mug has a twisting/locking sealing mechanism and the heat from the dishwasher must have expanded it. Now it will not pour at all. Please note, this was not a 'special cycle' or high temp wash, just normal dishwasher and the thing is ruined. I also ruined a pair of pants yesterday when I couldn't figure out why I could not sip and them coffee came running out the side.My only saving grace is that I figured this out before I went and bought more. BAD PRODUCT DO NOT BUY
1	Rare and curious relic: Spade Cooley was not your typical B Western "hero". The cowboy movies where he played the lead character seemed like a parody or even a satirical commentary (intentionally or not) on B singing cowboys of that period. This Alpha DVD contains two of his rare three movies where he played lead. Alpha obtained somewhat passable to good copies of prints and released these in DVD. Despite all, Cooley can sing and his western songs have the bounce that Autry's or Rogers' do not have. Unlike the two, Cooley's personal life took a tumble later in his carrer when he was convicted of killing his wife. You'd never expect it from the soft spoken cowboy hero you see on the screen.
0	Spade digs a hole: This video is for B Western buffs only. Spade Cooley, who was a great fiddle player and band leader, produced some of his own pictures including these. They make B Westerns look like the production values of Gone With The Wind. However, he was one of the very few B Western stars that filled his movies with humor. They are comedies with Spade as the butt of the joke. He looks a bit like a shorter wider Roy Rogers, but unfortunately that's where any semblance to acting ends. I had fun watching these and remembering my childhood, but if you are looking for good B Westerns, pass on this.
0	very disapointed: I realize that this isn't an expensive item by any means, but I guess I expected something more. It didn't give me what I was looking for, which was close-ups of countries, with cities listed. The closer I went in, the fewer pixels there were, making everthing blurry. Maybe I was expecting too much ...
1	***** You want to be MCSE, buy it now with Core In Nutshell: This book is not for the beginner to start learning the product. However, if you are just quite familiar with them, this one is the best summarized book. You will find out that there are many things you don't really know, then you go back to try, you will know. Tell you in more detail, I chose TCP/IP and Proxy as my electives. TCP/IP is okay, but Proxy is not that easy, after you read the book, you should try the server again. Anyway, I have to say loudly that I can pass MCSE in 2 weeks because of this ELEPHANT book and its companion Core In Nutshell. Don't forget to buy both of them, Core in Nutshell and Elective in Nutshell. GOOD BOOK DOES NOT NEEDED TO BE THICK. If it's possible, could the writer write MCSD in Nutshell, please?
1	great introduction and reveiw of topics: At this point I have only read the TCP/IP and IIS 4.0 sections, but I found them very helpful giving a good general overview of the topics. I then used CBT courseware for more detailed information. A couple of hours before a taking a test I also reveiwed by reading through the specific test section. The section in TCP/IP on subnet masking was the best explanation I have ever read, with instruction for creating and understanding the subnetting chart fantastic, making it easy to create and then answer subnetting questions accurately on the tcp/ip test. The book does not get five stars, because it can only supplement other study material.
1	blast from the past: Uncertain at first but just wanted see how it went. For those who know the Grand Canyon must be fascinating. I would think it a must-have for those exploring this area.
1	Hey: Hey, Its Zane Grey,what can you say. No matter how much alike they are,Zane Grey always produces interesting reading. Lots of lessons to be learned.
1	20 minutes to warm up your day!: This is a great warm-up or a mini work out!Breathwork is a focus throughout, while upper and lower body are being worked at the same time, bringing balance to mind, body, and spirit.Whenever I am not feelng motivated I can pop in Zen Yoga Daily Warm-Up DVD, move along with Aaron's instruction, and I am ready to go!
0	Great Initially, major fail after time passes...: We first got this grill 3 years ago (may08). At the time the legs were stable the cooking temp could reach 500-600 without difficulty. By the next summer the legs started getting weak. The liner under the lid needed constant cleaning and most importantly the temp would barely break 450. Then last summer came along and the grill just refused to get hot. I took apart the heating element and was aghast at what I saw. The entire encasement was one big blob of plastic. The whole thing was melted to pieces. You would think the designers wouldn't use plastic so close to the heat! I will not buy a replacement part or buy a new grill until I hear that charbroil has addressed these issues.
0	2010 Char-Broil Bust!!!: Had this grill for three years. It worked great until summer 2009. Thermostat burned and melted where it connects to broiler element. Char-broil customer service gladly sold me a new one - total with shipping $60.00. First time I plugged it in - which was 2 months after I received it - it melted and burned just like the first. Char-broil customer service wanted to sell me another since their parts only have a 30 day warranty. As a one time good deal customer service sent me a replacement with free return shipping of the newly burned out controller. This replacement of the replacement burned and melted just as the other two had done. However, now Char-broil won't return phone calls and ignores my emails. No response to three emails and three phone calls. Don't buy this Char-broil electric grill. It was a good product two years ago but the 2009 and later components are defective and cheap. Find a different brand. I am going to Weber grills.
0	Electric is nice, but some major problems: I've had two of these grills. The first I replaced because it was starting to rust (despite being covered) -- I had no major problems with that one, the second I've only had for six months. The second grill has melted around the heating element, which seems to be a fire hazard. I was quite suprised.In addition, the thermostats on these grills have gotten worse than with the original model -- it seems at least100 degrees off. The fire safety, not including the briquettes and a jacked up price should probably make one look for other options, if only there were other quality options.
0	Does not sear steaks: This grill will work only as a baker and not as a hot grill that will sear steaks. It preheats after 30 minutes to about 375 degrees and the temperature drops significantly when meat is added. This is certainly not the temperature published in the manual. It is not satisfactory for my needs.
1	the best grill that i own: I own three bbq grills .A propane grillcharcol grill and the electric patio caddie.The patio caddie which I use on my deck has forced the other two grills into storage.The electric grill heats up to about 700 degrees in15 to 20 minutes and cooks burgers in10 minutes franks in 8 minutes and chicken in about18 minutes.It is easy to assemble and use.It is by far the best piece of hardware that I have ever bbq'ed on.ps. I intend to use this grill throughout the winter for tailgate parties at home.
0	Total Waste Of My Money: When new, this grill did not get hot enough to sear the juices into the meat, which is what a good grill will do. Also, there was very little smoke flavor imparted to the meat. It was like grilling in the kitchen stove.The heating element failed after one season, so I invested in a new controller. The new unit worked once, and then failed completely. I have had cheaper electric grills that worked much better and lasted much longer.I do not recommend.
0	DON'T BUY: I've had this grill for a little over a year. I paid $189 for it. It worked like a champ for ONE SUMMER, now the controller is bad. Char-Broil tells me that it'll cost $90 to replace. Although I like the features of an elctric grill, fast heat and all, if you make such a CRAPPY unit that it doesn't last long and you don't stand behind it...I say I'll NEVER buy another Char Broil product again!
0	lousy design...: I am now on my 3rd Char-Broil patio caddie! They've each lasted 2 years and then the plastic control knob melts! What kind of design do they have? Then again, I guess I need to stop ordering the grill, thinking they've improved the design. WHY would any engineer place a PLASTIC KNOB anywhere near 400-500 degree metal???? WHY??? I like the look of the new stainless steel version, but WILL NOT buy another until they design a control knob that won't melt!!! PLASTIC on HOT metal???? C'mon Char-Broil....get with the program and TEST your own grills!Don't buy if you're expecting this grill to last more than a couple of seasons.Also, a HINGED LID would be a real bonus, too!
0	Awkward start: Ocean Colour Scene are absolutely brilliant. It is amazing to me that they are virtually unknown here in the States. They write, sing and play beautifully. They are always well produced but never over produced. This however is unlike anything else they have released. It is an awkward beginning at best. The songs show promise and that promise was realized in their subsequent releases. Where the performances are solid, the production sinks the recording. It is dated, slick and just a poor fit for the band's sound. If you must have them all, you will end up buying this. Otherwise, get any of the other releases they are far superior and all terrific. This is just not an essential recording.
1	Great compressor!: This is a great compressor, it has pently of power to drive brads and finish nails.
1	Great music performed extraordinarily well: My introducation to the music of Dmitri Kabalewsky was through the old Horowitz recordings of the 3rd sonata (both live and studio version) and some of the preludes. The music here is not as phantasmagoric as Scriabin, not as lush as Rachmaninov, and certainly not as "modern" as Prokofiev. Yet Kabalewsky is very original and falls within the Romantic range of Russian pianism. His music evokes various moods that might remind one of Prokofiev but there also seems to be an element of the fantasy there as well, especially in the preludes. The Sonatas are tight pieces well worth frequent performances on today's concert stage. The pianist, Wolfram Schmitt-Leonardy, is excellent with this music and plays it to the hilt. The sound and recording quality is very good as well. In all, a worth while CD for pianophiles looking for something new and good.
1	Hot stuff -- an inspiration for writers!: This is an excellent book about a man who knows who he is, dreams of what he might be, and works his butt off to make the near-impossible real.It's a great book for struggling writers to read because Larry Brown came from nowhere to become one of the great writers of his generation and he did it on the strength of his will alone.There are passages in this book so lovely they make you catch your breath.
0	Disappointing: This author in no Dennis Smith. I had expected that a majority of the book would involve the author's professional life and his experiences. What I got was a tiresome narrative mainly about his personal life. Who really cares that he had a deer in his gunsight, thinking "This is the most beautiful thing I have ever seen.", before he kills it. Or all the time he spends drinking beer. There's more but I prefer to just forget the whole regretable experience.
1	Reading ON FIRE not a waste of time: ON FIRE is not a book about firefighting; it is a book about a man's life who also happens to be a firefighter. Brown is a regular guy who worked hard to become a writer, not because he didn't want to be a firefighter, but because he thought he could do something else to contribute to others, doing work as a writer.I think the book is very good. I do not think the book is great. I think the book is worth reading, but I also think if you want to learn more about firefighting there are probably better books out there. Still, I think the book was not a waste of time, as some other reviewers thought it was.
1	Landscape of the Heart: WINTER PASSING is visually beautiful with skillful acting and slow-paced story telling. The lives portrayed are barren as a winter landscape, rife with drug and alcohol abuse, casual sex, self-injury, suicide attempted and suicide succeeded...in their attempts to block out lonliness and disappointment.These lives are groping towards meaning and find it in the search for a redefinition of family, after Reese's rocky homecoming leads to a measure of reunion and reconciliation.The ending is a bit too neat after the messiness we've been privy to. But, the film is worth watching and considering for it's complex interactions among the four characters in the Michigan scenes as they search for some new way, any way, out of a hard winter's landscape.--Janet Grace Riehl, author Sightlines: A Poet's Diary
1	Uplifting and Inspirational!: I purchased the CD as a means of introduction for our kids to christian music. The worship songs are upbeat and spiritually uplifting. Its a fantastic CD and I recommended it highly. It would make a great addition to your current musical collection and an even better gift to a friend. I love it!
1	SIRIUS - SIGNAL KIT: I had problems with indoor receptions with Sirius boom box external antenna so I bought this. It works very well so now I have excellent reception indoors. I installed it with the splitter for standard Satellite not HD and it works well this way I don't know how well it would affect HD reception for the TV if at all. I am very pleased with this unit.
1	This is the best book in the world: Mr. Poppers Penguin is the best book. The author is Richard and Florence Atwater. This is a Newbery Honor book. It is great for all ages because it is the funniest book in the world. My favorite part is when the penguins live in the freezer. The characters are Mr. Popper, Mrs. Popper, Admiral Drake, Mr. Greenbaum, Mr. Klein, Janie Popper and Bill Popper. The Penguins are Caption Cook, Greta, Columbus, Victoria, Nelson, Jenny, Magellan, Scott, Isabella, Ferdinand and Louisa. Hope you read this book.
1	Wonderful Book: I took a University class were The Story of Judaism, third,augmented edtion, by Bernard J. Bamberger was used as the textbook. The book was well orginized, enjoyable to read, and very comprehensive. It added a large amount of historical facts to my religous knowledge. It was well recieved by both the Jewish and non-Jewish students.
1	What can I say?: This was a GREAT find. First bought the vinyl back in the 80's and snagged the disc quite some time ago. Ray signed the cover in 2002 @ the Rock & Roll Hall Of Fame in Cleveland, Ohio
1	Sturdy grater: This product took a while coming, but it is completely satisfactory. Heavier than most drum graters, it offers the possibility of a longer life.
0	When in trouble, break glass: First off, if you are going to write this genre, then recognize that there are people out there who know weapons, know the law and know unarmed combat. This books fails in all of those details.It is not that it is poorly written, but we have your basic corrupt republican administartion interested in buying bullets and expanding the "evil" military. They want to keep a terrible secret from getting loose.Then there is a cold blooded assassin, who starts out good, but makes dumb mistake after dumb mistake.There is the idealistic jornalist that starts running for her life around page 200.And the billionaire bad guys and biillionaire good guys. I'm sure this novel appealed to the New York publishing establishment's world view--does the word cliche mean anything?Finally, when we have a chance for an interesting ending, the author pulls a rabbit out of the hat to make everything better.This plot was terribly predictable.
0	Disappointing: I read a lot of thrillers, and this debut by Casey Moreton disappointed me. As a previous reviewer pointed out, there is very little in this plot that is original or suspenseful. It is instead consists of elements recycled from a lot of previous thrillers -- a corrupt President, a reformed hit-man, a father looking for his lost daughter, etc.The most problematic aspect of this book is the lack of a central character. The author keeps jumping around from person to person, changing narrative perspectives. I therefore had no idea who the "hero" of this novel was supposed to be. To me, it's hard to write a good suspense novel unless you have a sympathetic central character, and there really isn't one in this novel.If you like suspense novels, I recommend reading Harlan Coben or CJ Box instead.
1	BEST CD I BOUGHT ALL YEAR!: The review that prompted me to buy this CD called it "an embarassment of riches" and it is an understatement.Every song is a joy. During the first listen I waited eagerly when the changer switched to the next tune. You never know what is going to greet you next. Big band, salsa, gorgeous ballads. They are all here. With a voice that can be soft and beguiling one minute and powerhouse the next, I was completed shocked that I'd never heard of this singer. The arrangements are so rich you'd expect to hear these musicians backing Streisand or Eder. And the extra surprise of getting a duet with Susan Egan (I'm a big fan), with both of them belting out their gospel best. Why has this woman not yet been on Broadway?This was my first listen to Lisa Richard, and I will go back now and buy every recording she has ever made.
0	worth product i never got from Amazon website before: i ordered this book on june14, i didn't get the item till amonth later. The shipping suck. finally, i got the book after my school already start, it was too late for my class. It's totally bad quality differ from what the seller detail. Bad Service, bad product. never buy anything from the seller again.
1	perfect: Perfect on my Sony blu-ray, 4 year old daughter enjoys it, probably just buy it considering the price to rent it...
1	Lauras Review!! GO ME: well...I havent seen this movie in a while but its one of my favourite movies of all time...Its great! The songs are amazing, the graphics are remarkable and the whole movie is perfection. Tim Burton is a Genious!! I love this movie...I had it when i was little and I watched it all the time...Thats why I want the DVD
1	Classic Tim Burton: What can I say, but BRAVO! A stop-motion picture of this calibur will NEVER be topped. Definitely an inventive way of visualizing holidays. Tim Burtons visions artistically come to life in this dark christmas tale. Great Job!
1	Nightmare before Christmas: Tim Burton does it again! I don't know why it is listed as a Christmas movie, I would think more of a Halloween movie, could be both I suppose. Awesome!!!
1	My favorite movie: This is a great movie with incredible stop motion animation. The story is fantastic, my kids love it, they watch it all the time
0	nightmare before christmas: Let me start by saying it took over 5 weeks to deliver, upon delivery my Granddaughter was extremly overjoyed. Until i tried to play the dvd, come to find out the movie will not play in the U.S.A. Not only is my Granddaughter upset i am realy pissed, This purchase was a waste of money and time.
1	Very Happy with purchase.: The item was the same as what it was described as. Great value for the money with the Special Edition!
1	Twisted, different, fun: Tim Burton's worldview isn't quite like anyone else's, but that's what makes "Nightmare Before Christmas" such a treat. Jack Skellington, the Pumpkin King, is tired of Halloween. He kidnaps Santa, thinking he can do a better job and ends up creating the halloweeniest Christmas ever. Some sensitive kids and adults may be disturbed by the imagery and the fun Burton pokes at the holiday. Definitely for more mature children only.
1	Great movie great condition: Movie arrived before estimated day and is in great shape for being used. Will use this company for my dvd needs in the future.
1	A charming Mexican Romantic Comedy: Anyone who has any familarity with Mexican culture will immediately identify with this movie. The son who does his mother's bidding no matter what. The young woman who marries to escape the constrictions of the family. The closeted nature of gay life in Mexico. The mother who works to make sure her son is happy as well as presents the proper appearance in society. Someone from the United States might wonder what all the fuss is about. But the movie touches on the Mexican world view and gay people in a compassionate manner for the time. A good training manual for any gringo who decides to involve himself with a Mexican male.
0	Terrible product quality and service: Ordered a 2 pack, only received a single pillow...which upon being filled the first time, found it leaked terribly. Best I could get was a1/2 refund for the one that never arrived since the leaking pillow was "used". So much for consumer protection and refunds for defective products. Do not buy ANYTHING from this company, especially this product, unless you want to lose your money. You'd have better odds at Vegas getting your money back.
1	So far, happy: The only flaw is that it is HEAVY and cold on the bottom. Otherwise, I seem to be sleeping pretty well with it. No leaking problems as others stated.
0	Imac Crap: This book is useless. Anyone with10 minutes may sit at an Apple computer and learn more hands on than the hour or two wasted reading this book. The other reviews here re: iMac Fast and Easy are very misleading... probably written by someone with interests other than yours.
0	Yuck!: a spaghetti western at its worst. Mistook the film for the new Django and what a mistake it was. Thankfully, it was only a rental. Never bothered beyond the first ten minutes.
0	A Mess: I have read this book cover to cover (with my highlighter and pencil at the ready) and I've never been more frustrated in all my life. I work with Word everyday and am looking to automate documents and I can make no sense out of any of it. (Of course, there is a strong possibility that I'm stupid and in over my head - but if you think you're going to learn to create templates and fill-in forms and learn to use If-then-else fields, etc., well, I missed it.)
0	It was alright...: While listening to Sleepy Brown's album, I was amped to hear some smooth groves and soul. I was pondering on whether I would buy it while I bobbed my head to the music video for "Margarita" because I liked that song a lot. But while I listened to the album, I noticed that it remained even throughout. There was never a bad song or a really great song. It was at a steady pace the entire time, sort of like listening to Sade or someone of that nature. When "Underwater Love" came on, I was pleasantly surprised that he did have one head bobber that made me want to dance, but other than that, the album was at a medium pace. I don't love it. I don't hate it. I'm just indifferent about it. I would replay "Underwater Love" in heavy rotation, but I'm not sure I'll buy it.
0	didn't work for me: used about 3 of these over a two year period, although in partly shaded places, and never caught any YJs. The reusable rescue trap(which I guess i am having trouble finding in stores now) worked fairly well. I did use water as per instructions, however. did not try the apple juice thing.Guess people don't find this review helpful, that is OK. There might be regional differences or other poorly understood factors. Just my experience with the product. The YJ problem is so bad around our property(especially after mild winter) got stung several times this year and personally destroyed 2 underground nests, yet they are still around. Have heard they can forage for a quarter of a mile away. We live in one of the Gulf Coast states and maybe that is a factor. Maybe our YJs are smarter than the ones in other places, who knows. I have to try this again but will use apple juice mixture this time.
0	Terrible: How did this product even get1 good review? Terrible, sat right next to a whole swarm practically that was coming to my pool to drink water every day. After 7 days, it caught NOTHING. Took it down and tossed in the trash. DO NOT BUY THIS, you will be disappointed.
0	Don't catch Yellow Jackets: Their old attractant caught TONS of yellow jackets so I am experienced with this trap. The white attractant has not caught anything except a few flies and crickets. The company is great however and has agreed to work with me if I continue to be dis-satisfied. I am giving it one more try and using apple juice this time instead of water.
1	Always works: I am big fan of Irwin Naturals Ginkgo and been using it for years. My wife uses a lot of there brands as well.
0	Not a good everyday supplement: I rated this item one star since I had bad experience with taking it and withdrawal effects.The Ginko part is great, but it has L-Dopa which is precursor to dopamine , a major neurotransmitter in the brain. taking this supplement regularly will make you sleepy and if you stop it suddenly will cause depression symptoms.Please read more about the supplements content before buying any.
0	ugh!: The plot is corny and unrealistic. The characters couldn't be more transparent if they were glass. Definitely a waste of time...unless you want to get a few good laughs at the author's unintentionally humorous style.
0	no: I didn't like this book because it was as true to life as advertised on the back of the book. I think agent Night's character should learn to talk like a real person.
1	Lust for Danger blew me away!: I was thrilled with this book! My only regret was that it ended. Fast-paced, exciting, human characters...visual...great dialogue, exotic and well researched locations...I can't say enough! I hope there are more Agent Night adventures in store for us. It was so refreshing to read Lust for Danger, definitely brought my appetite back for a good story!
1	Top notch movie: Have enjoyed this movie for years. Don`t know why I had not bought it before.The Sweeny Todd performance is the greatest.Sure beats "Memories" from Cats.
0	Pretty Lame: I thought this movie was pretty bad. It was SO easy to predict. Liv Tyler's role was so small, I think she is a lovely actress, who made a bad choice to work in such a cheesy movie.Ben Affleck may be fabulous eye candy, but I must say, his acting abilities are lacking substance.Overall, I would skip this one all together. Even as a rental.
0	Good story idea, but carried out in a bad way: The basic idea of this story is good: a father learning how to raise his daughter while also trying to cope with the loss of his wife and the fact that his daughter's birth caused his wife's death. What could have been great was botched, however. There was too much profanity. I find it in very bad taste to use profanity in front of children. I also found there to be too much sex in the movie. They could have developed the plot without that. I did like the Will Smith side jokes in there, however.
0	Garbage: Poor acting all around, Horrible storyline. Do yourself a favor and pass this one up. You'll thank me.
1	I don't care I enjoyed this movie!: Being a father and also being a Kevin SMith fan, this movie was easy to connect with, I also have a daughter and a big ambition to make movies, it is also something that gets in the way of being a dad. A great movie.
1	Extra Questions for the Test!: This series contains a quick review of each exam objective and a large array of questions per objective.The questions are relatively similar to those on the test and will at least give you an idea of where you need to brush up.I would reccomend this book along with any of the Coriolis or Syngress MCSE series.
1	I'm learning a lot!!: I really didn't even use the cd's for two weeks, just the book and it's been marvelous. My boyfriend is Hispanic and I felt the need to be able to at least recognize a few words of Spanish. Once I started to use the cd's everything came so quickly. Como se dice FANTASTIC in espanol!!!!
0	This is a waste of money: This CD set was a complete letdown. [...] the CD case is cheap. You open it, and the CDs fall out. The CDs are clearly just made in a CD burner.What's worse is the content. You will NOT learn Spanish through this program. I studied Spanish in college, and I know this is nowhere near a complete course. It doesn't bother teaching the past tense! You learn just the present tense and a tiny, tiny bit of the future tense.The Spanish speaker is excellent, I must say, but the English speaker [...]will put you to sleep. He reads like a robot: "O...K...Luis....now...we...will...dis...cuss...the ..numbers...in...span...ish." BORING! Nothing is tied together--it's just a bunch of random commentary thrown out at you.I'm sure there are much better courses available.
0	[aweful]: This is probably the most ill-formed book in general I have ever read, not to mention the worst grow book, period. The illustrations are CHEESY.The photographs are of poor quality, you can barely discern them. The information is general, contradictory, unorganized... I wouln't trust a thing in it, which is strange because Jorge Cervantes is a genius, and his previous publications prove his skill. But this book is a no-no. Go for another, and don't be afraid to spend the bucks. You want climate matched with plant variety with specific feeding instructions, and plenty of do's and dont's. If your info is poor then your fruit will suffer.
1	Nice, well built darts: I got these after my less than stellar experience with the Viper Black Mariah's. These throw better, feel better and are built much better. Overall it was a wiser investment for a casual dart player like myself.
0	Dreadful: Bought this item based on the positive reviews. I bought 3 and followed the directions. Not only did this trap not catch any flies, the smell was dreadful. At first we thought we had a dead mouse in the wall. The smell is that bad. We threw them out. This trap was a waste of money and time.
0	Works well, but the smell is intolerable: I put one in the garage and another by the trash cans. Over1 weeks they both collected about 20 flies each, but the smell was so bad I had to remove them from any where around the house, I now have them in the back of the yard where they continue to work, but the flys are still getting in the house... too bad!
1	These are great fly traps!: THis is the second order of these fly traps. We tried a locally available fly trap after the first order was completely full of flies but the other brand just didn't do the job so we reordered these to use in our horse barn. These are WONDERFUL. Within minutes of hanging them, the flies started collecting. We hang them just over head level at each of the entrances to the barn and the arena and they do a superb job of ridding the barn of pesky flys that annoy our stallions.
1	Highly Recommend: This fly trap really works well. I hung the fly trap in our cherry blossom tree which is located close to our trash cans and our huge pigeon cage. This time of year the Cherry Blossom tree is dropping cherries and with the high temp heat, they almost splatter when they hit the ground...the flies love this...plus we have a dog. So needless to say we have flies everywhere and I hate them. The flytrap has been hanging for two weeks and there are hundreds of flies in this thing. Especially during the hot afternoon it is swarming with flies, I have noticed a significant difference in the number of flies. They used to be all over the grass, all over the trash cans, The fly trap has made a big difference. Don't get me wrong we still have flies...but not like before. Every couple of days you have to make sure to check your trap to see if you need to add water to it, so the water stays at the fill line. I ended up buying this flytrap at Lowes.
0	Either I've attracted Highly Evolved Flies, or this is100% Rubbish: Are there a lot of flies near this? Yes.Have practically any flies been caught by this stupifyingly piece of useless rubbish? No.Review complete.
0	SAVE YOUR MONEY!!: We had a cook out in our back yard and we hung this up on the deck about 5 feet away from the table and not one fly went for this thing as they were all in our food!! As soon as we cleared the food from the table, then they went for this trap so this did not work for the intentions that I bought it for, which was so the flies to stay away from our food!
1	Fly control: This thing is amazing, I got one after seeing it in action at a friends house. WARNING Be sure not to spill any of the contents what so ever, mine fell off the tree I had it up in and months later I still smell the bait in that area and it smells like death.
1	The one that Works: I purchased this product last Fall on a close out sale at a huge national retailer. It worked perfectly. This year I returned to the same retailer in July and they had sold out of the Rescue Brand Fly Traps and didn't plan on restocking until next year. They talked me into purchasing another brand. Needless to say the other brand didn't work. We live next to a cattle pasture and the flies are outrageous near our home. I hung the "other" brand fly trap on the fence between the pasture and my driveway and a week later there were a few flies in the trap. I ordered the Rescue Brand Fly Trap from Amazon and hung 3 of them on the same fence. 3 days later I had to replace the Rescue Brand TrapsRESCUE! FTD-DT12 Disposable Fly Trapbecause they were FULL OF FLIES. I will not use another brand trap because I am not a wealthy person and cannot waste money. The Rescue brand Fly is the one that works. Don't waste your time or money with any other brand.
0	First 3 songs good then...a little disapoointing: When I head "Shining Light" I thought this was going to be real find. When I bought this CD, I was let down a little. The first things (including Shining Light) are very catchy and good. But, from then on, the CD just goes into gradual mediocrity. Oh well, I guess I still think Shining Light is a great song with great words.
0	OUTRAGEOUS price!: Why are they so expensive here? At least twice the price that they normally are at a drugstore! I love Amazon, but it drives me crazy when they jack the price up on random items. I thought I was supposed to get a the best price here.
1	One of the best entertainment book: I have read many, many books on Hollywood and auto/biographies in general and this book ranks as one of the best ever. It is a very entertaining book that doubles as a great history of Hollywood through its golden age. Capra interacted with Hollywood's legends and reports in a funny, candid and emotional way his dealings with the likes of Harry Cohn, Sinatra, Disney, Monroe and many more stars of the thirties and forties. Do not think the book is dated: yes, some of the names are meaningless to us today but the perspetive and lessons contained in every single page are timeless. this book tells you better than any others how movies are made or should be made...
1	ONE OF THE FUNNIEST MOVIES OF THE 90'S!: THIS IS BY FAR MIKE MYER'S BEST MOVIE! DANA CARVEY AND MYERS LIGHT UP THE SCREEN LIKE NO OTHER COUPLE. THE SCRIPT IS BRILLIANT FUNNY AND COMPLETELY ADDICTIVE. WHAT DO I MEAN? AFTER YOU SEE THIS FILM YOU PICK UP LINES LIKE EXSQUEEZE ME? AND BAKING POWDER? GET IT? ANYWAY, GREAT MOVIE AND GREAT CULT-LIKE SCRIPT! MYERS IS A TRUELY GREAT COMIC. BUY THIS MOVIE, YOU DEFINITELY WON'T REGRET IT!
1	Squeeze me? Baking Powder?: If you grew up watching Mike Myers on SNL, you'll appreciate this movie. Not great but funny enough to make you chuckle.
1	AGE3: I have been a fan of this series from the beginning and it has only gotten better with time and later versions. The latest version takes place in a time period with great significance and has always drawn me in. The graphics are great, as long as your computer is equipped to handle them. I started playing on an older computer which locked up during ship battles and such. However, with a newer comp I enjoy full game play. Maybe there were some bugs in the software initially, but I have never had a problem outside of processor speed. Great game, 5 stars.
0	There's no commentary, I expected more.: I wanted to know more about what John has to say. But, there's no commentary, only fill in the comments yourself. I can do that with my bible. A good buy but, not what I expected.
1	An apt title for retro-loving film buffs: This is a great collection of Burlesque shorts. The "features" are not entirely worth watching. Every element of the classic grindhouse atmosphere is recorded--the gritty backdrops, the corny comics, the jaded stripteasers, and even some hilarious musicians having trouble keeping their eyes on the instruments!Even if you aren't planning on watching every short in this two-disc set, it is a great purchase anyways. I have even used this as a sort of conversation piece/ambiance in some interesting parties. The interview of Lili St. Cyr in the liner is also well worth reading.Enjoy the lost art form of Burlesque!!!
0	B at best: I did not make it very far through this movie. Even if you think Jenny is attractive (she's not) then you still shouldn't watch this movie. Thankfully amazon prime gives it to us for free.
0	Dreadfully Unfunny: This was a movie recommended to me by a friend. I turned it off after seeing a fish imbedded in the lower orifice of one of Jenny's dates. He yells, "Touch my bass!" over and over. Need I say more? OK, how about the earlier scene where another of Jenny's dates throws up on her breasts? One of the worst movies of the decade.
1	if u have an off beat sense of humor you'll love it!: In this movie jenny mccarthy stars as rebecca who is dating a typical model who is more in love with himself then her. This movie is not for people who find typical things funny. Everything from her break down on the hollywood strip to finding her boyfriend cheating on her are things that women encounter. I mean the whole part where she goes richard my richard and then starts to cry and then stops calms herself then thinks about the situation again. classic. ive done that although not on the street. and when she walks in on her boyfriend and doesnt say anything my friend did the same thing. everyone has that white ghetto friend. everyone has that ditsy friend. all the stereotypes were done to the extreme and thats what makes it so great and really funny. you cant take this movie seriously and you shouldnt try to. Just enjoy it!
0	terrible: Why did I waste my time watching this movie? It was on the first page of popular picks. It was beyond bad.
0	Aren't there any negative stars?: This was a total waste of time. Bad acting, worse plot, the most intelligent part is the screams of OMG. Not worth the money that you don't pay for it.
0	pure cra*: This is the first movie review I have ever provided and I write it only to save any other person out there a bit of your life. Skip this movie, it is the worst I've seen in my life.
1	Do yourself a favor.... BUY IT!!!!!: I'm owned this cd since it came out and all I can hear is Dave Tregunna kick ass basslines, Andy McCoy's atomic guitar and some major adrenalin ricocheting of off some drummer I never even heard of until I brought this cd.... THE BASSLINES KICKASS ON THIS ALBUM!!!! Dave is a very underated bassist who not only plays very creative basslines but is also able to sing some great backups as well and I needn't say anything about Andy his playin speaks for itself. Billy's voice is fine. So what he doesn't tend to take one direction when he sings. I happen to like that about him. There isn't a bad song on this album. DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND BUY THIS CD!
0	worth a rent, but that's it: I was looking forward to seeing this movie after the write ups I had read about it. I must admit I was highly disappointed. The acting was good, but it was such a cliche storyline. Repressive husband, wife gets tired of it and starts to look for more. I guess I just didn't think it original. I didn't care for the lines or the chemistry between the cast.
0	Poor anti-war movie: I am trying to decide if I am going to throw this DVD away. I watched the whole movie. It was the toughest sit through since "Mosquito Coast" with Harrison Ford. I do not mind watching a movie that is making the case that war is bad...war is bad, even though sometimes it is necessary. However, the movie itself jumped all over the place. As another review said, the relationships were poorly built. At first the animated portions of the film were interesting in an artsy way, but they kept coming back and were over used. The battle/war itself should have been more focused upon. The Crimean War was badly fought and this could have been a much better movie if it had shown the poor quality of generalship on both sides instead of just showing the character of the British and French generals.
1	Pretty Good: I have the Night Before Halloween so I decided to give this book a try. It starts off very good. It fell off to me toward the middle. But, overall still a very funny and entertaining book.
1	Children loved it!: We heard about this book and bought it for our grandchildren, they loved it but so did the adults. It is a funny book!
1	Cute: I like how this book is realistic yet kid friendly. My 3 yr old can relate to almost every page and it teaches him a few new words like "needles" on the tree and "sugar plum" to which he always calls out it's candy! And he laughs when the baby pee pees on Santa. He also likes when the girl says "bad kitty" because our pets are always knocking down ornaments, too. It is almost creepy how close this comes to depicting our family, my husband even came down with the flu, too. Would recommend this for an evening read-aloud with the kids because it is cute for parents too.
1	Loved it: Interesting period piece. Well written... this manuscript won an international competition by Wallace publishing (Chicago) as well as a $10,000 prize for it's author, Jeffrey DePrend (Oscar Prendergast) in1919.
0	bad experience: I thought i was getting a dvd i could view in the USA!Unfortunately it was for viewing in China!I was told i would have to pay for shipping to send it back,wow. This was from MovieMars,beware
1	Excellent Read: I have read this book at least 2 times in the past few months - it is an easy, but very good read that explores lots of concepts and practical steps. Chapter 3 definitely rocks!
1	First Buy: At least this on played on my dvd unlike S2. Really enjoy this series so glad I purchased the series so I can watch it whenever I want to.
0	Build Your Own Pentium III PC: As with most of the "build your own" books on the market, this one is pretty out of date. Also, the book supplies you with very little information which would help you select which components will best meet your needs and which components work best together (ie- which motherboards, video graphics boards ...). Basically this book just explains in very breif detail how the system all works together.The most difficult thing in building your own system IMHO is deciding which components will best meet your needs and will work well together. I did not get any helpful info from this book along these lines. In fact the author does not even seem particularly knowledgeable about the subject matter in the book. I think I could have wrote a better book and I do not even consider myself a computer geek.Bottom line, I waisted my money...
0	Not really that great.: Bought this and "Sterling NFT-D Disposable Fly Control TrapWith Attractant"After a week this Jar had about 50 flies in it.The other, had hundreds.Only downside to the bag working so great is its pretty much already full after 2 weeks and I need a new one.Might just dish out the money for a bug zapper.
0	Not as effective as had hoped... and it REEKS!!!!!: We leave a bowl of food out for our outdoor cats, and it attracts a LOT of flies... this fly trap has helped somewhat, but the results are minimal. The odor from the trap is absolutely horrific and unbearable. If you don't have a bowl of pet food sitting outside, perhaps this trap will work for you (and definitely place it where you won't smell it!).
0	do not buy: Green top does not hold the weight of the water well.Hung mine and yes the lid was on tight.Next thing it fell from green top and was all on the floor.Green plastic top does not hold weight of water at all.
1	Underrated blues/rock band compels musicianship to new level: Much in the spirit of Zeppelin, the Badlands take their smart rock and outline a detailed map of musicianship that easily makes todays Limp Bizkit compost creations, a musty meddle of distasteful whiner garbage. When it's said that this CD is hard to find, there is a duel meaning. Finding a copy to own for yourself may be quite a challenge, but more importantly, a CD of this calibur is hard to find in a world where it's cool to regurgitate already virulent ideas. This CD is more than enough to make the group's cover of James Taylor's "Fire and Rain" a rock n' roll classic.
1	HILARIOUS: IF YOU LIKE PHYSICAL HUMOR AND STEVE CARRELL, THIS IS A WINNER. ANNE HATHAWAY IS GREAT AND ALTHOUGH THIS ISN'T LIKE THE ORIGINAL SERIES, IT DELIVERS THE LAUGHS. MY TEEN SONS ALSO THOUGHT IT WAS FUNNY
0	DIGTAL COPY WILL NOT WORK: A warning that the Digital Copy disc that comes with this Blu-Ray set will no longer work. It "expired" in December 2009 and can no longer be accessed. Just something that should be noted, I think, for anyone buying this Blu-Ray new today.Having purchased it for my son to watch, and wanting to put it on his iPod to do so, was very disappointed that this wasn't known prior to purchase.
1	Funnier than expected: I was pleasantly surprised while watching this movie. The inclusion of The Rock helped decrease the overall dorkie-ness. Lots of fun and right up there with the Austin Powers movies.The Blu-Ray copy looked AMAZING. I did not see a copy of the regular DVD version so I have no real comparison but that aside, it looked crystal clear.
0	Ha-Ha, boy, was this funny?: The main problem with this movie: it was'nt that funny. I think I laughed once, maybe twice. Normally, Steve Carell is very funny; but he had nothing to work with here. Terence Stamp, a great actor, is totally wasted in this punishing film as the main villian, Siegfried. Anne Hathaway was completely forgettable as, er, I forget. And someone please tell Alan Arkin to stop sleeping on the set...oh, he was awake? Could of fooled me..One laugh was generated by Bill Murray, playing Agent13. Besides that, I can't think of much else that made me laugh. This was a comedy? Good points: Nice crisp,clear picture and this was a free rental.
1	Can't be beat: I don't usually like these kinds of movies. I am more of a Disney fan, but for some reason this one really tripped my trigger. I love how it is relatively clean, and has a fun balance between action, adventure and silliness. I pull it out whenever I need a good laugh.
0	taking stupid to a new hight: this movie makes the orignal max smart a genius. did not even make it half way through the movie before having too stop watching due to way too much stupidityIf it wern't for Anne Hathaway (t.n.a.) and the Rock. Now I like goofy movies, but this went a little past that point. RENT FIRST before buying. who knows, maybe it will be better the second or third time I try watching this movie
0	Stupid: How this movie is getting such good ratings is beyond me.It just goes to show that people will like anything these days.People are such simpletons that I guess doesn't take much to amuse them.This movie is so stupid and no I am not comparing it to the tv show,I never even watched it.This movie was not funny nor did it have a good plot.Maybe I don't get Steve Carrel's humor,I don't know but I'm not gonna waste my time writing a long review for this horrid movie.I think they should stop making tv shows into movies.(Miami Vice,Land Of The Lost)It seems that it doesn't work.
0	Plain old Boring!: I remember GET SMART with fondness and loved watching it with my dad in the 60's-early 70's, so I guess I was expecting too much from this film and I actually left the theater about 40 mins. in. It just was not funny. It tried hard with the gadgets, and quips from the TV show, but for me it just didn't connect at all. I'm not being critical, just honest.
1	Delicious!!: I bought this Thai Green Curry paste to cook a Thai dish I'd seen made on of the cooking shows. It turned out PERFECT. I almost make that dish weekly now. Can't live without my Mae Ploy!
1	Spicey: This is real potent. It doesn't take a lot to make it firey. This tub should last a long time
0	A waste of talent: This movie has an all star cast but is so horrid. It is so funny to watch how horrible the movie is. Do not buy it, please save your money and buy shaft! This movie is so corny it is like you woke up in a comedy of Goodfellas.
1	WOwzeRs: I'm not usually a rock music person. I saw these guys on the shelf at a music store. so when i got home i downloaded one of the songs. I fell in love. I had to buy it. and so, of course, I did. The vocals on this album are amazing. His voice is so smooth! Well, you HAVE to buy this cd. I am telling you now, you wont be disappointed. My favorites are "Addicted" and "One Day", but i love them all too. So what are you waiting for!? click the BUY button, get ur credit card and.. and yah, from there do whatever u want..
0	Grow some balls, PLEASE!!!: This group is so WEAK I could puke! I am from the Montreal area like these guys, I am really truly embarassed by this band. Their material (I can't use words like art or songs because they don't apply) is so cookie cutter, radio pop, middle of the road friendly BS that I would not waste my time downloading it for free. message to the band: Grow up, I'm sure your all over 21... you have to admit it looks pretty stupid when a full grown adult sounds like an angry13 year old trying to impress a girl or piss off "mean old dad", but I guess good money can make anyone do anything eh guys?There is some really good music out there these days people, AIM HIGHER! avoid this sh*t and go find it.
0	"I think they lost their balls": This whiny pop punk ass bull sucks! If you listen to it, stick your extremeities into a blender. NOW.
0	Why are they compared to Good Charlotte?: They can't hold a candle to Good Charlotte. GC actually has some good guitar parts and SOLOS (yes you heard me). SP has none of that. They play slow power chords with sappy lyrics that are copied off of Blink and GC but are not sung with nearly as much emotion. At least Good Charlotte's lyrics are different, this bands lyrics aren't, its all boring love songs that we've heard a billion frickin times... I gave them 2 stars because I like a few songs but thats all. And you know what, all you people need to stop b****ing over whats "punk" and whats "poser". Good Charlotte have said themselves their not trying to be punk, so whats the use in arguing?
0	Punk? yeah right: Little preppy kids, this is NOT punk, this is pure pop with guitars. I can't stand this group, they sound like all the other pop bands out there like bad charlotte, sum 41, and blink182. There is no orginality here, all the songs sound the same. these guys are as punk as NSTYNC. If you want to listen to real punk rock get a Dead kennedys, rancid, bad religon or sex pistols cd!
1	Best CD Around: When I got this CD I don't know what I expected, but when I listened to it, I was like WOAH! THIS IS FABULOUS! I really reccommend it to EVERYONE! It has something for all. :P
1	Rick: I think all of the people who think Simple Plans album sucks can lick my balls because there is not one song that is not good on the Cd. I think simple plan did a great job making the album and everyone who thiks it sucks can lick my ballsack
0	THIS IS COOL: oh my god I love this band, they are so hot. I love they're punkish hairstyles and the way they dress. The music is awsome. IT's like the coolest cd I own besides Britney spears and good charlotte. The lyrics are like so deep, I almost cry. I'm a teenager too and I know how it feels when your parents yell at you and when you break up with your boyfriend and stuff.Damn my nail broke. Gotta go, American Idol is on. Simple Plan rocks!
0	STay away from all pop/punk at all costs!: Now i decided to review this rancid cd, i mean green day cd, o wait is it blink182? no wait its good charlotte o no its simple plan its all the same though,lol Punk= pop end of story its all the same you want to hear some meaningful music go pick up KoRn's self tituled debut and you can hear Jonathan davis (vocals for KoRn) crying in the background or go buy marilyn manson's antichrist superstar and go listen to the man that you fear now thats real and its not fake! Another person reviewing this garbage said the lyrics were sad?!?!? sad?!??! no pathetic heres pretty much what you get when you listen to this crap o no i wrecked my daddys car boo hoo o no god hates me he lieks to pick on me and i wish i was dead cause lifes to terrible thats bull*hit!!!! but its another band for the preppy popular kids. so sad it really is. It really is.
1	Yeah, yeah, yeah.....: Hey, moron.... it's "I'M SORRY, i can't be perfect" not "daddy, i can't be perfect".... Nothing else to say, just doing my part in trying to educate the losers of the world.
1	Simple Plan Rocks: If youre into bands like Good Charlotte, Green Day, or Blink182 then you should definitely get Simple Plan's album. Especialy if you like Blink and Good Charlotte, since some of those guys guest star in this album. Addicted,My Alien, and God Must Hate Me are just a few of the great songs on this album. If you love new punk music then you need to get this album.
0	Man, this actually sells?????: Now let me tell you right now that i DO like pop-punk(The starting line, Midtown, greenday, Fall out boy). But this is just garbage!!!What qualifies for music these days is just horrible. These guys have NO punk essense whatever. they are just pop. just cause you dye or spike your hair, wear a studden belt and skate shoes deos not make you a punk. these guys target demographic is11-13 year old girls who think thier life sux cuase a guy deosnt like them. They are just a boy band with guitars. This is as manufactured as mainstream pop garbage.
0	I wrote a poem on this band: Simple PlanYou say your punkThat is bull $h!tYou sang "I Don't Want To Think About You"Those Lyrics Connected To Me Cause That Is How I Feel About YouAll Who ANswer No To If This Review Is HelpfulCan Lick My....HandIf You Like ThemThen You Go To School Wearing Abercrombie and Spend Hundreds of Dollars Say Your Punk and The Only Ones That Agree With You Are Your Immature Poser FriendsSnoogans!Love,The JonesIf you agree your kick@$$!
0	REALLY BAD...: it's completelly embarassing the posture of the guys from simple plan....they must be 30 years old men, but sings naive lyrics with a complete lack of talent and the songs seems the same...TERRIBLE!!Almost everything on earth is better than this silly product.
1	Simple Plan Rocks: I was never into punk rock before I heard Simple Plan. Now I'm an all out punk rocker. Their album is incredible and basically tells the story of my life. I like it because I can relate to almost all of their songs and their sound is great. Not to mention their lead singer, Pierre, is so hot! I can't wait for them to come out with a new album. Everyone should own "No Pads, No Helmets... Just Balls"
0	badd: hprrible punk emo sellouts, try to sound like a band that deserves credit ANBERLIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0	THIS is What is Wrong with Music of Today: I don't have much to say but bands like this have no originality. I'm sick and tired of hearing pop punk emo whining bands that all copy off of each other doing the same old crap and making albums complaining about girls and whatever else. I'll admit, I haven't listened to this whole album, but just from the singles and clips I can tell exactly how this is. Come on people! Music is about new sounds and originality, these are the same chords and whiny lyrics we've all heard far too many times. Don't support this trash.
0	Well..: Well, I have listened to parts of this album, it's not very good. I just wanted to review because I wanted to be cool and bash a band like the "punk" fans on here. I want to fit in too :(
0	Sucks: See my review of their live cd.And god, go easy on the caps lock, you poser punk band loving psycho.
0	No balls... no helmets... just pads!: Maxi pads that is! I saw a poster of these posers, and they tried to rip off the Casualties. In this Casualties poster I have, the band is standing all pissed off in a junk yard, in the Simple Rip-Off, they stood tryin to look cool in an abandoned lot(i bet they had security to protect their rich boy asses!) I hate posers, and i am tired of rippin off the Casualties and other true punk bands.0 stars please!!!
0	*yawn*: It's obvious that Simple Plan is primarily aiming for the younger teens with this. At least I hope they are. The lead singer is not very good, and his voice may grate on your nerves. People bash Avril because they say she is a poser. Avril's never said she's putting out punk music. These guys believe they're punk....they aren't. Still, if you like sugar-coated, trl/radio friendly pop...with the tiniest breath of punk in it, then by all means, you can't go wrong here. If you want real punk rock, go with AFI. I would also like to urge you to check out KILL HANNAH, a little known band whose cd is coming out sometime next month.
0	Killing Rock and Roll: Many analogies fly, comparing Simple Plan to actual musicians. Bands like this, although obviously imitating better bands like Green Day, shouldn't be mentioned in the same sentence let alone "compared". Every time the music making department at Atlantic releases something like this, they may sell oodles of records, but they kill music a little more. I agree with that other guy. Go buy Nevermind. Music is an art, not a product. But that's just my opinion.
0	no pads, no helmets........just [bad]!: (i am actually14 yrs old)My friend has this cd, and I asked her if I could borrow it. Worst thing I ever did. The singer is really whiney. I could see why he was an unpopular person...
0	I HATE WANNABES!!!!!: i absulootly h@ wanabes they make me sick! ppl think their punk if they buy th@ sh*t from hottopic and listen to simple plan and other sh*t! it's the same evrywhere, they listen 2 avril lavigne and call themselvs sk8er bois, or they dress in black and call themselvs gothic! labels r 4 soup cans, and only some1 w/out a personality would just follow the crowd and buy whats popular! i also h8 whiners and preps, there r so many people whining about how terrible their life is and so on, we don't need to hear a grown man whining about their life, and pretending 2 b teenagers! hotopic just supports all those people buying th@ cheesy sh*t, so while im complaning about simple plan and all th@ sh*t might as well tell the world what i think about hotopic!!!
0	And this cd is the worst one ever: You know it's a sad day for punk rock when12 year old preppy girls flock to the NFG simple plan concerts. Why does punk rock suck so bad now? This cd is the epitomy of [bad] punk rock. If you want to listen to good punk/emo go buy Les Savy Fav ...
1	Another pop-punk band: Simple Plan is anothe pop-punk band. This CD is pretty kick ass. They've given the guys a hard time with the IMMATURE stuff but they're trying crits! I got the record as a present and I really liked it although I wasn't planning to buy it. The guys are growin up and I'm sure critics are gonna shut up on their next album.Simple Plan is simple...if your a teenager and y u?re trying to write up a song then you?d probably come up with something like one of SP?s songs. The bonus (Grow Up) and hidden (Christmas) tracks are really good and probably they?re the songs you could relate to the most.I would really reccommend this album to anyone who likes GC, NFG or something like that.
0	Ugggghhhhh...: The same rehashed Pop/Punk thats been used over and over again. Flavor of the week guaranteed. Let them have their moment in the sun. Let the little kiddies call themselves "punk". Let them have a taste of the rock star life style, but in a year they will be forgotten. This is what happened to Blink182, and Sum 41 was really big for a while, but they're losing it already. Now, it's New Found Glory(who are starting to lose it), Good Charlotte, and this unholy drivel known as Simple Plan. This pop/punk thing will be over... give it a year or two. THERE IS STILL HOPE FOR GOOD MUSIC!
1	Simple Plan Rules Canadian acts: I love Simple Plan adn i love this new album! all of the songs are really fun and easy to sing along with. It's constantly in my CD player and i take it with me every where. The boys are so talented at their insturments and I love Pierre's voice! This CD is definitly one to buy!
1	Sad lyrics with happy music... oddly nice.: Almost every single one of SP's songs are terribly depressing.It's obvious that lead singer Pierre has some issues with his family. The utterly depressing, tearjerking 'Perfect' is one of the saddest songs I've ever heard. But the rest of the CD blares out happy-go-lucky guitar riffs, juvenile lyrics, and just plain fun. I've had the pleasure of meeting these talented guys, and that is really what they're all about. This is a great easy listening CD - it may not be earth-shaking or momentous, but it is just good clean fun. Favorites include 'My Alien', which is just a funny song about a rather odd girlfriend, 'God Must Hate Me', which I'm sure is something we all can relate to (luckily He doesn't!), and 'I'd Do Anything'. Pierre's vocals go nicely with the whiney pop-punk music of Seb, David, Jeff, and Chuck. These guys are great - see them in concert, they're even better.
1	Such a GREAT CD!! I love it!: I really love this CD! It is more "poppish-punk" rather than true punk rock, but so good. The lyrics themselves are mostly about the pains of growing up and are sometimes on the down-side. However, musically this CD is so uplifting and is energy-packed. The songs are fun and the lyrics relatable for anyone who has ever been a teenager or 20-something, like me! They are a great band and the lead singer's voice is really unique. I love them because they are not only fun to listen to, but can actually sing. The best songs are toward the beginning of the CD, but really it's all good! For anyone who likes Good Charlotte, Avril, 3 Doors Down, Linkin Park, or Michelle Branch - or even if you don't; buy this CD.
0	Worst...band...ever: Every time I hear simple plan it makes me want to vomit. They have to be the worst band ever. Their songs are stupid and sound just like every other pop-punk band. Not original at all. Overall this album is a -100,000. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS GARBAGE!
0	Garbage at it's finest: This album is the prime example of what really bad pop is capable of. Now, I'm not bashing Simple Plan because it's Pop. There is some catchy pop that I don't mind. And I'm not gonna bash 'em for trying to be punk, though they are not, and if you think they are, you know NOTHING.Let's just focus on the music:Lyrics: Whiny, sappy12-year old stories of hating the world. Tried and done. Some bands do it. This band doesn't, and it sounds terrible.Singing: The lead singers voice is absolutely horrifying. It's unbelievable he's the lead singer.Guitars: Ok, they can play some basic rhythms. Yay. No creative parts whatsoever.Drums: The only aspect of the band I won't belittle or raise. But needless to say, nothing special.I won't even mention how awful their image is. I focused on the basics;Simple Plan Simple ... , God does hate them, and they are Kids, forever.Don't waste your time on this garbage.
1	love it accept for one thing: Great value for the price..... very comfortable and easy to use. The one thing I find which causes some discomfort is the foot cushioning mechanism. Being that you are actually hanging by your feet in full vertical, I feel the cushioning should have been designed in such a way in order to prevent any possibility of pain..... I do experience pain in the back of my ankles once hanging for over a minute, or after doing crunches. I'm 5'5" tall and weight112 lbs., so it is not due to excessive weight. Otherwise the product is a great deal.
1	ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh, finally!: When my table arrived, I couldn't wait for my husband to get home to assemble it. Turned out I didn't have to, it went together without a hitch. From the first use, I could feel a release of pressure in my spine that I hadn't felt in years. I took one star off since no matter how I adjust the height and foot rest, I still have to reach up and pull myself up (if I didn't slip this wouldn't happen). I wear boots so I slip less and can relax my feet, which also reduces the discomfort. I'm happy to deal with a little pressure on my feet in order to experience the euphoric release of pressure on my back, finally! It's amazing how your mood changes when the pain goes away...
0	inversion table: junk you get what you pay for. you better make sure someone is with you even if youve been on one before. im 5ft. 7 and i have to set it at over 6ft. to be able to get back up.that probably wouldnt be so bad but now you are not lined up with the back so its very uncomfortable. its a wonder they havnt been sued yet. also the ankle braces are cheesy and uncomfortable. im sorry i tried to go cheap. i was better off going to sports authority for 200. i got a reebock that i can return much more easily if i dont like it. im going to try and give no stars as its not worth1 star but i already put it in and i dont know if i can change it.
1	Worth every minute I spent on it: Get the facts straight from the source. The author is convinced that MS SQL is the best thing since sliced bread and that fact alone makes you want to keep reading. His positive and professional attitude puts the reader in the right mood to absorb and learn. He's not the "neutral observer" kind of author usually encountered (he's a member of the development team).Simply put, this book has the most actually useful, less known information about MS SQL I've ever seen (I've read more than 6 books on the subject). No "idiot-proof" hand holding, no useless screen shots. This book assumes you HAVE used a computer before and that you ARE a computer professional. Every suggestion given in the book is accompanied by the logic behind it as opposed to "change this setting to this value because I say so".Soukup is now on my list of "must-read" authors. Thanks Ron.
0	Works as a webcam but not as a digital camera: It's a cute little thing, but who wants to pay $25 for a cute little keychain bobble? Put in a AAA battery, start it up, take one photo, and the battery is dead. But it doesn't tell you the battery is dead, so you keep taking pictures, but they don't get saved. When you go to download the photos, you find you've only got the first one. At the cost of one AAA battery per photo, this has got to be one of the most expensive digital cameras on the market.Works ok as a webcam, but because its not really designed for that, you have to hold it in your hand to use it, so it's more or less useless for that application too.Save your money!
1	Love Chick Corea and Flora Purim Together: I used to listen to What Game Shall We Play Today back in1977. I never knew the name of the song or the amazing singer with the latin accent. After hearing the song in my head for over thirty years, I managed to locate it on Amazon a few weeks ago (wonderful benefits of modern technology). I love Flora Purim's voice, and the lyrics are beautiful. I am not a huge jazz fan, but I listen to this song over and over.
1	o.k. terrific: it's absolutely happening here. the gangmembers will probably be the evildoers' new police force
1	Amazing!: I too worked for Wolff New Media writing the NetBooks. Michael Wolff struck me as one of those fairly arrogant, not-much-time-for-the-little-guy entrepreneurs. I always assumed he was just like the many suits who were always coming through the office. It never crossed my mind that he was having his own private war with these guys, the investors or venture capitalists or whoever they were. His book is not only a total eye-opener but it's an amazing piece of writing. I read it one sitting. I can't believe that all this was going on around me and that I had no idea. I guess this book is like Barbarians at the Gate or Liar's Poker, but it's different too. It's real writing. It's great writing. You're in Wolff's head--a place I never imagined I'd be or want to be. But damn if it isn't one of the funniest places I've ever been.
0	Only read if want to read everything available on net biz: This is not a good book. If you want to read everything about net businesses, then go ahead, but I learned about as much on IPOs in the net world from a10-minute Business Week article on eloan, and most of the stuff about predicting where the net is going is his thinking from a few years ago and is outdated. The book jumped around a lot, and it is hard to stay interested.
1	~ The Best of the Star Trek movies~: The long awaited movie of the Star Trek crew did not disappoint. This is the best of the Star Trek movies in my opinion. Gene Roddenberry thought so too. Thrilling scenes of the Enterprise coming out of dry dock. This director's cut adds some superb effects that don't stray from the original film intent. The storyline is pure and in keeping with TOS (The Original Series) the humor is there but not campy and over the top like some of the following Star Trek movies. Highly recommend .
0	Must have for Trek colletors, otherwise...: Not much to be said about this film, use it for a sleep aid replacement. This or 2001:A Space Oddesy.The film is made longer, but not much so, (Even more BORING!)The Special Features are excellent, and much more exciting than the movie
0	Not a good start for the films: Someone, possibly the writer Harlan Ellison, possibly Steve my butcher, once called this The Motionless Picture. He was right. Terrible idea, terrible pacing, terrific special effects, and no fun watching Kirk and crew reunite. I can remember being about13 when this movie came out, actually dozing off in the movie theater. Stick with Star Trek 2, 4, 6 and 8. All the even ones.
1	Excellent...the VI Bible: I have used this book at my workplace for some time, and it is an excellent book. A must for any serious VI users. Now I am actually buying it so that I can quickly grab it for reference, instead of running down the hall to grab your friends copy.
1	Great non toxic product to reduce fly populations: Rescue FTA Fly Trap Attractant works great. Using new attractant in the reusable bottle is much more economical than the disposable traps. While there is a little odor close to the bottle, it can be used safely around pets where you wouldn't want to use poisonous sprays and powders. And it really works!
1	Arctic Dreams- a long read but worth it: Barry Lopez's Arctic Dreams may be a long read but it is worth it. Sometimes the language is a little over the top, and the authors personal ideas are interjected a little too much for my liking but the essence of the text and the beautiful scenes that are set up give a new perspective and really make the read worth it. This is a book I had a hard time putting down and picking it up again with ease, sometimes I would have to go back a few pages to remember what I read before so I could continue. This book really gave me new insight and a different way of thinking about the frozen tundra I really don't know a whole lot about, and made me appreciate its beauty in a new way and understand the importance of the landscape.
1	Great History Reading: I read this book for a college history course. It is a great book to read if you are interested in understanding the effects of world war Ii on different people. If you are not open to New ideas about history, then this isn't your book. If you are open to the fact that an epic event such as world war II can have a tremendous impact on people from all different aspects of the US, then this is your book. Thanks Studs.
1	Great book: I received this book as a gift, and subsequently purchased for a friend. The advice is practical, and the book isn't preachy. My15mo old routinely uses10 basic signs (milk, eat, pain, sleep, etc.), and I think our lives are much better for it. Instead of crying or shouting, she can ask for what she wants. I can't compare to other books, because I haven't read any, but sign language has been a very positive thing for our family, and we were successful using the advice in this book.
0	Poor Product: First time i used this mop, it left a lot of water on the floor and the mop head fell off. The instructions do not tell you how to get it back on. I expected more from a Mr. Clean product. Very disappointing. I have emailed Mr. Clean with zero reply's!
1	This Book is Truly An Eye Opener: I would recommend this book for All to read. It has truly changed my life for the better. I wanted to be closer to God and this book helped me connect with the higher power on a deeper level. This book has given me my faith back and has transformed my thinking and i am grateful that Dr. Stanley wrote this great book for those of us that are looking for answers to so many of life's questions. If you don't already have this book please get it. You will not be disappointed. I have a new way of looking at life and a new relationship with my creator.
1	A Fresh Look...: This book was wonderful. It gave new and practical insight into how we can truly hear from God. Stanley captures scriptural doctrine into every day practices that every Christian can and should implement.
0	Regretful: So I happen to love queer spec fic. I have a fondness for spooky movies that feature gay characters. But The Sacrifice is no Hellbent.The acting in this movie is atrocious. I never once believe that their was more than a passing attraction between the leads. Their interaction was so stilted and the kiss one of the most tepid I have suffered to watch.This is obviously an amateur production and it shows in the casting, the writing, and the scenery. The very ending was convenient and made little sense as the great powers the lead was supposed to possess never played a major role.I recommend avoiding this one. For a more sultry movie, try a DeCoteau - they may not be truly gay, but at least the quality is immensely better.
1	A Horror Treat for the Spooky season: A must see film for the Halloween season! Behind the autumn beauty of a small New England town lurks the decay and evil of a Satanic cult. Behind the lanky frame of a Gay Goth lies the power of a witch. Behind the mundane world of humdrum life there are ghosts, murders, and tales of illicit lust. In his first film, James Fessenden has woven classic chilling elements to create a terror tapestry of cold-hearted malice. Things are seldom what they seem, and there is no room for security in a world that only seems to be tranquil and quiet. As an independent film, it should be judged by its sinister spirit and not by the production values. This is a film that deserves to be watched on a cold autumn night when the wind rattles the house and creaking boards add to the atmosphere. See it with someone you want to freak out!
0	Disorganized, incomplete, and unfriendly: The book has lots of information but one has to go through lots to loops to get to where the information should be and then it may not be there.E.g., the index has no mention of the 'wm' command--one that I often encounter.E.g., another book implies that there is a canvas command 'delete all'. After I finally got to page 61, I found the 'delete' command but NOT any hint that one can use the 'all' command to delete all the objects on the canvas.Another example, even though the book purports to cover TK--the visual side of the language--I find just one chart, .Needless to say, there are very few examples.
1	TCL/TK in A Nutshell: "TCL/TK in A Nutshell" is an excellent reference book with comprehensive detail. It's not for novices, though. Newcomers to the language should be advised to start with something suited for dummies, and from there to search the Internet for specific explanations and examples.
1	everything went as expected: Product arrived on time and in perfect condition. I would recommend this supplier again. I will most likely order again.Thanks
1	Roses: I love romance novels that are clean, This was a very sweet book and fit into this category! After reading it I downloaded all the books by the author, Margaret Widdemer, free! I've not read any of the other ones yet.
1	Album Good For a Stupid Movie: I love this album. Don't scare me none is a good honest song. The movie is one of the worst I've ever seen. It's the reason JM hasn't done anything in the movies since.
0	Does not work buy something else: I purchased 3 traps and this was one of the three. Out of the three different traps this has caught one and I say one yellowjack in a week. The others have had to be emptied at least once...you do the math.
0	Does not work as effectivly as advertised: Our yard was infested with Yellow jackets. After installing 6 of these with the better separately sold attractant we watched yellow-jackets fly around these traps for days without having any more then 3 or 4 actually enter the trap. After the full 3 month term of the attractant we used the trap maybe captured 30 to 40 bees out of what we perceived as hundreds flying around.
0	Rescue My Wallet: Useless, a total waste of money. The wasps laughed at it. Did attract some flies however. So not totally useless.
1	The Gladiator: I first saw this movie when it came out fifteen or twenty years ago and got it on video. I have been trying to get it on DVD for years, but it is not available in Australia. Thanks to Amazon I can watch it again and again.
1	legends at work: listening to roy hargrove and karl denson play is as exciting as joe henderson/lee morgon or miles an trane. nuff said
0	anyone see what i did with this cd? caint find mine...: ...AND IM HAPPY ABOUT IT!i think i might cry if'n it shows up again. fareals.if albums where 3 dimensional this wouldn e'en make the c-side!i love me some roy, but bruh hurt me with this one.i forgive him tho, cause he done gave me much much pleasure up til now... ...um, hope that came out right.*pimp struts off stage/pounds chest with gorilla fist/machismo free flowing*m'out yall, peace!
0	Great movie; horrible DVD: The movie is great but if you're buying it to own a high-quality, pristine copy to watch over and over again, you'll be disappointed.The DVD image is covered with white specks, dust, and long hairs. They appear every second or two and are very noticeable even at full-speed. I would expect a VHS tape to have better image quality than this.In addition, I couldn't get the "special features" menu to work on two of my DVD players (although one of my friends has no problem). This continued even after I exchanged the disc for a new one.If you absolutely must own this movie on DVD, then you have no other choice. But for the others, I would warn that this disc does not nearly match the quality of the other 95% of...discs available.
1	Over120 Inspirational Recipes: Presented by a renowned Thai restaurateur, Thai In Minutes: Over120 Inspirational Recipes is a cookbook packed with swift and easy-to-prepare Thai dishes. Most have a total preparation and cooking time of about15 minutes or less. Notes on Thai culture round out the simple instructions, full-color photographs and explanations of traditional ingredients. A must have for connoisseurs of Thai food who are short on cooking time, Thai in Minutes includes such mouth-watering delicacies as Vegetable Wontons, Pork with Garlic and Peppercorns, Mango Sorbet and much more.
0	Quality of DVD stincks: I love the original series but feel cheeted. There were episodes that I remember that were not included. Mostly though the quality control in these DVD's is realy bad. My father owns a set, and he returned several sets before he got one that is mostly good. My set was good all the way through until the last disc. I have not returned it for fear that I'll get an even worse set.One of the things they did that I hate is they recorded on both sides of each disc, so if you get a bad one, a lot of episodes are potentially messed up.
1	where's Cy??: I wouldn't call this a complete set. Does anyone remember the episode where Starbuck and the cylon are stranded on a planet, and the cylon(Cy) gives his live for Starbuck? A wonderful episode, yet it seems to have vanished!!!
1	Im buying this set!!!!!: Battlestar Galactica is my favorite all time show!Frack!I know alot of people are saying bad things about Galactica.Its All talk and it sounds like some of ya are just jealous!Battlestar Galactica has everything! Awesome music its better than star wars!Great special effects the vipers are so cool!Beautiful cast{Sheba shes nice and pretty,Athena a goddes,Cassiopeia so lovely and with Starbucks sarcasim it goes good with Apollos calm and cool attitude.Boomer is cool too!My favorite episodes is Saga of a star world,war of the gods,the hand of god,the living legend,Baltars escape,the long patrol and murder on the rising star!See ya!
0	Terrible: Possibly one of the worst television shows ever created, this series totally destroys any quality its amazing premise had with horrible plotting and dialogue, and acting that was even worse. Rightfully cancelled mid-way into its second (even worse) season, "Galactica" somehow found its own little niche audience.Like any other series created by Glen Larson, it has a great premise, but can't get anything else right. The characters are poorly drawn, swaggering fools, and the Cylons are even worse. They're slow-moving, dullards of machines. It's a wonder even the foolish crew of the Galactica and its rag-tag fleet were able to defeat them so readily EVERY TIME they go into combat.Avoid this set, unless you're REALLY into watching bad TV and movies. This belongs on the same shelf with movies starring the likes of Steven Seagal and Freddie Prinze Jr.
0	Ohhh, Jilly, Jilly, Jilly: I await each Jilly Cooper book with great excitement. I love the pure escapism of her too good/too bad to be true characters. I love her witty turn of phrase. It takes a lot to get me to laugh out loud and she has accomplished it before. . .not this time however. I actually forgot, several times, I was reading this book--it was boring, the characters annoying and the premise unoriginal. I strongly recommend you not waste your time--go back and review Rupert/Billy the early days.
0	To be avoided: If you are a begginer looking for information on growing MJ or a more experienced grower requiring ideas then you will do very well to avoid this book. The material is poorly laid out, is often confusing as it is littered with spelling mistakes and seems to have been done in a slap dash manner [...] lots of ideas and details on hydroponic cultivation are very dated and would seem to date back to the late1970's.[...]
0	Disappointed: I bought this set to have some extra sockets around the house. I was hopeful this would be a great product, but unfortunately, it's not. The whole set isn't very good in quality and I figure they would probably break if you used them very heavily. I just threw the set in the garage in case every other socket I have disappears, I at least have this set as a backup.
0	TERRIBLE!: Well our friends in CHINA have turned out another CHEAP CHEAP product! Sockets fall off the ratchet and extension with the slighest movement. Socket walls are so thin I am sure they would split with the lighest load! Bought this to carry around in the trunk of my car...I should have known better! Avoid this one! Amazon refunded my money right away and did not want the set returned.
0	DISAPPOINTING: Looked good out of the box. However, upon first use, the yellow handled driver broke. The plastic handle cracked while trying to loosen a nut. Then, the1/4 inch adapter broke while using the ratchet inside the13mm socket.Not a durable set of hardware to say the least.
0	You get what you pay for: For the money, this is not a bad deal. Yet I found it to be of inferior quality. The ratchet looks like die cast metal even though it is "triple chrome plated." It is rough around the edges and is not like an evenly polished higher quality tool set you see at other stores. The driver handle is cheap plastic that reminds me of a similar one I had that split and broke from the shaft. For a flea market type set that does the job, I guess this is what you would be looking for.
0	worth it for the price: the ratchet is too weak. not even able take off one nut before it broke. need to shop for another one now.
0	Cheapest build quality I have ever seen in my life: I know this is only10 bucks and I was certainly expecting cheap and cheerful. But this beats all standards of a poorly made product. The blow molded case is a disaster - nothing fits in its place. The ratchet is the cheapest I have ever seen and the sockets themselves are very poorly finished. Comes with duplicate sockets - one each for quarter inch and 3/8 inch I believe. A simple 3/8 to1/4 adapter would have sufficed, but that's an entirely separate design issue. I would never buy this again, even for the low price.
0	For display only: I decided to buy this because I needed to do an oil change on my car. After two minutes of using it the wrench it got stuck and never worked again. You can actually tell it is bad quality just by turning it by hand. I wouldn't recommend this item to anyone (not even for a small job). The item is on its way back for a full refund thanks to Amazon great customer service. Lesson learned, whether you use them a lot or not, these tools need to be of good quality so spend the extra couple of dollars and save yourself the hassle.
1	Doesn't make you an expert, but more than enough to pass.: I only gave this book 4 stars because of the numerous typos. Bottom line is, it's an easy read--a much easier read than the Sybex book or the Cisco Press. If your goal is to pass the BSCN, and if you want a book that's straight forward, with the authors not trying to impress you with unnecessary technical mumbo jumbo, then this is your book. With this book, and the study questions from cheet-sheets.com, you're sure to pass. I passed with an 816 only reading this book once, reading two chapters a week. Just remember, you only need 690 to pass. Good luck.
0	Quick Shot?: Thomas M. Thomas and his co-authors did a very poor job this time. When I studied for the BCMSN exam, I was glad to have a copy of the McGraw-Hill book, but this one seems to be nothing but a quick shot, published before the others do. Very rarely, I read a book containing such a huge amount of errors. Fortunately, many of them are such obvious that you have to notice them at once; and not all of them can be presumed to be errata (or at least, they shouldn't be). For example, a multicast address of 2214.0.0.10 (!) was stated, and you will be presented a chaotic mixing of hyphenated and non-hyphenated commands which you will surely be asked to keep apart in the exam.Some chapters as those covering (I'd better say: not covering) EIGRP or BGP are much too short because many topics - as route maps - are almost completely omitted. After all, I would recommend to read the Ciscopress book instead to be sure you get all the information needed.
1	One of my favorite CDs: This CD is full of bouncy, upbeat dance music that is fun to listen to. The accordion playing is wonderful.
1	Dora's reviews: My husband and I watch this movie a lot. It is funny. I had never heard of this movie but I am glad I purchased it. I recommend it to anyone.
0	Disappointed child and mama!: My 20-month old son loves Road Construction Ahead and many other videos that focus on earth-moving equipment and "machines", as he calls them. We purchased this video hoping to add a little variety to his collection but have been disappointed with it. For a young child, perhaps under 3, this video has far too much dialogue, not enough action, and loads of ridiculously unfunny jokes and slap-stick humor that little kids just don't get. My son likes looking at the video box but doesn't enjoy the video at all. Try Road Construction Ahead instead.
1	Remarkable memoir, remarkable woman: Ayako Ishigaki's wonderful fictionalized memoir is revealing for it's sometimes subtle, sometimes angry, and sometimes tender treatment of the both the culture she was born into and the culture she experienced in the U.S. It's also a remarkable historical document that presents views of Japanese women that may startle the reader. The writing is fluid and engaging. You can read it easily in a day or two.
0	NOT the BEST from the BEST: The waffle maker and sandwich maker USED TO work great. (I never had the opportunity to use the pizzelle part.) Everyone in the family, including the kids, hated the BAM! written all over their food but the food came out great. It worked fine for three or four months but then the non-stick coating started to bubble and peel off. And it is supposed to be high-end ALL-CLAD? It ended up being returned with no questions asked...makes me wonder how many others were returned. Hmmm...
0	This has got to be the worst batman movie ever.: Batman Returns is just plain sick at times. The Penguin, who used to be almost loveable in the original comics, is a homicidal nutball in the movie. The catwoman (who is in herself at times very disturbing.) is blond (she is supposed to be raven haired) and more of a pain to watch then anything else. The only redeeming value is the occational funny line from Penguin.
0	.: Tim Burton's worst movie, hands down. It's visually interesting, but that's about all. Batman himself seems like a secondary character in this sequel, and unfortunately I couldn't get into Danny Devito very much. He plays the role well, I suppose, but the story is awfully flimsy and there just isn't much to latch onto here. I will say that Michelle Pfiefer ... oh my ... I had a crush on her for months after seeing this for the first time. And it isn't just the skin-tight leather outfit (although it sure helped.) My. But in any case, watching her was the only redeemable distraction I could find in this disappointingly poor movie.
1	Batman: Returns, Awesome but dosent match "Batman":1992 saw the release of the much anticipating "Batman: Returns" and it really is a mixed feeling movie. Its enjoyable but in the way it dosent match its predessor "Batman" it is very cool how it is all dark and got a creepy vibe and its storyline is OK but it just dosent really meet perfection. Penguin is absolutely disgusting and i really hate him and Catwoman is cool but in other words they are cool villians. Same "SPECIAL" featues as #1. This film is good and I reccomend you to see it but if u have to choose1 out of the 2 "Batman" is the way to go.
1	"Gentlemen, start your screaming!": Danny DeVito makes an execellent Penguine. And Catwoman teams up with the Penguine. Batman (Keaton) fights the two villains and defeats one of them. However, it isn't clear if Catwoman got away or not. One of the better Batman movies.
1	The best Batman!: If you haven't seen it, you must. Michelle Pfiffer is the best catwoman...Halle Berry can't hold a candle to her awesomeness. Micheal Keaton is a great Batman. Definite must see!
0	It;s too Dark: I don't what I disliked about this movie the most. The fact that Gothom City looks like a war zone, or the fact that the story's focus is not on Batman again (even though the movie is called Batman) or that the Penquin is the most repulsive one ever created for film. The first movie had Jack Nicolson in it, this one has nothing.
0	Eeeyew!: This movie is disgusting. None of the characters are the least bit interesting and it seems the sole purpose of Danny Devito's Penguin is to be gross. At least the original Batman movie had some wit and decent music. Don't waste your time with this worthless use of videotape.
1	The best BATMAN ever!!!!!: Tim Burton's direction shines in this picture. It's perfect. "Batman Returns" is dark and mysterious the way it should be. The series needs to return to these dark roots again; take the neon off the batmobile, take the nipples off the batsuit, and please get rid of Alicia Silverstone!!!! (And bring Catwoman back.)
1	Great book: This is a great book, honestly I have using a lot of its know-how on my job.My advise is that all reader should know the decorator pattern to understand better the class structure, and I hope in the next version add some information about it.
0	One man's biography: I didn't know this was going to be a one man biography....had expected more detail of Mississippi and the south over this period of time.
0	Not enjoyable: The reviews here reveal that some people found pleasure in this film. Unfortunately, I do not find myself among them. I could not wait for it to end. I watched the whole thing only because I had paid to rent it, but it was mostly a painful experience.No one is really connected to anyone in this film. Almost all the characters seem narcissistic and flippant. There are so many characters introduced who are carrying zany, personal issues, and we are supposed to care about these. But the reader has no motivation to care, due to the disorganized storyline.The attempt to create a warm reunion of people who care about each other falls short. None of the characters have much heart, and there are even several face-slapping scenes! The only appealing character was the young nerdy woman, who appears briefly. Please, let us have more well-written films with appealing characters.
0	April's Shower: It was okay. The acting wasn't all that great and neither was the story line. I did like how April's mother came around so fast and was more concerned about her daughter being happy rather than who she was with.
1	depends: This is a good book if you just want to read about what grace Slick did outside of Airplane and why she decided to do it. It isnt one of those books which documents every single date of release of album and what happened within the record company and how it was marketed in the nation etc.... Those books are good but to me this is a nice change to very complicated books, and although she does write the book in an informal manner, it makes it better as it sort of seems right to talk about stuff away from the band in the tone she uses. this book is mainly sex, drugs, and a bit of rock and roll. Still very funny and good sense of humour though. Just depends what style of book you are after.
0	A horribly written and edited book about the queen of rock.: Where did Grace find this "writer" to co-author her biography? What could have been a terrific and insightful look at one of rock and roll's greatest and most rebellious icons instead reads like entries from a diary. Poorly sequenced and unimagitively written, this book suffers from an obviously inexperienced co-author who has a pre-occupation with Slick's sexual trysts and demonstrates little interest in nor knowledge of her music-making. She should stick to writing romance novels. I'll remember Grace Slick for her electrifying performances and wonderful music, but never this book. Get it from the library and save your money.
0	Disappointing: Considering the life she's led I would have expected more from Slick's autobiography. A big yawn--I skimmed through the last 200 pages.
1	This book had a lovely romantic twist to it!:): I am not a great fan of Mrs. Alcott, but when I began reading this book, I was immeditaly hooked. The plot was so interesting and something happened in each chapter--and whatever happened always had to do with Edith--wheather it was Lady Ida cursing her or Lord Percy admiring her--it always had to do with her. This book had a romantic feel to it, and it wasn't how I would have expected it to be. The romantic part was kept hush-hush amongst the charecters--but the irony of it was everyone knew about it. I really enjoyed this book and I recommend it to anyone who is looking for a new summer book. It's great!
1	Astral Projection at their finest: Astral Projection has been making the greatest trance for years and years. And its great to see that after more than 5 years, they are as good as ever! Although I dont think any track on Another World matched the power of their early classic "Powergen", every single song off this album is amazing. Astral Projection have changed their sound a little bit from their prior "Dancing Galaxy" album, adding some new progressive-sounding synths to their arsenal. Still they keep their own original flavor. This is my favorite album of 99 so far and if you knew anything about true trance music, you would agree!
0	Back Care Yoga A Waste of Money: I was really disappointed by this DVD. My acupuncturist had recommended that I try a Rodney Yee video, but I don't think he knows that this is mostly fluff--there's lots of advertising and talking, but only 20 minutes of actual yoga. So as a yoga session, it's just too short to be of much use except for absolute beginners--but it's clearly not aimed at them, as Rodney uses poses that true beginners would not already know, and does not instruct in how to do them.More important, the yoga exercises are too short. The program is 90% stretching, but the stretches are not held long enough to be effective. The poses are also too brief. And there are not enough of them--real back work involves strengthening back and abdominal core, but there are only a few poses in this program that do that.Based on this DVD, I will not buy anything from this source: it feels like a moneymaker scam to me.
0	Backcare Yoga for Beginners: This product is garbage and Amazon should be ashamed of themselves even allowing it to be sold on line to unsuspecting customers.
1	Terrific purchase: Beautiful Sateen sheet set. Price was great and quality is above average. Will definitely purchase from this merchant for all my bedding needs. Great seller!!!
0	Not much here: I was dissapointed in this little book. It looks like the book was rushed out to capitalize on the war and Rumsfeld media attention. Not much here in terms of learning - Rumsfeld is pretty command and control.
1	Krames Provides a Quality Read on Rumsfeld: I liked the way the book was organized. It distills Rumsfeld into an understandable person with recognizable leadership principles and skills. You can see why he has been successful and even appreciate his no-nonsense approach. A good quick read on a unique individual.
0	Pointless: What a waste of money! She loves the life she didn't expect? Page after pages sounds more like she's praying for a man to come along and save her. Let's all just bide our time until a man comes along. I don't fault her for wanted to get married, but the last thing I wanted to read this weekend were a bunch of short stories about how all her friends are getting married and she isn't. The reality is if she really loved the life she didn't expect she would talk about all the things she has done because she is single. If I had gotten married, I never would know the joy of living on my own, come vacation time I always get to pick where I go next and I love my career. Believe me, there is something to be said for doing what you want, when you want without input from someone else. Sure someday I may get married, but he would have to be a heck of a guy for me to give what I've got. So bottom line, live your life for you, not for someone who may or may not come into your life.
0	disappointing: I was expecting so much more after _Dawn and this book wasa disappointment. I know many people who never bothered toread the last book in the series because this one lefta bad taste in their mouths.The characters just didn't connect, no empathy with them.
1	Love it! Love It! Love It!: Love it! Love It! Love It! "The Pre-Foreclosure Property Investor's Kit" by Thomas Lucier is very informative and a must read for anyone interested in this type of real estate investing. Mr. Lucier tells in detail how to negotiate with homeowners in trouble, how to be the solution to their problem, and how NOT to have the door slammed in your face. He also demystifies the process of dealing with the homeowner's lender by explaining in detail each step in the process of taking the property off their hands. This book, along with Dean Graziosi's [[ ASIN:1593154461 Be A Real Estate Millionaire: Secret Strategies for Lifetime Wealth Today]] have helped me so much in understanding how to be successful with foreclosures.
1	BUY THIS BOOK, Valuable information and web sites.: This is a fabulous book full of very valuable information. Where to find and how look up information on a property.Straight forward no nonsense information.Many websites resources listed in this book that help you research a perspective property.

1	information was easily applied,: This book, was very well organized. easy to understand and apply, I ordered three books and this was the best of all three.
0	Don't waste your money....: Different paperweight, same seller: I ordered 3 of these from this seller. They came defective. Each of the dahlia pictures had flaws/defective markings. It looked like a crease in the picture or a depression made from to much pressure. The quality just wasn't there & I just couldn't give them as gifts as planned. I contacted the seller & shared this with them. They would not provide me with a postage paid return label to send them back & really didn't seem to care that they sent me defective items. There just wasn't customer service offered. I bought it, they have their money & whatever, not their problem. I began researching their reviews & found this was normal for them. I wish I had never made this purchase. I am out even more by having to pay for my own return shipping on these defective paperweights to get a refund & this is money I really don't have to spend. I would never purchase from them again & I hope you don't have the same experience I have had.
1	Just great!: I heard Van Hunt on NPR and immediately ordered the CD. In his interview with Travis Smiley, he mentions that one of his favorite artist is Prince. Mine too!As other reviewers have mention,this is no ordinary artist and an extraordinary CD. Van Hunt is amazingly talent. I can't say what I like more the voice, music or lyrics. It's very hard to categorize his style. The best way to know is to listen to the sample clips.I've played the CD as background music when entertaining guests and have received great reviews. You won't be disappointed.
1	Good book to understand USA for an european: After my own travel through USA I red Steinbekc's book. It has given me the oportunity to understand a lot of your spirit. His openminded vision is one I have not seen so often over your interesting nation
1	One of the Best Travel Books Ever Written: I just finished the book and it was a fantastic read. It was a fairly "light" book, considering the author; it was genuinely hilarious at times, and, as always, Steinbeck created an incredibly vivid, personal, and accurate portrait of the relationships between nature and society. Shades of his earlier can be seen in the prose style, and his unconditional devotion to the creation and development of images and characters can't be matched by anyone from any time.As far as a "Travel-style" novel is concerned, I think I liked this one more than Kerouac's On the Road...but, then again, Steinbeck was far more talented than any of the Beats -except Ginsberg (who might've been in his league, but in a junior-varsity-type capacity) and maybe Neal Cassidy.If you like Steinbeck, you will really enjoy reading this book.
1	Traveling: I liked some of his other works better, but this one is OK. The concept is good but now it is somewhat dated as his trip was in the '60s.
0	This book deserves less than one star: This is the most boring book I have ever read in my entire life, and I have read quite a few books. How Steinbeck could say soooooooo much about soooooooo little makes my head hurt. It is very good if you are an insomniac, though.
0	torture!!: This book is painful to read because you are hosted by a crotchety old man who is annoyed by life and loves no one except his dog. He meets people who he finds boring and visits places that insult him and tells you about all of the lousy things that happen to him and then reminds you of all of the good things that have disappeared about America. If you love Steinbeck don't read this book because perhaps you are meeting the real man and you will feel different about his other beautiful books. If you don't know Steinbeck and want to, try Pastures of Heaven or Cannery Row. Those books are how you want to remember him by, and not by this last, wheezing gasp.
1	As timely now as when released...: This film is a must-see for those who have power over war and peace. Think about it - the peace treaty is about to be torpedoed by high ranking officers of both the Klingon Empire and the Federation, who stand to lose big time if peace ever breaks out.Is there any similarity to the present Israeli-Palestinian conflict? Looks like it... Especially since, every single time there is a chance for peace, some new attack on the part of anyone over there derails whatever progress is made. Almost seems like the rogue Federation and Klingon officers of this film. But I digress...This picture is a huge credit to the filmakers of the Star Trek saga, just when it was most needed (after the disaster that was Star Trek V). If you are interested in serious science fiction, toelrance between cultures or are in the mood for a good thriller, watch this one. If you live in the Middle East, by all means watch this one!
0	Booklet NOT included!!!!!!! Paramount execs are tightwads.: Just when you thought Paramount was coming around and being nice...they find a way to stick it to the ever faithful Star Trek fans who support the franchise and the undeserving pocketbooks of the Paramount executives.After "re"-releasing all 5 movies in its "special edition" format after making the public buy all the movies in its regular "no extras" format, the executives in an effort to "save costs" decide to skimp out on the booklet. Booklets which which accompanied the previous five special edition releases!So after all that the executives manages to screw the loyal fans once again -- enough to make one FUME with rage.That's not to down grade the movie -- which is exceptional due to Nick Meyer's direction. Mr. Meyer, if you read this I hope you give the TIGHTWAD Paramount execs a piece of your mind on our behalf.
1	Fine Trek: Star Trek VI abandons the cutesy humor of the previous two films, wisely returning the series to its serious roots. Kirk and crew are swept into a Cold War game of cat-and-mouse when the Klingon emissary they're assigned to protect is assassinated. Along the way, Kirk must confront his anti-Klingon racism, while Spock faces personal challenges of his own. Darker in tone (revealed particularly well through Cliff Eidelman's effective Batman-like score) and genuinely suspenseful, the film suffers only from a sense of failed grandeur--we keep expecting to see great battlefleets that never materialize. Director Meyer's characteristic anachronisms abound--the crew sleeping in WWII-style bunkbeds; an actual galley aboard ship--but he keeps the pace right, and sexy Cattrall and Iman are welcome additions. This is the last Trek featuring all of the original crew, delivered on a DVD that looks and sounds good.
1	The Final Journey: Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country is probably the most entertaining film of the Star Trek franchise. Released in1991, 2 years after that stinker Star Trek V: The Final Frontier (It had it's brief moments, though) Kirk and crew make their final journey after 25 years of thrilling us with their adventures. Awesome special-effects, excellent acting all around, an incredibly good villian (Chang) played well by Christopher Plummer and a perfect ending, passing on the torch to the crew of Star Trek: The Next Generation. An absolutely thrilling Star Trek film to watch again and again. Kirk returned in Star Trek: Generations meeting a tragic fate at the end. If you haven't yet, add this great Star Trek film to your collection.
1	Not the best Star Trek ever but Great Price: Not the best of the Star Trek movies but none the less a must to complete the set.I paid less than $8 and got it within days, very well packaged. Great Buy!
1	The voyage home is the best: I liked all three movies but it wasn't until they got to "The search for Spock" that they got the editing right on the Star Trek movies. Very intertaining though.
1	Wierd but interesting: Attila was an interesting yet strange book. The character goes through a mixture of complex reality mixed with hallucinations. I specially enjoyed Chapter 5.
1	Used Boat Notebook: From the Pages of Sailing Magazine, Reviews of 40 Used Boats Plus a Detailed Look at Ten Great Used Boats: As expected from Sailing Magazine, a well written and comprehensive guide in the selection of great used sailboats. Covers all of the pluses and the minuses of 40 'classic plastic' sailboats from small to large. Of particular interest is the review of things to look for and problems that exist as well as performance and accomidations.
0	Not worth reading!: Still trying to validate the paper it's printed on. The only thing I liked about the book was the design of the pages. Found the essays not especially well written and am looking forward to discussing it with our book review group to see if they can actually shed some light on the issues. Guess I wasn't lonely enough to want to crawl up with this book....it made me fall asleep.
0	Author in Jail for Criminal Tax Evasion: Larken Rose has been sentenced to15 months in jail for failure to file. If you follow his advice and the IRS prosecutes, you will lose. The information in this video is100% false by the rulings of the IRS and dozens of courts in the prosecution of those who took Rose's advice. This IRS is aware of people using the fraudulent information in this video and screens returns for people making frivolous arguments such as this.The IRS has a publication entitled: "The Truth About Frivolous Arguments" - Larken Rose's arguments are among those in this publication.
1	Redemption for Eddie Murphy: Finally, a funny Eddie Murphy movie that my children can watch. Not the usual garbage mouth from Murphy.
1	Because Of The Songs & The Year:1945 was a very significant year in the history of the world, but certainly not for this movie. I was10 years old & though my parents did not go to see this movie, the song, "Don't Fence Me In" was very popular & became engraved in my heart along with "Tumbling Tumbleweeds."Since I grew up in southern CA, I saw many tumbling tumbleweeds & I am happy now to have finally seen the movie - even though it is not a particularely good movie I am giving it 4 stars just for sentimental reasons.
1	Excellent resource for busy educators: Having purchased many types of teaching resources over the last few years, I have finally found one more helpful than all the others combined. Evertson not only outlines the procedures in an easy to read manner, but she also gives excellent examples of her theories in practice. I was expecting a book that strictly dealt with keeping order in the classroom, but what I received was so much more. This book describes ways to teach that will ensure that classrooms run smoothly and more importantly the students learn. I only hope that other new teachers find this text at the beginning of their careers as the advice contained is invaluable. If your budget or time schedule only allows for one book, definitely buy this one!
0	the movie with kristi swanson was better.: i think that the show is dumb and that buffy in the movie is a senior! in the show, she's a junior. what's the deal? and i think that kristi is a much better buffy.
1	Hot Buffy Tapes a Must!: I am a die-hard Buffy fan and I was thrilled to find out that I could get the episdoes on tape. The tapes include:Welcome to the Hellmouth/ The Harvest, Witch, Never Kill a Boy on the First Date, Angel, The Puppet ShowAll of the shows are wonderful and I highly recommed that you buy them!!!!
0	Poor Product: Don't waste your money on this one. It didn't work for me right out of the package. I didn't bother to replace the batteries since the device is obviously made cheaply.
0	Touchpad mouse: I have had to use the touchpad type mouse for years due to a pinched nerve, causing my hand to go numb.The old one, from years ago was far, far better than this one! I guess they were bought out and the qualityis not so great. I cannot make the software work with Vista. They made a simple thing more compliacted.I wish that my old one had not worn out and it would work with Vista. Please, someone come up with a REALLYgood touchpad mouse for a P.C.
1	Me too...: A friend of mine turned me onto these, in one word... great! However, for my first major day of usage at a local outdoor concert, a young kid whom was looking the other way, stumbled over my footrest and broke it. Being that the footrest is really the best part of the chair, I was extremely disappointed. Unfortunately, no apology was offered. I will attempt a fix on my own, otherwise try to return or buy a new one.
0	A beach disaster: We received two chairs...the arm on the first one broke when the first person sat in it. A160 pound man, not a giant person. The second one won't fold up. So they are useless.
1	Folding Chair Reviewed: These chairs are so comfortable that we move them from the deck to the inside of the house to watch T.V.......and so easily moved that they go back out again in the morning!
1	Uniquely Superb: The Cyclical Serpent provides and excellent review of the wisdom of the ages and how they are relevant and to, and supported by, the latest astronomical observations and brilliant theories of physics that are so clearly explained by Dr. Halpern. This book makes the wonders of the universe understandable and their correlations to our every day lives observable. I highly recommend this read!
1	Great binoculars, great price: I was looking for inexpensive, but functional, binoculars to use with school groups in outdoor settings. These binoculars are WAY better than I expected for the price. The optics are crisp and the binoculars are easy to focus with the rocker-type focus (easier for kids than a dial that has to be turned). They are relatively small and lightweight (given the power). To be nit-picky, the only minor disadvantage is that they have lens caps that do not have straps to hold them to the binoculars, but that's the case with most of the binoculars that I have already. So...I'll set aside the caps and not worry about taking them into the field. The neck strap is a basic, narrow webbed strap, although the strap on the case is wider and potentially more comfortable for extended carrying.
1	Good Packaging: Good packaging, awesome for sightseeing. Has a case and covers, which adds to the protection and care of these binoculars.
1	this is a quality product, totally worth the price: I bought this for binocular for those occassional trips to the national parks. I did not want something too expensive, (as it would be for occasional trips) or too cheap (wanted something with a decent magnification for widlife watching). This is a decent size binocular. Easy to focus, thanks to the instafocus. It produces very bright and clear images, and the 7X zoom also works well for bird watching etc. Tried looking at some birds on trees in the neighbourhood. It comes with a pouch, 4 lens caps, a soft cloth for cleaning the lens and 2 shoulder straps, one for the binocular and the other for the pouch. It has a very solid, well made feel and the entire outer body is covered in rubber for better grip and protection. Overall, a very good product well worth the price.
1	Big Bang for the Buck: I bought these to carry with us in our travel trailer because they were inexpensive and from a manufacturer with a name I knew. My wife and I love them! They were easy to set up and the instructions clearly tell how to use the diopter to get perfect vision, even though I wear prescription glasses and one eye is slightly weaker than the other. We especially like the quick focus feature where you use a simple toggle lever adjustment in lieue of a dial in the center or the binoculars to focus the scene. They have a nice carrying case to protect them from scratches too.I would definitely recommend them to a friend and we might even get a second pair for the travel trailer.
0	Plain stupid: This book is stupid... the romance... the vampires... everything and why did she use that poem? Amelia never actually stated if these vampires are demon or not. They hold emotions of love and that doesn't make 'em demon...
1	I couldn't put it down: The minute I got this book I started it. From that time on, I never put it down... I loved it. I'm not a big reader, but I was so into this book, I think it is an awsome book, along with the one before it, In the Forests Of the Night. I now own them both, and plan on getting the next one soon.
0	Ugh.: I picked up this book looking for something interesting to read.And I must say I was a bit jealous to find that this author is a year younger than I am and has an array of books published.But you know what? I'm no longer jealous. Because a retarded monkey could come up with better character developments and plots than Ms. Atwater-Rhodes has put in this novel.I barely got halfway through this book when I threw it across the room, finished with the drivel that she called a story. It immediately earned a place next to Foxfire and To Ride a Silver Broomstick in my collection of "Books I would never sell to anyone for I would not want them to suffer by reading this crap."Save yourself some time and buy anything by LJ Smith, Kelley Armstrong, or (dare I say it) Anne Rice. Even Ms. Rice is better than this girl, and I hate that woman.
0	Over Hyped: This book is many times more shallow then I would have expected from such a praised writer. For all the magazines (Teen, Y.M etc...) I expected to read a story with some depth.Not one with simple, personalitiless characters that easily fall into cliches. But this is not the only problem the entire concept is done in an amaturish manner.It's obvious within minutes of starting the story it was written by someone without any real-world-experience.The only thing that this book accomplished was to prove that Hype can't make a story.
0	Horrible teenybopper fluff: "Demon In My View" (the title is lifted from Poe's poem "Alone")contains nothing of redeeming value, or any serious literary merit. I think any 6-yr old could produce better art while half-asleep. The story is trite, confused, slow, and stereotypical. The editor should be immediately fired for letting this into the market. The annoying social consciousness, laughable teenage "angst," and downright idiocy will appeal to the "Dawsons Creek" crowd I am sure, but this is not for me, or any other discerning and intelligent reader.
1	And I don't have short arms.........: I had shoulder surgery and had to buy a recliner to sleep in as I healed. I am 5'8" and don't have stubby arms but I could not reach the handle to put the legs down on the recliner. I saw this and purchased it. My whole family is glad, since even my 6'2" husband and father had trouble reaching it to.
0	Big Need for this Solution, Poor Design in the Execution: I am an Ergonomics Consultant with VERY short arms. This product looked like just what I needed to be able to reach the handle on my recliner without over-extending my right shoulded. I injured it about a year ago, and it has been difficult for me to reach the handle more than ever.Unfortunately the design of the product made it only slightly easier for me to reach the handle and the hard metal handle stuck out into the walk way and I must have hit my leg on it 5 times before I decided to return it. I applaud Standers for their attempt at addressing this issue, but they missed the mark in my opinion when it came to design.
0	Left hangng: Troll Quest is a well written book until you get to the last chapter where the author appears to have just gotten tired of writing. The book builds slowly, a well written storyline headed for a climactic finale and then the reader is left hanging with no conculsions and no sequel. Very frustrating and disappointing.
1	Now this is fun....: Besides thrills,laughter,easy readings,great conversations and a bit of mystery and a lot of suspense,you will get a fine dose of humour.McBain at his funny best.
0	Do not buy this book: This book has so many mistakes it should be used as a door stop or fuel for the fireplace. I ended up referring back to inside VC++ 5.0 and looking at the COM section in that book. If you need to learn about com see gopalan sureshes web site. He give practical information on COM and CORBA.
0	what a piece of waste!: this book goes on and on and on about the same thing. the author must love to hear him self rambling in a empty space. there is no useful information in this book. if you want to learn COM and DCOM, buy microsoft press's books.
0	I wouldn't take this book from a friend for free.: Here's a little blurb from the "Why is COM Needed" section:"... Each compiler produces a set of machine language instructions (binary numbers) that are designed to be fed by the operating system into the CPU of the computer in structured ways to produce program behavior....".With gems like that early in the book, how could I take the rest of the book seriously as a technical work? I pressed on, but basically the rest of the book seemed disorganized and filled more with studying example output from "wizards" and such.Maybe if you're looking to study micros~1 Visual Studio "wizard" output, then this book is for you. If you're looking for a solid understanding of the basics, stay away.BTW, ALL authors should lay off the lame attempts at humor. Readnig bad attempts at humor are much worse than reading a technical book that is dry.
1	Great Stuff: The reviewer was quite rough. Not every song on this CD is great, but it has some of the most rockinest music I have ever heard for the most part, especially the first two tracks.
1	great album: I luckily found this cd at a used bookstore. It was a great find, since it is hard to get now a days. I had first heard it when I was in college. It is one of those albums that sticks with you years later. It is a great driving cd. The songs are upbeat and groovy that make you happy.
1	Bunuel at his best: This was the first Bunuel movie I saw and it stays my favorite. I saw it in the movie theater and by the end 70% of spectators had left. The reason was that they were not prepared for Bunuel (It was in Gorki, Soviet Union,1986 or 87). I wasn't either but I fell in love with the movie from the very begining. It stupid to try to reveal the plot, because there's none. If you ask me, the plot of this movie is the same as in That Obscure Object of Desire (my second best Bunuel): You can't get what you crave for. For it's not the plot that matters, it's the mood, l'ambiance. And those little things like the story about Brigadier. If you have never seen a Bunuel film, start with this one!
1	Short, but pretty good.: In UC0079 Zeon learns of a new type of Gundam being built on the colony of Libot. They send a spec ops team to investigate. Bernie's Cyclops is shot down on the mission and he meets a boy named Al. Al is infatuated with mobile suits and follows Bernie around on his mission. Al's neighbor is actually the test pilot of the new machine. As this story unfolds their lives will be changed forever.This Gundam series is only 6 episodes. It's is a bit older so the animation is very dated, but the story is pretty good. Even though this is one of the weaker Gundam series it's still good and worth taking the time time to watch.
1	Best gundam show: I would consider this one of the best gundam series. Highly recommend if one were interested in any gundam series.
0	I got Snaked: This cable looks good, feels good, is easy to use, but only works if the ends are wiggled and twisted. I could not get it to connect correctly on two different amps and one electric guitar. Pass on this one. A lesson learned; you get what you pay for!
0	Assembly is a bit tricky: Disappointed that I found it impossible to assemble the stands. You have to watch out that there are different length pre-drilled holes at the different ends of the pillars. I also didn't have an extensive toolkit to be able to redrill and enlarge the pre-drilled holes to make the assembly much easier. Things were so tight, I couldn't drive the screws in even with a powertool. Otherwise they looked good quality construction and should suit smaller sized rear surround speakers. With appropriate planning you should be able to avoid breaking screws like I did. Onecall don't pay for return shipping and Sanus were happy to send replacement parts, but I decided to return the item anyway. Maybe you'll have more success.
1	Best Futuristic Maiden CD: This CD is another wonderful CD of legendary NWOHM Band Iron Maiden !!!Listen "Heaven Can't wait" and "Wasted Years" , and you'll see why these songs are in almost every Live Concerts of Maiden ....Particularly I love "Deja Vu", It's melodics chords make me feel in another place in another world.....Really It's fantastic...Also it's portrait is the best cover design of Maiden Albums....I recommend !!!!!
1	MASTERPIECE!!: Simply put, the best Iron Maiden album ever made. If you consider yourself even romotely a Maiden fan, you already own this album.

0	Barebones re-release: The He-man and She-ra Christmas Special has a special place close to my heart. This is why it makes me so sad to see such a barebones release. This DVD has absolutely no extras (well, it does have a chapter selection?). This is not even a remastered transfer. What makes this edition even more redundant is the fact that in 2005 there was another version that was loaded with extras.Skip this release as theHe-Man & She-Ra - A Christmas Special(2005) is the one you want. Unfortunately, it is out of print, but you can still get it from some sellers (albeit at a slightly higher price).
0	NOT A Learning Book: This book would have been better had it not included "Learning" in the title. This is not a book for learning how to program in Java. Instead, this book plays a lot more like an overview of core concepts in Java for practicing programmers. This book would probably have been better suited in the "Nutshell" series, but even as a reference, it's a rather weak text because it keeps pretending to be instructional. This book is pointless.This book is absolutely not for novice programmers. You have to have some experience with the C/C++ language and OOP concepts to really get the meat of this book.This book does include a *few* things that are nice for novices to know, but it's nothing you won't find in any other book on the topic.
1	no title: From the producers of "The Terminator" and "Aliens" and it shows. Practically nonstop mayhem. And very much like the last two Mad Max movies, particularly in the costumes, makeup, and the town, which somewhat resembled Barter Town. Liotta, however, is no Mel Gibson; there didn't seem to be that hardness at his core that Gibson can project. However, I did thoroughly enjoy it in spite of the constant violence. Was filmed in Australia, with some gorgeous scenery shots. But far too much violence and very graphic. Although its message was good. I would think some scenes here could cause nightmares among the young and the more susceptible. There's really nothing wrong with the movie's plot; it's just that we're now too good in the technical department, and can make violence so real these days. Maybe we need to downgrade here, and not be so graphic.
1	Pretty Good: Contrary to the other reviews,I didn't have any problems with these headphones. I had them hooked up in a few minutes, it was very simple. The only thing to wait for is the batteries to charge. I walked around the house and outside without any problems and was outside before I had a little distortion, but nothing too major. I wear a size 7 and 3 quarters baseball hat and had no trouble with these fitting my huge head. They are adjustable to somebody much smaller and also much larger than myself. I do think this is a great product considering JVC website has them for130 bucks and I bought them on Ebay for18 bucks new in the box. I will be buying these for my friends and family for Christmas, an excellent product.
0	Don't bother!: After reading mixed reviews, I purchased this product. It was to be used outside but wasn't tried out until several months later. BIG MISTAKE! I'm sure the HAW300RF is as bad. If you turn your head, you lose the signal even well within range even in the same room! Garbage!
0	Aurora Leigh from general books publishers: I bought this book (General Books edition) from Amazon, and am more than disappointed with it. It is scanned and unedited. It is illegible! Now I will have to buy another copy from a reputable publisher. EBB's poem is wonderful! This edition is simply unreadable!
0	A letdown: Doesn't even remotely compare (IMVHO) to her ecstatic1999 live offering, Electrica. The only saving grace is "Para De Chorar," the very funky club-style bonus track. Even favorites that could've saved this set (like usually-amazing "Ill Parole Negra") come off weak. And Mercury's vocals here (again, save the studio track) sound overworked and, at times, (dare I say) half-assed. I am a longtime fan of Daniela and her band, but this one disappointed on first few listens. Who knows, though. Maybe it'll grow on me. (Stranger things have happened...)
0	broke on the first use: I purchased this on the strength of the Mr. Clean name. Big mistake. The handle and mop head parted ways on the first use and refused to be reunited! There was no direction on the packaging on what to do if this happened, the web site was useless, and the 800 number isn't manned on weekends (which is when I do most of my cleaning). After thirty minutes of trying to fit the handle back onto the mop head, I gave up. Everytime I fit it together, the top popped off again. This was a waste of money and time. I would NOT recommend this product to anyone.
1	A Real Lesson that can be applied to life: Snow White-a tale of terror isn't just a tale that is merely entertainment. This tale actually teaches you about life. It's very real, dark and hopeful at the same time. I loved Lili and her courage to defeat the evil stepmother. I liked how it was a battle between good and evil. I think it has a lot to teach about vanity, jealousy, and deception. Not to forget, LOVE. Real Love! Lili was a courageous character and I aspire to be like her.
0	are you kidding me ? so much for the hype.: This movie couldn't hold our attention tonight. Painful to watch in so many ways. Gruesome, really dark take on snow white which looked interesting at first blush. If only there was something more than shock and bland dialogue! Just didn't do it for us. Given the positive reviews I guess we're in the minority.
1	I became a documentarian because of this film.: After seeing this film, I literally changed career paths from narrative to documentary filmmaking.It's authenticity and depth is unmatched by many other documentaries, probably due to the relationship between the documentarian and the subject. If you haven't seen Apocalypse Now, watch that first. I also recommend to anyone that loves Apocalypse Now to see this documentary, because you will have a greater appreciation for both of them.
0	Pact With The Devil doesnt pack a punch or a hit: This movie is about a man named Louis, played by Ethan Erickson (The In Crowd, Tv's Buffy The Vampire Slayer), and he becomes a model, and his manager is the wilyeyed Henry, played by Malcolm McDowell. McDowell tells Louis about the story of Dorian Gray and how he made a pact with the devil. Louis or Dorian now writes in blood and he soon has eternal youth. This very interesting movie gets it fuel towards the middle but it can't help it. Very predictable. Malcolm McDowell (A Clockwork Orange, I:Spy) is wasted in my mind and why the hell is this movie introducing Ethan Erickson? He has been in a movie or two before this and a tv series..come on people get with it. Erickson is an ok actor and he does some ok acting in this. Unspeakably boring for a while, then it gets a shot of something and then it goes into a coma.
0	Bad book: Although there are only a few books currently discussing about the internal of JVM, this book is the worst of them. It copies too many pages such as the bytecode semantics from the JVM specification by Sun Microsystems and these parts consume around half of the books. Also most contents not borrowed from JVM specification is far too simple to be an indepth discussion of JVM. It only took me 2 hours to read the whole book and to find out that it is a bad book.
0	Save your money...: This book tries to cover topics in a very abstract way. You do not get a feel for the components that make up a VI project. It barely touches on Design Time Controls. It just tells the user what these things are, I could have found that out by looking at the help files of VI. I need some pratical examples of how to use these components, which this book has miserably failed to provide. There is no source code availble on their web site either like they say. I went there and their web site kept giving me errors. In short, if you are looking for help on building useful sites buy another book.
0	Contents need more explanation and depth: A lots of mumble-jumble materials which never really materialized for once. The instructions at times can be very frustrating with its example and procedures on showing you how to use InterDev. In the end, for me anyway, I find other books, even if they were not specificly written for Visual Interdev 6, offered more useful references and materials that actually kept me refering back to them from time to time.
0	This Chair is bad: It would not support100lbs. It fell apart as soon as my hind end hit it. If your looking for an outdoors chair, DONT get this one! Just givin some info, SHADY
1	bread flour: Excellent quality flour for bread making. This is the 2nd time I have ordered it and will definitely continue!
0	uhhhhh: when i first heard this album it was garbage,now im in to hip hop like krs-one tribe called quest kweli,but this album is completely lacking tight lyrics or beats please dont buy this album unless you are collecting lol
0	Technically Inaccurate: I bought this book because I am working on a software project that involves Exchange 2000. However, the book's author does not use proper terminology. For example, they talk about SAM replication times but Exchange 2000 uses Active Directory. They talk about site connectors but Exchange 2000 uses Routing Group Connectors. I know this product is still in Beta, but RC2 is feature complete. This book could have been better. Only buy this if you absolutely need to implement Exchange 2000 ASAP. If you read Microsoft's documentation first, you can weed through this book for more details.
0	Recent purchase: I can't really say anything about the product because I have not recieved it. I bought the item in late September and was promised to be delievered early October but never recieved it. It is now October 31, and the item is still not here.
0	Piss poor unoriginal mallcore: Don't waste your time buying this garbage. This band has the worst singer, no memorable guitar hooks or riffs, some leads but isn't enough to redeem them from the hordes of crappy and redundant hardcore stylings. The bottom line is I've heard it done better by many other bands. If you want something that will expand your mind with crazy offbeats then I would recommend bands like Arsis, Dillenger Escape Plan,or anything by Mastadon. These guys suck and I have no idea why the hell they are touring with Megadeth. I hope they get booed off stage. They should have gotten Municipal Waste to open up.
0	Horrible Song: Nelly is doing more singing than Janet Jackson is on this clunker that alone spells trouble. dime a dozen track with no feeling or meaning. this is a ok B-side but not worthy of a lead off single&especially not worthy to remember the Control project from 20 years back. but Janet Jackson has been played out for well over a Decade to me&this song only adds to that point.
1	Good book, but Deathly Serious: Elvis Cole used to be more of a smartass and, I hate to say it, I miss the old smartass days. Now, everything is deathly serious and I'm having trouble enjoying Crais' books as much. It's a pity, too, because he's a good writer. It seems like, from time to time, writers write really great books and then get "serious" about their craft not realizing that the humor leavens the work and without it the writing pulls the reader down. This book puts people close and dear to Elvis in proximity to dangerous, evil people, subject matter much too grim for no smiles at all.
0	The LAst Detective Audio Book: I love the Elvis Cole Series by Robert Crais. I am not reviewing the author or the book, but my purchase. My CD was incomplete. It covered the first chapter, 31 minutes. The rest of the audio was deleted, or just wasn't there. I was very disappointed.The Last Detective (Elvis Cole) [Abridged][Audiobook] (Audio CD)Alvin
0	Surprized: I have been a fan of Robert Crais, thats why I was VERY SURPRIZED with The Last Detective. I was dissapointed at its length at first, 300 pages, but James Lee Burke can write a great book in just 300 pages, so, maybe can Crais. I was wrong! Very dissapointing. And what was the bear thing all about?
1	Elvis Cole is back again!: The return of Elvis Cole is well worth the wait. Robert Crais moves Elvis right into action during the first chapter. He is caring for his girlfriend's son and in just one moment the boy disappears. The ensuing search for the boy centers upon's Elvis's Vietnam memories, and a box hidden in his closet that contains medals and pictures. This is not a mystery solved easily- lots of turns and tangles. Old nemesis and the return of Carol Stanger from a previous novel keep this storyline fresh and right on the edge of your seat. Action and deep thought are all a part of the story. Elvis digs deep to keep his relationship with the boy's mom on an even keel, but this may bethe last chance that won't work out. The return of Det. Stangergives us renewed hope that she will be part of Elvis Cole's nextcase and maybe a new romance...
0	the stitching came apart in the left shoe tongue.: poor craftship when it came to the stitching. they look an feel good but, they started coming apart an I only wore them slightly.
1	Daigrepont's best album.: I'm a big fan of Daigrepont, but not always a fan of his albums, which are pretty uneven. When I want to hear him play this is what I put on.A lot of Cajun music is wedded to tradition, but Daigrepont feels free to experiment. "Bebe de la Famille," for example, has a Caribbean touch. "Bonjour, Dimanche," about a farmowner who's been up all night throwing a party and is listening to the countryside wake up at dawn, is the trickiest song here, simultaneously evoking the narrator's bleary state and the farmyard's early-morning bustle. Daigrepont is expanding the tradition, though, not leaving it behind. There's still bouncy party music like "Tipitina Two-Step," a slow one about his uncle's store where you could speak Cajun French and gamble, and covers of songs by Canray Fontenot and Wade Fruge.All of Daigrepont's albums have good songs, but this one's something special. The worst you can say about anything here is that it's merely good.
1	Mind Bomb does just that!!!: I have such a huge cd collection and I recently went back to listen to some cds I had not given some play in sometime. I cranked up Mind Bomb in the new system and this freakin' cd is so full of great guitar riffs, keyboards, and awesome vox's. It is so unfortunate that it did not get the respected air play in its time. I saw in them "live" here in San Antonio when they opened up for Robhalford's "Fight" project, and they kicked some ass. I recommend this cd. GET IT!!!!!! if you can find.
1	Great book: I chose this rating because it is so adventurous to me! I would recommend this book to anyone who likes immigration and labor movement. But even if you don't please at least try a sample of the book please!
1	You have to buy good books for your family: It's a very good book for my13'th daughter. We live in México and the english teachers recomended us to buy this book
1	I think this book is outstanding.: I'm reading "Letters From Rifka," and I think it is a real interesting book.I think this book is real interesting bacause its a really good mystery book.I mean you never know whats going to happen because Rifka is always getting into something new.THese are reasons why I adore "Letters From Rifka".
0	It never arrived: I paid for it, i need it next week, i've filed a claim, but still no book? How can i review a service when that service was never provided?I will update this review if and when i actually get what i paid for.James McDonald
1	A95 Disks: If you use the Canon A95, this disk is all you will need plus some. You will never run out of disk space. I like the ease of use and the large capacity. Chances are that if you are not a pro, the1mb disk may be too much space and you may only need something smaller like the 512mb.
0	Pricy: Of course as all things computer related, as soon as this was purchased the price dropped drastically. Unit works great but buy the 2 gig. More bang for the $$
0	Slow performance, bad for large megapixel cameras: My main problem with this Compact Flash is that the "real-time" performance is very slow. I bought it a year ago for my 5-Megapixel camera, and it makes me wait a long time before I can take my next photo. This gets frustrating when you miss good photo opportunities.Then, I read this article which reviews Compact Flash cards, and I realized that this particular SanDisk product line is inferior.The review at DP Review says this Sandisk writes at 6x (where 'x' =150 KB/sec). I since then, have purchased a 512MB Transcend compact flash which claims to Write at 25x. My camera works much faster now. I have borrowed my friend's IBM Microdrive and that is really fast too.
1	More phisolophical than technical for sure: The book provides some clues on how errors should be considered. It spends a lot of time describing the current situation in a very verbose style. OK that's fun but not very instructive (I mean, we all know half the messages are stupid, unfounded, incomprehensible, etc.). This beeing said I would recommend the book for the same reason....
1	Bulk Soaker Hose Comparison: Fiskars ceased making bulk soaker hose in 96'. Excellent product and system using there black and yellow compression fittings. I found an online retailer that carries the same product (part #120, .580 bulk soaker hose in100' 500' rolls) with many more items, hose sizes in there product lineup. It appears they have a new formula as of June of 2010, that works so much like the original Fiskars. The mfg. is [...]
0	okay but cheap looking: These earrings are not worth more than the $5 I paid, but they are cute and the company shipped all items promptly. The "dangle" part of the earring above the colored beads look like cheap plastic beads stacked on top of each other.
0	It [stinks]: How anyone could think this was scarier than the first is beyond me. It was so [weak]. Freddy was good for one movie okay, no more Freddy, he's dead face it, people don't like scary movies anymore, they like Scream. Horror is diseased. Too the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Friday the13th, Nightmare on Elm Street, and Halloween I'm sorry. RIP. We will no longer get real horror. We had a peak with The Exorcist, and went down hill from there. The first was scary, the rest [stink]!
1	A great horror movie:: This is a good movie. I love the nightmare on elm street movies.The last one isn't that good though but it's okay. The older ones are the best because they deal with teens. Patricia arquette plays in this. Buy it.
0	Dwarf Cichlids by david Boruchowiztz: I was very disappointed by this book. Vague and woolly. It didn't address the specifics needs for breeding Apistogrammas for example. Great pictures, but you can get great pictures free on the net. The quality of the photography is first rate and if you want a book just for browsing occasionally then its fine.
1	An original mix!: OK, this is an odd mix! but some of the tracks are great! It has everything from the blues to Ska! However, the track which will gain most attention is George Harrison's. Harrison's voice sounds in faltering shape! The Eric Clapton is a good track, and there are many gems in this album!
1	New Family Favorite!: I was so pleased to find this movie on DVD & at a great price! This movie was one of my most favorites as a child & now I am able to enjoy it with my fiance & kids. It is the perfect level of creepy & mystery for kids to enjoy & not end up terrified.
0	Boot Legged Product ???: The movie was like a boot legged video... NOT a Disney movie, NO Walt Disney Castle Credit or anything Disney. Beginning scene as I saw when I was younger was missing and you could see blippy black, white and yellow spots on the screen like you would see in an older projection film.No chapter/scene selections or anythingNOT worth the $18 ...
1	A Christmas Classic: I bought this CD when it first came out and it's still my favorite after all these years. She is at her best on this CD. A winner that is sure to please!
0	Mariah Carey: MC can't sing: she's just another Whitney Houston imitator whose only entertainment value is showing off her body!The traditional Christmas Carol "Joy to the World " track is positively contaminated, no.. blasphemed, by mixing in parts of the 3 Dog Nite song of the same title.In summary, this album SUCKS!!!
1	This is a must have...even if you have the original!: Two bonus songs...fantastic. The videos...fantastic.The video for "O Holy Night"...gives me the chills!The picture is so clear and her performance is flawless.Worth every penny to purchase this CD/DVD.Go now...buy it!
1	Loved it: Love me some Mariah Carey. This was actually a repurchase of a CD we wore out...had to get a new one.
0	A Bad Bad christmas album.: This album is so cheesy, it makes me wnat to puke and swallow my own intestines. What was Mariah thinking by producing such vomit-inducing rubbish!!!
0	Sappy, childish, commercial...: ...no depth at all in this CD. Mariah has no "angel" at all. Ridiculous CD. Don't get it.
0	Mariah has proven herself to be an industry tramp.......: 2005 has shown the true side of mariah, and has shown her greed and hatred for her fans. She knows that they will buy anything that has her name on it, and she is effectively exploiting this!!!!mariah is a ho ho ho ho ho ho!!
0	Legacy Yea Right!!!!!: Both The Lable & the Band are Guilty of Pissing Down the Leg of One of the true Great american Rock bands, Like The Other truely Great American Rock band (Cheap Trick) we have been bombarded with Cut rate compilations of past glory, What the band really has told it's fans is This, We have nothing Tangible to say we have milked our cow dry But we are not quite done Fleecing you so Give us your money because we spent most of our fortune sticking things In our noses & veins so Give us more money beause we are now addicted to your hard earned Cash. stay away from this & all further released albums by this band until they give us more than Hits or Live compilations or Rehashed Blues numbers from artists who did them better in the first place save you money & buy yourself a Muddy Waters CD or a willie Dixon cd see where these rip off artists bit thier style from in the first place
1	Now they saying Ms. before they mention your name, girl!: I feel as though I have been waiting on this CD forever. I have always been a Kelly fan, even back in the day when she with "Beyonce & the other girls", also know as Destiny's child.Beyonce has an overpowering voice that at times can get annoying, although I still love her, but Kelly's voice more soft and smooth. This cd showcases her talents as singer as well as a talented writer.After the BET awards, I was a little afraid as to what this cd might sound like, however after listening to the cd, I've decided that I will just chalk up the bad performance to nerves.I can't wait for more from Ms Kelly.Track Listings and ratings.1.Like This - 4/52.Comeback 5/5 One of my favorites3.Ghetto - 4/54.Work - 5/55.Flashback-3/56.Every Thought is You 4/57.The Show- 4/58.Interlude9.Still In Love With My Ex 5/510.Love - 4/511.Better Without You - 5/512.This is Love-3/5I just wish there were more songs!!!
0	Teach yourself how not to waste money on worthless books.: Not only did I waste money on this worthless book, I wasted a fortune on trying to sell my home using the advise of this guy. By the time I'm done, what little profit I made will surely go to my attorney to keep the buyers of my home off my back.
1	Great Hardy: Good book. Hardy's descriptions of astronomy are beautiful. The characters of Lady Constantine and Swithin are well developed, and Swithin's conflict between love and science moves the book.If I have one complaint, the characters apart from Constantine and Swithin aren't as well developed as a book like Far from the Madding crowd. Jan Coggan, the Maltster, and Laban Tall are one of the best parts of Far from the Madding Crowd, and that is missing from this book. The parson is developed, but he's not funny or lively.
1	Another Unhappy Hardy Ending: If you like Thomas Hardy and unhappy endings, then you will like this book. This Jude the Obscure meets The Return of the Native, but shorter.
1	Greatest movie ever: What can I say? This is my favorite movie. Don't buy it tho unless your a deep thinker that sees lots of depth in zombie movies. Enjoy!!!
0	No.: This movie makes no sense.The title character is introduced as an immoral zombie-killer, who picks up grieving trophy wife bimbos at the cemetery where he works. Later he transitions into a blubbery psychotic mess over the loss of a chick he knew for two days and didn't even seal the deal with. Only to meet multiples of her, one of whom has a phobia of erections...If you LOVE zombie movies, stay away. The makeup is terrible, the acting is mediocre, plot? What plot? The zombie action is boring. There's no connection with any of the characters and you spend the last 3/4 of the movie hoping everyone dies.
1	Dark atmosphere, sexy love interest, great gore!!: Having seem my share of zombie flicks I still can't bring myself to seriously consider them fine film making, but Dellamorte Dellamore comes the closest to keeping my interest for the entire screening.Taking place in old cemetary in Italy, Rupert Everett plays a cemetery watchman who matter-of-factly dispatches zombies with the coolness of Clint Eastwood in a Spaghetti Western using his trusty sidearm.I must confess the acting, aside from Rupert's is 'B' movie quality, but I was consistantly drawn into the movie's eerie setsand the antics of baffoonishly sickening sidekick Gnaghi, played by Francois Hadji-Lazaro and naturally Anna Falchi is a sight to behold by any standards.The gore effects are above average and serve the story in appropriate quanities.I've not seen other films directed by Michael Sovai but this one makes me hope I do. According to IMDB this is the last movie he's made, apparently not a most prolific director.
0	Extremely Disappointing!: All of these positive reviews, calling this the greatest movie of all time are way off base. What makes this movie so great? There are tons of Italian Zombie movies out there and a good 95% of them are better than this drivel.After reading all of these reviews calling this a "classic" I went in expecting something of an "Evil Dead" or "Dead Alive" type of film which are filled with gore and have some nice comedic bits. "Cemetery Man" is simply BORING, that's right it BORING! Slowly paced, dim witted and down right JUNK!If you want to see a good Italian zombie flick check out some of Lucio Fulci's work like "Zombie", "City of The Living Dead" or "The Beyond" all superior works compared to this god awful movie. Save yourself about 2 hours of your life and stay away from this extremely boring film.
0	Terrible movie: This was a total waste of 90 minutes of my life. Terrible, boring, stupid, and senseless don't begin to describe this waste of film. How anyone can rate it 4 or 5 starts is beyond me. I think I'm open minded. I watch horror, slasher, foreign and suspense films all the time. This has nothing going for it. It is NOT scary in the least. And the special effects are about as well done as a high school play. This is just garbage. I would have given it zero stars, but that's not an option.
0	Cemetary Man: Italians are good at Gore, but fail at plot. The movie plot was all over the place. DO NOT waste you time watching more Italian gory junk!
0	More of the same: Yet another movie that presents the psuedo-gospel of "get right with God so you don't have to go to hell with all the other sinners". If you've seen left behind, omega code, etc. This is only different in having a smaller budget, smaller plot, and equally bad acting. Someone please start making movies about the life of fullness and great joy that Jesus invited people to rather than another fire insurance movie like this one. How many do we need? Who are they for? I am sure God can use this for His glory and purposes, but I found it rather dissappointing.
1	Christian movie for Anyone. Plus the Rapture.: The sign of the times are all present and sooner or later the world dictator will make his debut onto the world scene. The movie "Six" even though it is a movie is a close representation of what it will be like in a couple of years. Six talks about the Tribulation time in where all people on this earth will have to use a mark on there right hand or forehead in order to buy and sell anything in the market. The cash society will be non-existent. This is a great movie for the Christian person and for the person who does not know Jesus Christ and who wants to, who wants to change to the Christian Religion. People laugh at this time from ever occurring but if you look at the news things are going on which only indicate that the Lord will be coming soon.Pray alot, and hope to get picked up during the Rapture. As for Six the movie, get it, and watch it, and learn from it.
0	continued disappointment: The author puts forth a "New view' and changes his story characters so then I didn't get my wish of 'how I would have hoped Soalme's d. turned out.'
1	Excelent book: I received my book from within15days insteadof 8 weeks they told me, excelent and i love this item, signed as they said, very nice buy.
0	THE ALBUM THAT ALMOST DESTROYED HELLOWEEN....: In this album Helloween tried something new, but without a clear direction the album turned out to be a loser, confusing his hard-core fans and gaining almost none new ones.
0	''Why Helloween Why'': This one is nothing compare with the oder helloween albuns.Chameleon and Pink bubles don't have the real heloween music. I prefere the bands new and old albuns.
0	WORST HELLOWEEN ALBUM: Why can't people recognize the fact that after Kai Hansen left, Helloween was gone for sure ?? See what Gamma Ray is doing and compare it with what Helloween has been doing ... Anyway, I'm not saying that all Helloween albuns after Michael Weikath took control are horrible. But this "CHAMELEON" is. It is exactly whjat its name means: a transformation of metal into garbage.
0	Piece of junk: Helloween almost was destroyed forever after this turkey, who flopped simpkly because it really was that bad. The band tried to "innovate", adding a lot of keyboards, horns and whatever, in a mixture of poorly written songs that nobody will ever remember, and that were scrapped forever from their live set. AS a result, singer Michael Kiske and drummer Ingo Schwichtenberg were fired (for differente reasons), the band lost their contract with EMI and had to start all over agains, never totally recovered from guitarrist Kai Hansen's loss.
0	Good unit except.....: As a previous poster already stated this unit only supports up to 2GB SD cards. Unless Philips releases a firmware update for SDHC cards or you have a large supply of 2GB or less SD cards stay away from this unit. Other than this major shortcoming, it's a pretty good device.
1	WONDERFUL ENTERTAINTMENT: Don't seek any academic insights from this book. This is a piece of pure entertainment, full of memories and anecdotes that can brighten up a hundred dinner tables over the years. Hoveyda was a founder of France's snootiest film review, the Cahiers du Cinema, but writes with the ease and wit of a free spirit. While recalling his friendship with many of the innovative film-makers of the last century, Hoveyda also debunks some of the myths about the New Wave and independent cinema. A READER IN LONDON
1	Ooooooh my Godddddddddd !!!: Like most of Betty Carter's albums, this one demands patience, attention, availability. You cannnot appreciate HER music if you want to discover all the riches at once. If you're a man, you got to be a gentleman. It's been three days now that I keep listening to "It's not about the melody". I did not want to talk about it, because it's so beautiful... You know what I mean? It's a bit like when you got a beautiful girlfriend, you're not going to yell at everybody that you've got a beautiful girl friend, are you?... See what I mean? ... Huh, what did I say? nothing. OK, I must be going now........
1	Excellent and forceful: The stories are of two types here -- short, one page sketches that verge on being prose poems, and longer, fuller stories which still contain an elusive quality. Although critics, to a man, preferred the longer stories, I find the shorter ones equally compelling. The writing is first-rate; it is nuanced, poetic, and contains a wealth of psychological insight. I think this is Phillps's greatest accomplishment: her merging of the psychological and the political in stories that are always accessible. Those looking for pretension will find it only with reviewers who trash sophisticated story-tellers while including the (see more about me) tag at the beginning of their own reviews.
0	Didn't much care for it.: I didn't much cre for this book. It had too much sex stuff and not really any stories to follow. I thought it would be a good book, too since other well-known authors have praised it so well. I do not see what all the fuss was about.
0	Say, wha?: Um, can you say one of the worst movies ever? The only man that fell here was me..falling for the price of renting this horrible movie! Lifeless, dreary, and humorless. Perhaps has something to do with the depressing plot: A loser janitor (Dylan Baker), listens to opera and has emotional and social issues. Fast forward to he meets up with another loser (Hutton), and his loser shop-lifting wife (Stone). Stone looks stoned. Stone looks yucky. Somewhere I lost interest. I think it was like right after the opening credits. No. Maybe it was the awful acting. Still, it could have been the lack of a coherent plot, I don't really know or care. But if you want a "gripping psychological thriller" as the box claims, then you'll do yourself a favor and keep looking. What a waste of talent.
1	Lots of good Information and facts.: This book helps a lot. It teaches you how to train, when to train, what sorts of things you should do, and different foods to eat. This will help you prepare. It is a great purchase.
0	bad to the bone: this movie sucked, it was better than the dreamchild but the worst one, the deaths were ridiculous and it had to much humour, the ending was a total let down, the fight between Freddy and his daughter was not a big finale, this movie was a waste of my time, and if your looking for a good movie, this is not a good choice, even die hard freddy fans won't like this, even the acting was bad, don't rent this or buy it, worst Freddy movie
1	"I'll get you my pretty and your little soul too": I loved this Nightmare film, this, the1st one and the 3rd are my top fav 3 out the series.This one has no horror, but it has the most comedy ever, Freddy will make you laugh your ass off in this one.My fav part is when hes playing the video game, so brilliant. And when hes messing with that dude with the ear plug, really cool.
0	Is Freddy dead yet?: Just a typical Freddy sequel that is actually quite good. A few good deaths and wise cracks. Although they seemed to finish Freddy off quite quickly that it would seem like they had another sequel planned.
0	sucked!!!: this one just stunk overall there is no dought about that. after 5 I thought it couldn't get worse, well it did in this one.
1	Freddy's done it again!: This movie was great. Robert Englund was holarious. The graphics and special effects were great. I thought there could been more body count though. It was a great combination of horror and comedy. I think you should see it.
0	0 STARS: AWFUL!!: "Freddy's Dead- The Final Nightmare" is a terrible installment to what was a great horror movie series. This movie is a total joke just like the previous two sequels before it...this garbage, a horror movie?? Give me a break!! This movie is not scary...it's ridiculous!! I highly recommend sticking with parts1-3, which are undoubtedly the only "NOES" movies that should have ever been made. This movie sucks...shame on the people that made this trash.
0	3-D Sequences barely save this sub-par finish to the series: To fully appreciate this film you have to either seen it in the theater or have a DVD player. The 3D sequence is the film's saving glory. The film seems like it was rushed because the script is bland. I think if the film had brought back Wes Craven then maybe it would've been a superior finish to one of the greatest film series in history.
0	Same ol' song and dance: A friend of mine bought this book and shouldn't have. Laura Schellhardt isn't a seasoned pro at screenwriting, she is a TEACHER. Not a good one at that.Yes, the book is informative, but it doesn't say anything different that any other book does, other than the Screenwriter's Bible by David Trottier. Trottier is a professional writer with numerous credits under his belt. So my advice is to "Schell" out an extra dollar so you can buy the Screenwriter's Bible and just leave Screenwriting for Dummies alone.
0	Pseudo-science: Lomborg's book may appear to consist of logical arguments, and therefore appeals to many, but closer examination reveals this not to be the case.I would urge other readers of the book to treat Lomborg's work with the same view to skepticism as Lomborg himself...
0	Soft targets and biased selection: This book pays little attention to the peer reviewed scientific literature on environmental problems. That is the basis for policy and has established the seriousness of many environmental problems. In addition to picking "soft targets" of writings by advocates, the book ignores inflated claims by industry about the economic losses that will accompany environmental regulation. This demonstrates its lack of balance.
0	Very misleading and shallow: So many people will believe anything they read if it agrees with their beliefs. This book contains errors and distortions. Unfortunately, the reviewers just add to the confusion. For example:"...government workers faked lynx presence..." Sorry, it didn't happen. Read the follow-ups, not just the first headline. Visit the Audubon Magazine website for a comprehensive article on the incident.The marine harvest data is flawed. China has been lying about their catches for years. Even the not very left-leaning U.S. News reported that yields have been dropping dramatically. "Marine sleuths find that faulty numbers from Beijing have masked a worldwide drop in catches".This book is recommended for the person who wants to refute arguments about environmental problems and doesn't care about accuracy and facts.
0	Outdated and Uneducated: An environmental book written by a statistician! 90% of all statistics can be used to show either side of the argument 50% of the time! This author uses this skill liberally.The first chapter makes a very valid point: be aware of what you're reading and be skeptical! The rest of the book is slanted toward his OPINION and he disregards information that doesn't support his viewpoints.Many things may not be as bad as some portray but they aren't as rosy as this author portrays either. READ WITH SKEPTICISM!!
0	Not the best: Wether this verson has been updated and cleaned up, doesn't really matter.What I've seen is a very poor recording, very bad sound (that makes it hard to hear what is being said),and bad picture quality.A film from the master of suspence should be given the recognition it deserves.
1	Singing voice that mind gets warm: It is a famous piece of music collection which keeps being eternally heard.
0	ULTIMATE RIP-OFF: Do not purchase this download. Track15 has a serious glitch in it at about 2:30 seconds. It may well be in the master, too.
1	Great!: So many people have never taken him seriously. That's because they have no understanding of talent or superb craftsmanship. A great example is in the one star review below. Sigh. Making fun of him is pretty cliche. It went out of style 20 years ago. Maybe it's time the naysayers grew up a little. People might of made fun of him, but guess what?. 20 some years later and he is still here!. This CD debuted at number 3 on the charts in a world filled with Britneys and Limp Bizkits. Mr. Manilow has definitley gotten the last laugh. The detractors can laugh all you want, but it won't amount to a hill of beans. He proved himself decades and decades ago and is still doing it. Laughing at him is as meaningless as ever.
0	King of Kitsch: It is unfathomable that here, in the early days of the 21st century, there are still people who not only listen to the King of Kitsch, but will own up to it. There is a reason why Barry Manilow has spent the better part of a quarter of a century being the punchline of jokes and twenty of those reason can be found here. Sappy songs galore, almost all having the same "beautiful music" structure of slow tempo throughout each verse and chorus, before ending in a bombastic crescendo. Sadly these songs can still be heard in elevators and dentist offices across America. Even sadder is that people will pay to hear them again at home.
0	MANILOW A HUMPERDINCK WANT TO BE: MANILOW SHOULD JUST HANG IT UP.HE SHOULD GO BACK TO PERFORMING IN BATH HOUSES.BETWEEN A BIG NOSE AND A VERY AUDIBLE LISP THIS GUY CRUCIFIES THE MEANING OF ROMANTIC MUSIC.HE IS A ENGELBERT HUMPERDINCK WANNA BE.MAYBE HE CAN GET A GIG SHINING ENGELBERTS SHOES!IF HE IS LUCKY!
0	For Cultural Lemmings Everywhere: Please! Five stars for a collection of the sappiest songs of all time? It is pretty hard to take seriously someone who claims to have invented music ("I am music and I write the songs") yet the abundance of five star reviews here proves that PT Barnium was right....
1	AWESOME, AWESOME, AWESOME!!!!!: I was so excited when this finally arrived in the mail! I have been listening to it non stop... It certainly takes me back and reminds me of all of the good and special times in my life. This is a great CD with all of the songs you love to sing along with. Enjoy!
0	It's a shame cos it's a good movie..: ..between horror and deep emotions with a capital fault:What the hell they think they are in giving us a clear statement against euthanasia??? We are no longer in the middle age I thought.. Even for American standarts this should cause a big scandal!
0	Absolutely horrible: Absolutely horrible.1 star at best. What's there not to like? The acting is absolutely horrible. The special effects, especially the make-up, look amateur - the blood (and there is lots of it) looks very fake. Email me if you disagree. I hope I find a buyer for this DVD when I sell it on ebay...
0	Yawn!: I thought the plot really dragged in this sappy, semi-scary film about a young women who's frightened of hospitals, but has to go into one to rescue her husband. Of course, in conquering her fears she saves his life, blah, blah, blah. Her husband, meanwhile, discovers that four of the nurses are blood-drinking lesbians in one of the most blatantly stupid scenes in the entire film. Clearly, somebody on the production staff must have realized that this film was a dud and that perhaps by adding a completely unimaginative girl/girl/girl/girl encounter they could somehow save it. But alas, this film is one patient that was beyond saving.
0	Don't even bother - save your money: The DVD is a dissapointment. Over1/2 of the music footage is missing.It's a "tribute" concert, yet the biggest tribute to Freddie, Extremes medley of Queen songs (which is BY FAR the show stealer) and them performing "Love of my Life" w/ Brian May are stricken from the DVD.Do yourself a favor, hunt down the VHS copy. If you threw out your VCR, it's worth buying another one to watch it with.
1	Great Concert: hearing George Michael do SOmebody to Love was a great Moment on this set.ELton John&Axel ROse Dueting was something special as well.it was a great tribute.Seal,Annie Lennox,Bowie,ETC.. made this a Special COncert.
1	Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert: An awesome concert of superstars as a tribute to one of the greatest vocalist of all time. I still have the original VHS tape and love it. This DVD (finally) is a must for all the fans of Queen and Rock & Roll music.
0	Smells nice, doesn't last: Smells great...doesn't last that long. Thought it was me, asked others...they all agreed. We couldn't smell anything after a couple of hours. What a waste of money.
1	Loves kitty: We started using this gym when our son was 2 months old. He absolutely loved it. Every time we spun the ball and the cat made music our son went crazy with glee. He is now 41/2 months old and he still likes it, but he does seem to get bored with it quicker and he likes his larger play mat better.
0	boring...: Thought that this was very cute and had many things to do however I think it looks better than it actually is. My daughter really could have cared less about the entire thing. There really is only 4 things hanging down and they really don't go OVER the baby. I think that the entire point of a baby gym is to have the toys over the baby to reach out a grab. This is a total miss.
0	Do yourself a favour, do NOT buy this book!: Note the worst book in the world, but fairly darn close. I bought three study guides for this exam and the only one that seemed to be helpful was the Coriolis Exam Prep by Talbert. It got a bit detailed in parts but was the clear winner of the three I read.
1	great scary movie from wes craven!: I find this movie very well done, it has a lot of scenes that would probably at least make you a little bit scared. This film has good acting by Heather Langenkamp(Nancy Thomson) and Johnny Depp(Glenn) and by Robert Englund(freddy). If you are in the mood to watch a horror film then this is one film that you should not miss
1	Iconic slasher flick: This is it. The film that introduced the world to Horror icon Freddy Krueger. Of course Freddy wasn't the ONLY slasher in the '80s (with Michael Meyers and Jason Voorhees), but to me, Freddy is the absolute best! There are plenty of moments that'll make you jump out of your seat and there are also some just plain downright disturbing moments. If you're a fan of slasher flicks then this movie is definitely a must-see!5 stars/5
1	One of the best horror movies of all time: Fred Krueger, a psychotic child murderer that was torched in his boiler room by the enraged parents of elm street. Ten years later he returns and this time he slashes kids in their dreams. This movie is fun and entertaining, no doubt Wes Craven's best movie. Unfortunately it had to be followed by a couple of try hard sequels.
1	The beginning of your nightmares!: This is the first Nightmare on Elm Street and it rocks! How many people out there have been scared by Freddy? Millions! In the movie Freddy attacks you in your dreams, and he makes your life miserable. I first watched this movie when I was seven and it scared the living daylight out of me! Ofcourse going to sleep is hard after you watch this movie cause you think Freddy is after you, and he is.... nah, Im just kidding. So anyways, if you want to enjoy a good movie, A Nightmare on Elm Street is the one, I mean, look at all the sequels it has, its a great flick!
1	SENUOUS AND SENATIONAL FROM START TO FINISH: I LOVE THIS MAN AND HIS WAY WITH A SONG. SMOOTH AND FLUID; FILLED WITH PASSIONATE AND POETIC LYRICS.LISTEN TO "BUT BEAUTIFUL", THE CLASSIC JOHNNY BURKE BALLAD. IT LEAVES A LUMP IN THE THROAT.LUCIEN TAKES HIS TIME AND IT'S A PLEASURE!
1	Very Interesting View of The Future: I really liked this book, although there were some parts to it that I didn`t understand. The author creates a future world, where humans are genetically engineered to "be happy". I think the idea behind this book is to point out some of the weaknesses of our society (eg. our reluctance to face our problems - we tend to take some "soma" instead, which is a widely used drug in the book to make people forget their problems)and to make us aware of what could happen in the future to humanity if we aren`t careful. The future described in the novel is very realistic and some of it is already starting to show up - whether we like it or not. When reading the book, you get the feeling (or maybe you don`t) that something is wrong with this future world. Engineering people to work and be happy is wrong, because the happiness they are feeling is not real. I guess it doesn`t make any sense now, but after reading the book it gives you something to think about. A great book!
0	Hmm...: I don't get it. It's very unusual. Controversial in its time, but still widely read throughout schools in the United States. I must say it wasn't all bad, the ideas he portrayed were revolutionary and original, although I was extremely let down at the end. It is clever that drugs aren't for pleasure anymore, they are everyday, for the use of increasing entertainment. That's how someone explained their interpretation, but I still [dislike] my English teacher for making me read it. It just seemed as if I was being led to believe one thing throughout, expecting some kind of epiphany, but got a guy walking in circles at the top of the stairs...
0	I expected so much more from such a high-rated novel: I was so enthusiastic and worked up to expecting a splendid and original read, but came off greatly dissapointed and got frustrated trying to think of what all the hype was about with BRAVE NEW WORLD. I tried so very hard to like and enjoy reading this...but my mind just didn't want to cooperate. Such a complex and creepy look into a superfical world into this book was hard to grasp, this just wasn't the type of book I expected. I prefered1984 and Animal Farm much more than Brave New World. I mean, it's hard to say that emotions can errupture with just a little pill, and vice versa. Oh well, maybe I'm a bit tuff to give such a beloved classic just1 star, but that's what I deeply and truely think this book deserves. I'll stick to my old favorites: Eliot, Hardy, Orwell, Willa Cather, Wharton, Dreiser, and Gustave Flaubert. Hehe, I never get to tired of my favorites. Viz., I didn't like this classic.
0	The ultimate in idiocy: A world where nobody is unhappy... this is supposed to be a bad thing in Huxley's story. What nonsense.I find it strange that Huxley supposedly had any affinity towards buddhism... The ultimate goal in buddhism is the ending of suffering... other things... freedom, love etc... are unimportant next to this. To say that you want to "keep the right to be unhappy" (as one of the characters in the book says) is the most unbuddhist thing anyone could say...What stupidity... taking pride in your ability to be unhappy...
0	Doesn't fulfil even the lowest requirements for fiction: I don't understand why Mr. Huxley is so famous. Okay, he has a very strong message, but then, his writing skills are non-existent. This book completely lacks fantasy and originality. As a result, the possible appeal of Mr. Huxley's ideas is overweighed in a hundredfold by the despise his "prose" (sorry for using this word here!) makes you feel. How is one supposed to enjoy the beauty of a wonderful landscape by a scribble of a three-year-old? Instead of this "novel", Mr. Huxley should have written a short newspaper article titled "Things I Don't Like".If Mr. Huxley is a writer, anybody who talks is a linguist. Reading this book leaves one perplexed - how could the author voluntarily expose himself to such ridicule?
1	into medialis they do go, yes: there were corollary tendency. without sshining light the new generation do you? uh?
1	Great Classic: This book is a great classic of Sci-Fi, couldn't put it down read it in two days and was very engaging.
0	Not all it's cracked up to be: Brave New World has many thought-provoking ideas. To dream up an utopia in Huxley's time is genious, but the story is not. I read this story for eighth grade, and though it had some things that i'm sure no one had ever thought of before then, they have now. It's not good enough to have a good ides, you have to write well, too.
1	Pleasently Surprised: I picked this book up at a rummage sale to add to my little library of books. I didn't plan on reading it for quite awhile... until I learned that this book was banned when it was first published in1932. This is scifi at it's best. There is a lot of scientific information, but not so much that the reader has to re-read every single paragraph to figure things out. There is a very easy to follow story with some great turns, interesting characters, and a picture that is built for the mind to see. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone under17 due to the sexual nature of the book, but I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a really interesting read.
0	1984 was much more enjoyable...: A decent book, but compared to1984, this book was not that good. Orwell's1984 was much more enjoyable to read whereas, at times, I felt lost with Brave New World. The line between protagonist and antagonist seemed blurred throughout this book until the end. Perhaps I should read it again to better understand the plot, but overall, I thought1984 was a better read.
0	open your eyes, read it, THEN THROW IT AWAY: BNW a novel with many labels: utopian, dystopian, sci fi, a metaphor of the present, a warning of the future, a great book, a companion to1984...I only half read it in high school. I don't think it should be part of standard curriculum, just as I don't think Fahrenheit 451 should be. Huxley and Bradbury's bursting desire to make the world aware of the disorienting menace of media and information control is wasted on adolescents.The book IS thought-provoking, though I wish it had been a short story. As such it would never as been as popular: the characters ARE interesting, but Huxley relies upon THEM to explain everything. The only descriptions are left to them, and as storytellers, they all fall far short of extraordinary.This is not a world I would want to live in.And1984 is better written.
1	Best Negative Utopia I've read (And Yes I read1984): I have to say right off the bat that this is one of the greatest books I ever read. Everyone already commented on the glimpse of the future...chilling totalitarianism, yada yada yada...I'd love to give you a complete analysis of the book, but it's10:30 and I'm tired. THe story is thourougly engaging, kept me enticed until the end...kind of expected it, but in another sense it cought me completely off guard...it was a masterpiece...better than1984, which, while quite cool, struck the reviewer(I have to refer to myself in the third person once per review...it's policy :)) as a bit dry and tedious.
1	An ominous warning of a possible future. A must read!: Aldous Huxley grips the mind, and keeps you locked to this book as he describes a future, one which is completely homogenius and conformed. Practices like artificial conception and genetic tampering are the standard in this uniform society, where very few choices are allowed, and questions are rarely heard. Huxley skillfully describes this gloomy premonition in incredible detail, and in many instances, including artificial insemination and genetic altering, he predicted the actual future. If it does nothing else, this book should send an ominous signal to today's society.This book is a must read!<BR
1	Fantastic light: I bought this for my husband for Christmas and he thinks it's the best headlamp he's ever used. He's amazed at the long battery life and the bright lite. We live in the Cascades and he uses it all the time either for work or even to get firewood at night.
1	Great reliable headlight!: I have used this headlight for weeks now in hunting and camp situations and found it to be exactly as advertised.It is very good quality and the run time is nice. I use it mostly on low and it lasts very well with the 2-AAA batteries it uses which by the way are another reason I tried this in the first place because AAA are common and available as well as cheap to use. The Enduro is awesome for the price and the high setting is pretty good for about anything within reason for a light of this caliber. I can't speak of its waterproof design but it looks like it will take a drenching with no problem with the oring seal it has in the battery compartment cap.You can't go wrong for the money.
1	good light: Super light, cant even feel it on your head. also good because you can clip it to your hat too. 2aa batteries, better than most compact lights which require 3aa. bright enough to do any working task. highly recommend it.
1	Good book for beginners: The book raises a lot of issues that need to be dealt with in designing a web site. This is not a book on how to create a web page. A lot of the material in the book is common sense, but good as a refresher. The book is well written and easy to read.
0	Slow and obvious: This book may be OK if you've just been put in charge of an intranet and have never used the web before. If you have spent more than a week surfing the internet in your life, you will feel, as I did, that this book states and restates the blindingly obvious ad nauseum. I actually failed to finish this book, I found it so terribly dry and unenlightening. Another thing that really bugs me about it is that the authors pose question after question, but never really supply an answer. Sometimes they make tentative suggestions that this-may-work-then, but never many good examples. They also reference screenshots of one little area of a given website, but this doesn't work because (if you believe the basic premise of the book) a website is a coherent item, not a distinct set of pages. Therefore highlighting specific elements of a website out of context is meaningless. Better spend your time surfing the web and thinking for yourself why some sites work and some don't.
0	Waste if time; waste of money: I should start by saying I didn't read the whole book. That's because I found it insulting that we were to believe this was a true biography. I resented the author passing off what he thought Gene Kelly must have been thinking during the AFI awards, I disliked the author painting Gene Kelly as mean-spirited and shallow. It was maddening to have the beginning of every chapter fractured with this conjecture. I considered this a total waste of money. Although I freely share my books with others, this book has been consigned to the role of doorstop.
1	Great country/rock: Excellent product with great vocals. We do a fast line dance to "Dance". Great CD with lots to like!
1	Good, Quality Cable: I have used this cable for a few years for recording my Casio electronic piano onto my computer and I love it. Once you set it up for the first time, it is quick and easy to use with a nice sound quality.
1	Every Christian should read this book!: The church has not acted with love toward the Jewish people. This book explains why we, as Christians, should be more appreciate of them and why we owe them a debt of gratitude. Be prepared to learn a lot!
1	Babylon & Ting: OK, so everyone already knows the reputation that this early orb effort carries, tracks such as OOBE and Blue Room are widely recognised as chill-dub classics. The fact is that this album is the epitomy of what makes the orb, the orb....The songs are long and consist of layoured soundscape backdrops for dub rhythms and drifting samples. This album is an extremely accomplished work, which changes tempo, style and even volume with no flaw as you move through the tracks.Blue Room is a favourite track of mine and I wish I had the single, Wobbles bassline adds to the track immensely. Towers of Dub follows it and gives the listener an insight into the orb's sense of humour (you need to have seen Victor Lewis-Smith's TV work) which is black at the best.If you have [the money] in your pocket and your in a music store knowing that this is the only album you will ever buy, go on - endulge me and try this.
1	Space Dub: This is it - the "Blue Room" space-ambient extravanganza from the Orb. Great free-ranging basslines traverse the unknown while little voices whisper in our ears. The second CD contains several outstanding "Blue Room" versions. SO sweet.
0	Boring, but not the worst in the series: If you're a fan of the NOES series, you'll probably end up seeing this one, but let me tell you, it's the same plot they've been using since the original. It's sad. To the point: to rate this movie is hard, but all you have to do is compare it to the rest of the series, and compared to #5: The Dream Child, it's way better. Don't be fooled, this is still a real bore!
1	PURE EVIL NEVER REALLY DIES!: Proving there's no rest for the wicked,the unspeakable,evil Freddy Krueger(RobertEnglund)is again resurrected from the grave to wreak havoc upon those who dare to dream.But this time,he faces a powerful new adversary!As her friends succumb one by one to Freddy's wrath,telephathically gifted Kristen(TuesdayKnight) embarks on a desperate mission to destroy the dream stalker and release the souls of his victms once and for all.After Kristen gets killed her friend Alice(LisaWilcox)is the world's only hope.Alice now has Kristen's powers she is a DREAM MASTER.After Alice's friends start to die including her older brother,Alice prepares to fight the deadly killer for the last time.After Alice kills Freddy she goes home to her boyfriend. But is he really dead?WELCOME TO WONDERLAND ALICE! Rated R brief nudity,violence,and language.
0	Not easy to dance to: I was so disappointed with this dance video! It is so confusing and not fun at all. She will say in the video now go to your right and she is going left and I don't know which way to go. When she says dance to the left she is going to the right. They should have done this video in front of a mirror. Big disappointment.
0	garden gnome: A real let down the pictures look so good, but in reality they are very small and get lost outdoors in a garden setting, the plants overwhelm them, good price but they are not very practical
0	Only the obvious copied and pasted: This book I found rather disappointing. It is DEFINITELY for the beginner. So much that most information is nearly copied from all the help information provided during the installation process itself.If you are a beginner I would not recommend buying this book. Look for something else!!
0	Penelope lays an egg: Fans of the original Hal Roach series should be outraged at this piece of junk, which is highly overrated at even one star. The cast of look-alike children are completely devoid of talent, the script is wretched, and the direction is even worse. P.U.!!
1	A great movie for kids: The Little Rascals (1994), *****, starring Travis Tedford, Kevin Jamal Woods, Jordan Warkol, Zachary Mabry, Ross Bagley.I first saw this movie on the exclusive Starz On Demand service that came with Comcast Cable. I love the Little Rascals and that is my main reason for watching it again and again. In the movie, I love how there's every main movie genre--excluding science-fiction and fantasy and animation. There's romance when Alfalfa (Bug Hall) woos his words of love to his young soulmate Darla (Brittany Ashton Holmes). There's drama when Waldo interferes in the budding, inseparable relationship between Alfalfa and Darla. There's comedy when Alfalfa goes about half-naked when he undresses from the ballerina costume and when Butch (Sam Saletta) and Woim (Blake Jeremy Collins). There's plenty of action during the cross-city go-kart race. That's the best part of the whole movie. I recommend this film for male and female, young and old. There's everything for everybody.
1	Best Kids Move Ever: I've never seen any child who didn't want to watch this move at least twice if not three times.
0	disappointed: I was extremely disappointed and caught very off guard by this book. I completed this book with a women's group and couldn't believe the point of view. I felt like the book expected and told women that they should be "June Cleaver". Very disappointed in the message that women should have no say so in anything and just fall to the feet of their man. Also, I did not understand how this book's message was in any way the message given in the bible as to what a wife should strive to be.
0	Very statistical: I was kind of dissapointed with this material. It only talks about statistics... more like a thesis or something...Was hoping something more conductual-psychological oriented.
0	Be A Doormat For A Man's Ego: The entire book was about stroking a man's ego at the expense of anything the woman may want.You have to submitt yourself towalking on eggs in order to keep his ego full of pride.Isn'tpride a sin? This book is not helpful,the book will cause thewoman to second guess herself.
1	So interesting!: This has been a very interesting read. I purchased it because I just started dating again after 27 years of marriage and the death of my hubby. I have 3 boys and lots of men in my life and never knew some of the things I learned here! I suggest this for all women.
1	fun: nothing but fun freddys one libners genious his kills bizzre gross and inhuman the actings great aspecialy by alice freddy and her frien yolonda.
0	And they continued the series because why?: Nightmare on Elm Street, A: The Dream Child (1989) Robert England, Lisa Wilcox, Erika Anderson, Valorie Armstrong, Michael Ashton, Kelly Jo Minter, Whitby Hertford, Danny Hassel, Beatrice Boepple, D: Stephen Hopkins.In the fifth installment, the nightmarish dream-stalker Freddy enters the dreams of survivor Wilcox's unborn child, attempting to place the souls of those he killed into the fetus, and enjoys his favorite pastime by going after her friends. Again, bizarre effects are the only pro here, but the movie's a bust. They saved the worst for last, but it's followed by FREDDY'S DEAD: THE FINAL NIGHTMARE.Running Time: 89 minutes and rated R for language and gore/violence.
0	Nightmare on Elm Street 5: The Dream Child: The second to worst film in the series. Not that good. Kind of boring with hardly any death scenes or comedy. Starring: Robert Englund, Lisa Wilcox, Danny Hassel, Erika Anderson and Kelly Jo Minter.
0	The new Vhs and Dvd version is terrible: This version of Nightmare on Elm Street is so terrible.Where's the special features at either on this new Vhs or Dvd there's no deleted scenes like the uncut vhs version.Dan's motorcycle scene was more graphic his face was ripped off and a needle stabs his abck,and Greta's death was longer Freddy cuts her stomach and feeds her own livers.There should be a new Vhs or Dvd version of the uncut version.
0	A sore dissapointment: Freddy [Robert Englund] returns to haunt alice [Lisa Wilcox] and her friends once more. But this time, Alice is pregnant with a boy and Freddy is using her unborn son to haunt her. As this is all going on, Freddy continues his rampage on those around her and it's again up to Alice to find a way to stop Freddy. This is one of the worst movies in the series [Behind only Nightmare 2], Mainly because of the weak storyline. There is, However, A rather insightful subplot which involves Freddy's mother, Amanda Krueger. The film's gothic tone could've been very beneficial to this film [If it only went with a better story!]. The acting is bad and the movie seems as if it has no genuine thrills to offer and therefore, It runs out of steam very quickly. If you want a good Freddy movie, Look elsewhere! Followed by Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare.
0	who could expect anything from this mess?: this, like the entire nightmare on elm street is another dull, silly and boring excuse for a movie. No one should expect anything but boredom from this.
1	good read about write: There are many good photographs and tasty tidbits in this fascinating glance at the writing inspirations behind our favorite songs. A little of it must necessarily be speculation, but it is thoroughly researched. One question: where did he get the drawing that inspired "Lucy In The Sky..," and is it authentic? He doesn't give a source.
1	Love this film--and the blu-ray looks spectacular.: One of my top ten favorite films, Polanski and the spot-on cast made one for the ages with this one...and I was really knocked out at how good the new HD version looked. Really wonderful to see a film of this age look like it was shot yesterday...Now I just want "The Last Picture Show" to get the same treatment, and I'll be happy :)
1	As Close to Perfect Film Noir as one can get: Early Jack Nicholson is edgy and powerful, and Faye Dunaway is an absolutely superb emotional wreck, in this examination of evil, and the limits to our ability to combat it. The surprise climax is very, very powerful.
0	Fine performances, but...: Watchable for the performances, but wildly overrated, as is nearly every Polanski film. "LA Confidential" probably could not exist if "Chinatown" hadn't, but the truth is "Confidentail" is everything this film isn't. Now if we could have just time-morphed Nicholson and Dunaway into "Confidential..."
1	Great job again Anchor Bay!!! This 4-DVD Gallagher Set rules!!!: Great job Anchor Bay Entertainment!!! This great 4 DVD set includes14 great Gallagher shows,very funny stuff indeed,Gallagher is a very unique and one of a kind comedian!!! So if you love Gallagher,this set is quite a bargain,the animated slipcover is also very cool,when you open it up a cardboard Gallagher smashes a cardboard watermelon,sort of like a kids pop up book!!! It's Sledge-O-Matic!!! Two thumbs up!!! Five stars!!! A+
1	tops: We have had a cake pan like this for over 38 years and everytime we use it my husband always said he wanted another. So, when I found this I COULDN'T WAITE TO ORDER IT. It's great for holding bar-b-que meat in as will as baking. And with the metal lid you can stack other dishes on top in the frig.
1	great: I had been looking for a cake pan with a metal lid for awhile to replace my old one... this is so great I ended up buying 3 and giving them away....you won't go wrong buying this..
1	Exactly that "An American Coup": Really gives good insight on what really happened as opposed to what we were told on that fateful day. You may believe all, some, or maybe none at all but it gives you a lot to think about. Fascinating.
0	Add us to the negative list.: When we rented it, we believed the people who had given 5 stars. After viewing,1 star is stretching it. I won't repeat, just read the1 star reviews and believe.
0	stupid people who only listen to those that agree: These Idiots wouldn't know a conspiracy if it were to kill them personally. The only thing this movie shows is how easily led some people are. If it were possible to give0 stars, I would.
0	Loose brains: Watch the documentary that was aired on the National Geo or Discovery channel of experts looking into the claims made in this video and they explain it all and conclude that the planes brought it down. But you arm-chair experts know more, bull crap.The floors of the towers were made of concrete, which were VERY heavy, just a few weakened steal beams as seen on the news is all it would take. The weight of the upper floors on those beams caused the upper floors to come crashing down upon the floor that was hit and caused a domino effect of ever increasing weight that just smashed the towers.Use some brains people.
1	Better than I thought: I watched this a couple of days ago. It was funny, and a bit on the "creppy" side, but it was great. I'm glad I took the advise and watched it. Existential crisis at its best!
0	Even the lead actress couldn't figure out this movie: Unique beauty Emmanuelle Devos led me here (seeRead My Lipsto understand why), but 'La Moustache' is a hard movie to like despite another winning performance by this beguiling actress. While suspenseful, the movie is ultimately infuriating because like another recent French release,Cache (Hidden), not only is the viewer unable to figure it out, turns out the actors are unclear on the concept as well. Indeed, in the "Making Of" featurette included on the DVD, Ms. Devos literally shrugs her shoulders and admits to giving up on figuring out the movie and simply focusing on her role. Moreover, director Emmanuel Carrère and writer Jérme Beaujour tell featurette viewers that they reviewed the first cut of the film and realized that they needed to chop out the explanatory scene (hopefully the one that lets on whether it's the wife or the husband that's gone off the deep end). Maddening.
0	An exercise in futility.: This film is like two films in one. The first half of the movie (in France) is wonderfully taut and suspenseful. We wonder about the motives of the characters. The second half (in Macau) is filmed like an amateurish indy film. The ending is a frustrating exercise in disappointment and need to be explained away only by watching the interview with the director (on the DVD). I borrowed the book to compare the endings and think the book ties up the loose ends better. All in all a rather frustrating and meaningless movie after the suspense in the beginning.
1	Another good Ahern story: I have liked Aherns characters every since his survivor series. The series also has some good characters and action. Kind of a fun read.
1	Freaks: Even people jaded by the extreme "realism" of the 21st century will be shocked by this one. I don't think any mainstream film maker today would have the guts to film this without some sort of political or socially correct manipulation. The story itself is rather pedestrian - opportunistic beauty takes advantage of besotted midget, and runs afoul of his friends. The action takes place in an old time circus, complete with the freaks that are no longer de riguer. The shocker is that few special effects are used, and the freaks are played by themselves. The result is a film with less of the 30s Hollywood melodrama, and a more realistic portrait of people who are physically different - some tragically disfigured. I found the experience moving and harrowing at the same time.
0	Good music: It was a great DVD. But I did realize it was a DVD. I wanted a CD. It would have been nice if it came with both
0	Damaged goods... Pay attention to vendor name.: The item was damaged, and previously a returned item. Half of the wire top was not attached.Guessing from the vendor name and the fact that this was a previously opened item, I believe it was a defective item. The vendor is less than scrupleous to send defective items... fool me once... never again!
1	Excellent guidebook for visitors to the Old City: If you have the time needed to follow the guidance in this book, you will find it to be a most worthwhile purchase. Although several years old, it's still new enough to lead the way through the various revelations that one can find in the Old City of Jerusalem.
1	The Consummate Traveller: Just when I think I've written a great travel story, I go read Palin and remind myself how it's done. I just love his incredibly obtuse descriptions and attention to unimportant detail. To read this, or any of his books, is to travel side-by-side with Palin as if a companion. I raise my glass to you.
1	Must see for fans of traveling shows: Michael Palin provides an offbeat and interesting documentary of his trip from the North Pole to the South Pole. This video makes you wish you could have gone with him!
1	sucked in.: I found this book to be one of the best in the Anita Blake series. For me, it started off a bit slow but quickly sucked me in. I don't want to give up any details, but the wonderful detail of the 'fight' scenes, the tension between Anita and Jean-Claude, and everything in between makes this out to be a very good read.
1	Circus of the Damned: If you loved Ann Rice you will love laurell Hamilton. Read thenm in order, this one is #3.
0	The Decline of Our Gang: Do not confuse the 52 Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer shorts with the classic comedies produced by Hal Roach Studios. When Roach sold Our Gang to MGM in1938, the creative spark quickly diminished until the series became unwatchable. Apart from the initial1938-39 shorts (highlighted by "The Little Ranger," "Aladdin's Lantern," "Men in Fright" and "Alfalfa's Aunt"), these one-reel travesties lack the charm and spontaneity of the Roach efforts. Spanky, Buckwheat and the gang were badly served by MGM's joyless, heavy-handed approach. On the plus side, the DVD set features excellent and uncut 35mm prints - which cannot be said for the sloppy RHI/Genius "Little Rascals" collection.
0	Our Gang + MGM = Bad Comedy: I'm amazed at the reviewers who have given this Our Gang DVD collection five stars. We're talking Spanky and Company at their worst! The first half-dozen shorts from1938 are OK, then MGM trashes the series beyond recognition. Though Hal Roach stopped producing comedy shorts for economic reasons, it must have pained him to see what Leo the Lion did to his beloved property. If you are truly an Our Gang completist, then consider Roach's "Hide and Shriek" the grand finale.
1	One hell of a businessman: Schwensen's business-like nature is sometimes annoying. He name-drops a lot and fawns over the genius of Carrot Top, offering as evidence of his creativity the fact that he makes money. But if you can supply the artistry, Schwensen definately knows the business. He has a lot of direct, useful information about how to market your act at all levels of competition, from novices to headliners.
0	This is what killed my ear for music.: Not trying to piss anyone off, this is my personal opinion after years of torture with this music. I HATE THIS CD AND STILL HOLD A GRUDGE AGAINST MY MOM FOR MAKING ME LISTEN TO THIS GARBAGE! Its not that I hate folk music, I love folk music (I love all music) and lovely people like Judy Collins and even early stuff by the seegers but half of these songs are off key and its twangy and horrible training for any young ear. Let your kids listen to real music please and not stupid kiddy versions that if they have any intelligence they will know are beneath them. You aren't doing your children any favors by buying them this crap. I'm sure there's some redeeming value because some people like this but I just cannot see it.
1	I love this: I love this. My children have all loved it. It's just great, authentic folk music, easy to listen to, easy to sing, easy to apply to whatever you might be doing. The way folk music ought to be.
1	Good Book for Experienced Test Takers: Buy this book if you already have substantial experience with NT4 and Windows 2000 and you need help passing the MS tests. I passed the monster 70-240 with this book. The "On the Exam" tips were especially helpful. Also, the "In the Real World" comments were very entertaining.
1	Antidote for a bad mood: Natalie MacMaster's music will lift your spirits any time, but don't miss a chance to see her perform onstage. She is a terrific entertainer as well as a masterful musician.
0	"The Reaping" should have been called "The Sleeping"...: because that was what I was doing after a few minutes of watching this Cardinal Sin being called a movie.If at confession you're given penance by your priest to do a thousand "Our Fathers" or to say the Rosary a hundred times, then count your blessings that he didn't force you to watch this movie just one time. Perhaps there truly is a place called Hell, because I felt like I was there for an hour and a half.This movie could have been so great, given the genesis of the story and staring Hilary Swank, one of the best actresses of our day, but it ended up being a complete mess. Even the quality of the blu-ray transfer was terrible.Please save your $19, or go buy "Seven" (which deals with this genera brilliantly), "28 Days Later", "28 Weeks Later", or "The Skeleton Key", which are all far superior films that you will enjoy time and time again.Happy movie watching :)
0	Of Interest to Preteen Girls: Oh, how Jane Eyre was such a boring read! But, of course, I've never been a little girl, the target audience for this story. It reads like a diary, without the "Dear diary, ..." part a nd covers Jane's life - as imagined by young Charlotte. I only read it for a literature class.
1	Excellent rendition: Amanda Root does an excellent job of bringing the story to life. She seems to truly understand the message Charlotte Bronte communicates in her superb dialogue. This is my favorite audio CD. Amanda Root's telling of the story does not sound like someone reading from a book, but rather like someone living a life. I highly recommend this audio book.
0	What a piece of crap: The only thing less exciting than this book would be watching paint dry.Stuffy english characters abound in this failed attempt to be Dickens-esque.
1	The best book I have ever read!: I am only12 years old but at least read a book a week. When i first picked up this book i felt i would not beable to finish it because of my ablity to get bored really quick. I started reading it and couldn't put it down. I got in trouble in 2 classes because i had been reading it under my desk until i reached a point (which was very rare) that i could put it down. I love Jane Eyre's way of thinking and how she trys to make her life as full as possible. I would recomend this to everyone! I keep on going back in the book to a part i liked best or a place in the story that captivates me. It seems i will never grow tired of this book. I hope all that have read it feel the same!
1	My All-Time Favorite Book: Jane Eyre is a wonderful masterpiece! I absolutely love it. The characters are so well drawn that you become one with Jane and everything she feels and endures. Mr. Rochester has to be the greatest male figure in literature! Move over Heathcliff! I got goosebumps by the end of the book and wanted to immedietly flip it over and begin again.
1	The best book I'll ever read!: This book is a wonderful story. It is a real page-turner. I couldn't put it down. Charlotte Bronte does awesome discriptions. I recomend this book to everyone who likes most classics. I wish people still wrote books this good. I guess you could call this book a trying-to-find-your-place-in-the-world story. Jane is totally amazing! Even if I am only11, I can understand what Ms. Bronte is talking about.
1	You'll either love it or hate it,: I was given this boom to read over the summer for school. I saw how thick it was and I thought oh-mi-god!! I read the first 2 chapters and could not get into it. But by the time I reached chapter 5 I couldn't put it down.It's one of those books you'll either love or hate.
1	Jane Eyre: This book is a wonderful book, but it drags quite a lot. Half of the book is Jane rambling on about Mr. Rochester. This book is very religious (this i don't mind) and Jane rambles on about this later on in the book. Nonetheless, the book was great. It had a many twists and turns. Yet it ticked me off that it all fell into place all of a sudden, for it dragged the conflicts. The book brings up Jane from a young girl of 8 to a woman of19. This book would bring tears to your eyes. Don't get deceived by the first150 pages. It is not all dull dull dull. The plot builds up like a snail crawling on grass but then at the top it falls like a roller-coaster. I do praise Charlotte for this work of art. It is as sweet as can be though I am not for romances.
1	A "Regular People" Review: OK, I'm no smarter than you are, and I read Jane Eyre and thought it was great. The book has so many themes to it, its not just about love, or money, or whatever- a lot of things are touched on. The main character is someone you'll never forget, just as I write this I'm mentally going over the book and I have that warm feeling in my stomach, thats how I know its a great book, so read it..... and keep me updated!
1	Jane Arrogant: Jane Eyre, a woman with courage, with passion, with determination, demonstrates a remarkable amount of pride while she lives her life. Her mixed life mingles between feeling sorry for her orphaned self and trying to be a romantic wife to Mr. Rochester. The novel, Jane Eyre, is an excellent work of Charlotte Bront not only because of the work itself, but because it is a relation to herself as an autobiography. Charlotte Bront was not that much different than the main character, Jane Eyre, in that they both lived without parents and they both know what loss can be like. The book flows eloquently from start to finish and contains many life morals concerning pride, love, and what it takes to live in this world. Jane Eyre shows how one can mature in to the person that they will be for the rest of their life. Because of this book, my life has been enlightened with good morals and I would recommend this book to anyone and everyone.
1	Wonderful!: The introduction includes a dedication and thanks to William Makepeace Thackery, author of Vanity Fair. Bronte and Thackery both admired the enormous capability of women even if not recognized by nineteenth century society. Jane Eyre, and Becky Sharp of Vanity Fair, are both strong women but in different ways. Jane is selfless, innocent, filled with love and yet heroic. Becky uses people. And she outwits nearly everyone. While they are different types of people, both are strong women who take the initiative.Jane Eyre exposes the narrow mind of the dogmatic evangelical. He wishes to serve God. However he doesn't care much for people. On the other hand, Jane in her own loving and simple way, seems to be a much better person. She reminds me of Dorthea of Middlemarch.This wonderful book should be read by one and all!
1	Beautiful classic!: I just finished reading this for the first time. I'm so happy I did. It's a great read, albeit a long read but worth the time spent.
0	Jane Eyre review: It was boring and filled with doodoo and i didnt like it at all and it sucks and i hate jane
0	cheap paperback: Classic novel, great price but the print is from the top to bottom of page and very unappealing to read!
1	My favorite book!: I am14 and I love this book!!!! I have read it 2 times and could read it again. This book is my favorite book ever, it held my attention all the way through(unlike the Jane Austin books which I like, but take a while to get instering). This is definalty the best romance I have ever read! Let me finish by saying I read it once as soon as i finished I was like man I should read it again, not much latter I was going for a long car ride so I did, and as soon as I finished it I thought the same thing, and I would have but my grandma wanted to read it(and this is such a great book that I had to let her read it beacuse everyone at least once should read it). One more thing I cried reading this book(add this to my list of books that make me cry: Marley and Me, The Return of the King, and now Jane Eyre).
0	The most BORING book in the world!: I am writing this because I just had to read the book as a requirement for English. It is the worst book in the world, and it drags on and on and on. I definitely would not recommend this book for anyone who likes action, mystery, or high paced books. If you want to be bored out of your mind, sure, go ahead and read it. Don't say I didn't warn you! If you ask me, sparknotes are the best thing for this book.
1	Jane Eyre: Enjoyable read! Did not read this while growing up, I thoroughly enjoyed the writing as well as the story. Refreshing!
1	Jane Eyre Still on Top: I loved Jane Eyre in high school and I still do now.The heaviness of the Victoria description, while way too heavy for me in books such as The Scarlett Letter, were much more comprehensible and approachable in Jane Eyre. I loved the character development in the book. And the story line of course, from rags to riches, had you rooting for Jane all the way. Adversity turns aside and she lives out her life in happiness and love. A wonderful story!
1	It made me love to read!: I've never been a reader but I joined a book club and this was the book of the month. I was very sure that I would never be able to read one of the classics and that I would be bored to tears. To my delight and surprise, this novel far surpassed any expectations I ever had. I was hooked from the beginning and looked for any opportunity to get away to read the book. It is not a fast read as the language was a big difficult at times but I learned to overlook the things that weren't so important to me and get on with the story. I have read two more classics since this novel and although Jane Eyre was my favorite, I am now a full fledged reading junkie.
1	A Bront Sister's Masterpiece: When I was looking through the books at the High School Library, the librarian, Ms. Pimentel, asked me if I was looking for anything in particular. I replied that I was not and she said to me, "Every girl from the age of nine and up should read Jane Eyre." I asked her to show me where the book was. It looked terribly boring but I wasn't about to say, "I'm not interested." So I took it. That night, I read through half of it. I couldn't help it--I was not able to put it down! What would happen to Jane next? Questions would race through my head and so I wouldanswer them myself by continuing to read. I finished it the next night. Ms. Pimentel was right. Every girl SHOULD read Jane Eyre.
0	Slow moving, feminist book.: I thought this was one of the slowest moving books I have ever read. Mainly focused on "romance" and unappearant drama. The ending to this book is also very predictable, I won't say it here because that will give it away. If this book had an unknown date and author I'd of thought it was another one of those trashy "love" novels written by Danielle Steel. Pure crap. The only reason I can find that this novel my even be remotely considered a classic is because it was written by a woman and it is Victorian.
1	Jane Eyre: I was missing out by skipping the end.: I tried to read Jane Erye in college, but I didn't budget my time well and didn't get to the end of the book before I had to take the test over it. Needless to say, I never finished it. Then a few years ago I read Jasper Fforde's hilarious book, The Eyre Affair, which uses Jane Eyre as a backdrop, and I decided to pick up the book again.When I began reading, I got frustrated with the excessive description and the unlikable characters at the beginning of the book. But I pushed through, and by the time I was half finished, I couldn't put the book down. On the surface Jane Eyre is a compelling love story, but underneath it is a heavy handed take on the scripture "if your right hand causes you to sin, then cut it off. And if your eye causes you to sin, then gouge it out." Despite the excessive description of trees and sunsets, Jane Eyre gives readers much to think about.
1	A job well done: This book is one of or the best that I have read in a long time. The writer of the book did an excellent job creating and evoking a variety of feelings within me. I am glad I read this book and I hope you will be too.
1	Good, solid copy: Jane Eyre is my very favorite book, and this is the copy I'll pass down to my grandchildren. It's aesthetically pleasing, and I'm sure it will hold together for many years. No arguing over the price, either. Thank you, B&N!
1	A Great Edition of a Classic Novel: If you are a Jane Eyre fan, junkie, or a first time reader, this is a wonderful edition to pick up. Dame Darcy brings the Gothic elements to life in her illustrations with an artistic flourish. I love these illustrations! They both complement the novel and are great on their own. This book was great to have on hand in class discussion on Jane Eyre and gothic literature.The text of this copy is the second edition of Jane Eyre with it's great preface by Bronte. It is a wonderful novel.
0	Too small: I did not realize the "collector's library" edition of this book would be so small - almost too small to read.
0	Vintage Classics Edition--proceed with caution.: I just received this Vintage Classics edition of Jane Eyre, chosen for the striking red cover, only to discover that 50 pages are missing (251-298). There is nothing more frustrating than being caught up in a wonderful book and having to come to a screeching halt because of a manufacturer's error, especially since this was my first time reading Jane Eyre.
0	True love is blind *well, it is for Jane, anyway*: Bronte shows through Jane that sex is Not one of woman'snecessities. Rochester is ugly, but he has a mind. I wish all womenwere of this opinion.
0	The book never came: The book never came, after some email exchange with the seller, no conclusion, I filed a claim with Amazon and got the money back.
1	Nice classical read: This is another good classic I had to read for Literature by Women in college. Following Jane's life is sad, yet interesting. It takes some good twists and turns. Recommend reading it!
0	Bootleg Version: I'm sure Raintree County is a grand film, that's why I wanted to watch it. Unfortunately I was unable to watch the film due to bad quality of the picture. I think I know what happened there. All the original prints must have been lost because this picture looks like someone has had put a little cheap camera in front of a TV screen and recorded it from the VHS version of it. Even worse, the camera wasn't focused properly and the white balance must have been way off. On the other hand the picture on the cover of the DVD is blurred, so I guess no one can accuse the producers of unscrupulousness and dishonesty! Problem is I bought this online so I had no idea.
1	Incredible energy: I don't know how Jimmy Sturr does it. CD after CD, the energy level is amazing. He always includes a cajun number or two, in this case Cajun Fiddle, and a country track, this time Big Ball's in Cowtown. He's so prolific that, on track12, he tells he Can't Afford to Be a Star. I hope that's not true, Jimmy.
0	Nice try, but...: This book is a sincere attempt to deal with the incredible mess of LINUX networking. It's better than nothing. It has a lot of useful information. It also has a lot of typos and misstatements and turgid descents into pure confusion. It needs summary sections covering "all the things required to..." and a serious troubleshooting guide.
1	My son loves it: Great toy for my 9 month old. I couldn't even get it wrapped for Christmas! My son chews on it because he is teething, defiantly not meant to be chewed on but I still love it :]
1	Absoutely Wonderful: Recieve the Body Back Buddy last week. Have suffered with pain in shoulders for years. Always had to find somebody to work my pressure points. Not any more. My new best friend the Back Buddy can do all and more that was advertised. Some of the best money I ever spent.
1	Great for spot massage: The Body Back Buddy is great. This is the only device I have found that allows me to pinpoint a tight spot in my back to work it loose. This is perfect for use in between massages. It is much better than using the door jamb. I can easily massage my feet also while watching TV.
1	Awesome deep tissue pressure!: I get so tight in my neck and back, and it's hard to massage that away by myself. This thing looks funny, but man, it packs a punch. The pressure points are small, so be careful if you're not into deep tissue. There are pointed spots and more rounded spots, so if you like it on the lighter side, use one of the rounder spots. I use both. I tied a satin sheath over one of the protruding "branches" and that works great for sliding the thing around (over a shirt/blouse), without "sticking" when it comes to the plastic/skin contact. I can get rid of the tension in my neck and back very well with this thing. It sometimes hurts the day afterward, and I don't care. I just use it again, and the muscles are loose again.If you like it gentle, be careful with this. If you're like me, and aren't that delicate, then get this thing. It's well worth the $20.
1	Covers it all: Great item. Covers all the pressure points without paying for a therapist at $85 for 30 minutes. Great remedy for what aches you.
1	Body back buddy: This product delivers what it claims. I find it very useful and extremely effective at leveraging hard to reach places on my body and massaging deeply areas regardless of location. I would recommend this product to anyone who has muscle pain/ tightness and can't afford / doesn't want to visit a private masseuse. Considering what you get this is a great value!
1	Helpful product: I use this to message trigger points in my upper & mid back, as well as my upper traps and neck. It's very helpful in reaching otherwise difficult spots. My problems are quite chronic so this hasn't fully alleviated my trigger points but with more use I'm sure it will. I've found this works well with the "The Trigger Point Therapy Workbook" which you can buy here on Amazon.
1	Small but nice: It's pretty well done, nothing to say about that. It's really tiny though, and won't hold anything bigger than small letters.
0	not the same in the picture: when i was searching for one of these it was for my mom for a christmas gift this year. That was all she asked for. When I saw this one I liked it. it looked nice, big enough to hold letter without them hanging over and it also looked like it could hold them sideways.But when she got it and opened it up. It was totally different. Not at all what the picture looked like. I was very disappointed. Of course she hung it up. i dont understand if your going to advertise a product and someone buys it atleast send the one that is advertised.Other than the size it is nice work. I love the light color of the wood.
0	Too Small!: This product is way to small to hold any mail.... if you are looking for something to hold your mail in do some research first this only holds up to an index card size envelope!
0	NOT RECOMMAND...: TOTALLY DIFFERENT DESCRIPTION, TERRIBLE ASSEMBLING... VERY SMALL...NOT RECOMMAND... IF YOU WANT TO BUY ENVELOPE CASE OR SOMETHING... TRY OTHER PRODUCT....
1	Gift for teacher: I gave this to my favorite math teacher and she loves it. The projects make math concepts easier to understand.
1	Highly underrated: Great little movie. I'm surprised it didn't get better reviews. Kids and adults liked it. Check it out, good addition to your movie library.
1	Another Bette Davis Classic that does well: This is a pretty good performance by Bette Davis, Karl Malden in a movie that features a "poor twin" and a "rich twin". The "poor twin" kills the "rich twin" and takes over her life.Pretty similar to another movie called "Stolen Life" that explores the same theme, except she takes over the twins life after an accident, not after killing her.Although not one of her best, it is still a good watch and a good performance by both actors.
1	Very Good: I enjoyed this old movie. It is one of Bette in her later years but she still had it.The storyline was a twist too..
1	BRAIN DONORS?! MORE LIKE LAUGH LOANERS!: This movie is just too good for words. It gives you as many laughs as the red green show. The slapstick shenanighans keep comming as the laughs keep rolling. I once laughed so hard i fell asleep and woke up and turned the movie off. One liners, Obesity, Gags, Puns, ensue. Go and rent this now along with once bitten.
1	An amazing book, one of the best I ever read: A sparkling defense of the one thing most people seem to think indefensible, Christian orthodox thought (You know, old school). This book is a positive, intelligent, funny defense of the faith. One of the best I've ever read.
0	Horrible Formatting: This book has THE WORST formatting I've ever seen. It looks like it was hastily put together using Microsoft Word. Very amateurish. The cover doesn't even have the title on the spine, so I can't recognize it on my bookshelf.The version from BiblioBazaar:Orthodoxyis MUCH MUCH better, well worth the extra dollar or two.
1	A REALLY GOOD GAS GUN.: GUN IS VERY GOOD. LOOKS REAL, EXCEPT FOR THE ORANGE TIP. HEAVY, BUT NOT TOO HEAVY. SHOOTS WELL. CAN USE TRIGGER, SLIDE OR JUST POINT AND SHOOT. MAGAZINE HAS A BUTTON TO REMOVE BB'S LIKE A REAL GUN. I HAVE ONE PROBLEM THOUGH, ADDING GAS IS A PROBLEM. IT ALWAYS LEAKS, EVERY TIME. I HAVE A GAS REVOLVER, THAT NEVER LEAKS. I END UP GETTING BURNED, IF I'M NOT CAREFUL. I'M SURE IT HAPPENS WITH OTHER GAS GUNS. REVOLVERS DON'T SEEM TO HAVE THIS GAS LEAK PROBLEM. I GIVE IT A 4, CAUSE OF THE GAS LEAKAGE. THANK YOU
1	If you love Cajun or if you love rock 'n' roll: you'll love this great CD. The Bluerunners, yeah! Get 'em all!
0	not very useful: It kiind of works but I would rather use a magnifine glass. I have to tilt it to get light in and see what I am doing.
0	Marginally Acceptable: I would probably have returned this "loupe" (actually a cheap magnifying glass)if shipping hadn't exceeded what I paid for it. I have a true loupe, a 4x Schneider that cost me $80 on eBay. I thought that, for $6, a10x loupe would be handy for focusing my medium and large format cameras. It didn't work out that way.Only the very center area is in focus, more or less. One's eye has to be back about 5-6 in. from the "loupe". This all means that you only see a very tiny area, which makes using it a real pain. Comparing what I see with this thing at10x and what I can see with my Schneider at 4x, I wonder if it's really10x.I''m not a happy customer. This is the first crummy thing I've gotten from Adorama, having been a steady customer of theirs for several years. I'm disappointed and saddened.
1	Nice loupe, good price.: I bought this to replace an 8X Agfaloupe I used to have for slides and negatives. Both are good. At this power some of the negatives edges are cut off, but it's easier to see facial expressions. If you need near full frame go with 8X, more detail10X or even15X.
1	Good Clear Quality Loupe for price: Good Clear Quality Loupe for price. Construction could be better, but its a great value for the price.
1	Healing from diarrhea and Ulcerative Colitis: I have struggled with diarrhea from Ulcerative Colitis for the past year or so. I have tried many alternative therapies and as a last ditch effort to stay off of prednisone tried what this book recommends.I have been completely amazed at the results. I went from diarrhea all the time to better than I have been in many many many many years (I'm 43 now). I highly recommend this book and I thank God that He led me to it and made me desperate to try what this book recommends as it has been a major lifestyle change in what I eat.
1	Restoring Your Degestive Health: Love this book and Love Dr. Brasco -- just recently acquired him as a physician was so awesome to have a physician PERSONALLY call you when you're having issues instead of office help -- doesn't happen much anymore -- I learned alot from talking to him personally and from this book.
1	A Whimper not a Bang: I give this book 4 stars for taking on the topic but agree with other reviewers who find it disappointing ... perhaps because one gets one's hopes up to read a title like this, "the story of the King James Bible". McGrath has done some thorough research (it is his profession) and introduces some interesting data from the past but he is unable to weave his story together in a way that conveys with power, passion and enthusiasm what was one of the most stunning events in Anglo/American history. I think this book suffers in great part from lack of good editorship. I give it 4 stars for subject matter and being a unique attempt to explore and present in laymen's terms information about this spectacular creation, second only to Shakespeare for those of us who love the English language! -- but I give it a 2-1/2 for the rest.
1	In the Beginning: The Story of the King James Bible and How: Very well written, extremely informative and interesting. I learned alot more of how the Bible came about and how different Bibles developed. Interesting not only to the Christian community but also to history people. Fascinating read.
1	Thorough, complete, and quite witty as well: Alister McGrath has a gift for clarity of expression and unbiased treatment of the theological thought and history of any era of which he writes. In the Beginning, unlike his more scholarly works, makes the periods surrounding that of the King James Bible very accessible, even to those who have little knowledge of the time. His highly readable, often hilarious, style provides a very easily understood, very comprehensive treatment of both the theology and politics of the High Middle Ages and Reformation times.
1	worth the read: I am taking a class on Harlem renaissance literature and this was the first book assigned. It is easy to read and an enlightening story, the background information provided was interesting as well.
0	Gets there: It was an interesting read. At first it was tough to follow, but about halfway through you really get interested and the reader cannot put the novel down!!
1	GIRLS ARE MADE FOR LOVING: THE MOVIE IS A GREAT CULT CLASSIC FROM THE 70'S. A LITTLE SLOW AT TIMES BUT FUN.
0	Can a book be any duller?: Abby, the successful engineer returns back to her hometown after10 years where she meets Chase the former high school hottie. He has a big secret which we find out is the fact that he is illiterate... Their differences in education don't seem to matter, they still get together and plan to spend their future as a married couple, endless rambling on about it later I wish I had not wasted my time on this book.
1	Beautifully colored: I use the Universal deck in my professional work, but I love the coloring of this deck for personal use. It's strong and evocative, but in a quality way, not loud or garish.
1	MUSICA NORTENA #1: HOLA, UNAS POCA PALABRAS PARA DECIR QUE SI QUIEREN OIR MUSICA BUENA PUEDEN OIR A PESADO, IMAN, INTOCABLE, CONTROL, ALAZAN, RAMON AYALA, SICLON, PALOMO, INVASORES, CADETES DE LINARES,ESENCIA NORTENA, DULO NORTENO, Y MUCHOS MAS SIN OLVIDAR AL GRAN GRUPO LA FIRMA. TODAS SUS CANCIONES SON DEDICADAS A UANA PERSONA MUY ESPECIAL AL QUE QUIERO MUCHO. ARMANDO Y YAJAIRA POR/ VIDA
0	old-school text: Oi, how much more convoluted can a text get? With every edition, this text gets less organized. Or that is at least true for the last 3 editions, anyways ... Eg. In how many chapters can the topic of "symmetry" be covered? Keeping it to1 would be much easier to digest, thankyou.The text is written in old-school rambly style... sure, it covers all topics, but it is hard to learn from (and in my experience, even harder to teach from). There are better options out there. Nesse "Intro to Mineralogy" text.
0	returned my copy: I am surprised O'REILLY published such a weak book. To keep it short, it is one of those "click here, click there, you are done!" kind of books. I doesn't go much deeper than the Cocoa tutorials on Apple's developer site.
0	Good School Bag Not A Great Travel Bag.: I bought this bag for traveling. It is not very comfortable, the shoulder straps feel like they are filled with packing paper, and compared to similar priced bags the material is cheap. It looks great and has plenty of storage. I was replacing a 5 year old Targus Port Bag. Due to the edition of roller gear on the new port bags I decided to go with another bag. For my needs, I should have gone with a different company. Also to note is that the storage is great however, a fully packed bag will not fit in the over head bin of a smaller jet airliner.
0	Not worth the time....: I really was excited to start reading this book, thinking it would be full of smart, well-crafted essays that would truly make you think (you know, like Bill Hick's stand-up did). So, I was deeply disappointed to find this book just to be fill with uneducated rants that spent more time worrying about fitting a new Bush joke in, then about actually making a point. Great idea, horrible execution.
0	A bunch of whiny losers: Maybe this show appeals to some people, but to me the characters seem like a bunch of annoying, whiny retards. I can't stand the voices of the main actors - two of them shriek rather than talk. Rather than provide comedy that everybody can enjoy, Will & Grace revolves around cliches and gay sex jokes. Debra Messing is the only salvation in the show, but she's not enough to save bad comedy.
0	Bad re-imaging: There are several parts of the film when it just goes to a still photo and voice or backround music is heard. If I knew so much of the original film was missing I probably would not have bought it. I was disappointed in my purchase.DPrice
1	Best movie musical ever: An epic musical, flawlessly produced by Garland and Luft. A classic tale of stars treading on the (often perillous) arc of fame and popularity, has been beautifully told in song and story. Garland, Mason, Bickford and Noonan: superb actors -all. And that Judy Garland sang those great songs...They don't come better than this great movie musical, the most brilliant of all: a seamless marriage of song and story, with it's one true competitor being Garland's Wizard of Oz.
0	Wonderful Production but1937 Version Was BEST: Judy Garland's singing and dancing & George Cukor's directing saved this film from being a total flop. James Mason was horribly miscast as Norman Maine as were almost all the other characters. In defense of Mr. Mason who was an outstanding actor, noone could replace Fredric March as Norman Maine. This DVD has about 55 minutes of Premire Footage outside the Pantages Theater in1954 with interviews with attendees like Joan Crawford, Cesar Romero, George Jessel. This alone is worth the price of the DVD.
0	not enough: It looks like a microsfot brochure for the people who have no odea about Axapta. it is giving some basic knowledge for beginniners.
0	I did not understand the codes.: Book looked like hundreds of people had just read it. I haven't read it yet. Because to small print-worn etc.Of course Taylor Caldwell will not disappoint me.
0	I just can't get into it: I've had to force myself to read halfway through this book. The pilgrim chapters are the most interesting, but overall, it's just boring.
0	awful squeaking: yes this is cheap but that's for a reason. the slats are weak and my husband snapped one while assembling it. and worst of all, it is increadibly squeaky, and is getting worse.
1	just listen it: Scene from the second story: The god machine. All I know about this band, they from Montreal(Quebec) and they have a another album before scene from the second story. If you like post-rock music, you gonna really like this band, you just have to close your eyes and.....the energy of they music is unimaginable. I can't choose a song in particulary because they all make the album. If you like Mogwai, Slint, ...try to get a copy because unfortunately is discontinued...but I really don't know why!!!!!!
1	Good Ctrl, Promising Software (doesn't work always): Nice controller, comfortable, Plug n play. No problems, if the game detects the buttons, but had problem with quake 3, with the controller activated, the whole screen started going round and round (spinning). MDK 2 worked great though with analog controls. The analog controls work fine in Unreal tournament as well.The software is promising but could not get much out of it. The best use is to use it as plug and play and enjoy the games it supports.
1	Very confotable and configurable gamepad.: It's confortable, specially if you have big hands. I use it to play Fifa 2003 and X-Wing alliance. The software that maps the keys of the gamepad to those required by the game allows you to use it for any game.Actually I prefer it over a joystick for flight simulator games. It's a lot more confortable.
0	these are double dobby stripes: nowhere in the description does it say that these sheets are dobby striped. i was looking for solid white sheets. another disappointment!
1	Good general source: Although exploring nothing new about the Eastern Front and even making some mistakes in the introduction (for example about the Red Army Purges) this book is a very good source to have for the general account and movement of the German Army throughout1941 on the Eastern Front as well as the respective response from the Soviet side. Although more sources could and should have been used, I can understand why they were not, as the book would be too cumbersome and hard to follow. Detailed studies can be found in various other books of individual unit actions, but that is not what this book is for. If one has an interest in a certain action and/or day that an event occurred on, they can do their own research with this book being their beginning general account/source.
1	A source for some information: This work contains some interesting information, and can be used as a source in researching particular topics. But it , in my opinion, was never really comprehensive enough. And having had its most recent edition close to fifty years ago is not up-to- date.
0	Don't believe the Hype: I bought this movie after watching the previews on another movie. I am an action junkie; and this movie looked like tons of action. It was not. They must have shown all of the action scenes in the preview. This movie is VERY LONG, VERY SLOW, BORING, with a very disappointing ending. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME!!!
1	Glimpse into a hidden world: This collection of stories is more than simply a memoir of a childhood lived within a secluded harem. It is also a story of a process of change that took place decades ago as the country of Morocco was becoming an independent nation state.I was fascinated by the stories of the women who spent their lives hidden from the outside world within the family enclaves of the middle class in Morocco. I've purchased it for friends and colleagues who were interested in women's stories, both from a feminist perspective and from a humane one.The stories are told with sensitivity and compassion, as well as a deep respect for, and understanding of Islam.
1	Important read: Well written. Insightful. Entertaining. Informative. Important issues for our times. Interesting to compare Mernissi's childhood experiences with all that she has accomplished since.
1	Amazing: The content, research, and intellect that went into this very detailed book is nothing short of amazing. Very deep and extemely well written, you will find you cannot stop in the middle. If you want something to stimulate your thinking, challenge your ideas, and push you, READ THIS. It should be a textbook. OUTSTANDING...BUY IT, YOU WON'T BE SORRY...
0	Keep Looking!: This book was too ambitious. It covered too many topics, spanning from childhood to adulthood, without really getting to any helpful information. Don't waste your time or money on this one.
1	Safekeeping: I read this because I so enjoyed "A Three Dog Life," about a later period in the author's life after her husband suffered a traumatic brain injury. "Safekeeping" is not as engaging, but worth a look for those who enjoy memoirs and are interested in crafting their own.
1	_: This outstanding essay is included in Chomsky's book American Power and the New Mandarins. Great as it is, I would recommend spending a few dollars more to get American Power and the New Mandarins which contain this same text as well as chapters on "the responsibility of intellectuals," "the revolutionary pacifism of A.J. Muste," "on resistance," and much else.
0	Bridesheads Revisited: Interesting read, not really sure what I expected. Tended to be a bit ponderous. Still, it was a nice change from the usual modern story I often pick up
0	The SLOWEST read I've had in a long time! Boring!: I usually read a book in one or two nights after dinner. I've been on this book for over a week and have absolutely no problem putting it down. It is just a SLOW read; certainly doesn't have anything in it to hold my interest.I'm a person that refuses to give up (except for a few that I filed in a Mistakes folder) on my kindle. I think I'm up to 62% read now and will probably force myself to finish it but it will definitely get put into the mistakes folder.In other words --- it's just plain BORING!
0	Not JavaScript Objects: Not up to par with the normal writings of Wrox Press. This book talks a lot and gives ideas but fails to properly explain the code or the objects. Chapter 6 is an introduction and discussion on a database application but fails to be anything other than an expanded users guide for the app. More time could have been spent explaining how the object structure in the applications is being used. In my opinion the title miss leads you into something that the book really is not. It should be called "Ideas for what to do with JavaScript".
0	Waste of my Money: I have worked with javascript for some time and wanted to learn to create javascript objects and impliment them into my code. I thought that this would be the perfect book for my needs but I have never been so wrong. The book could be called "creating data structures using javascript" because it jumps right into complex examples of creating data structures with very little explanation of what is happing from a language prospective. I did get far enouph to write some BAD object code and post it out to a news group who got me on the right track. THIS IS NOT THE BOOK FOR YOU IF YOU ARE TRYING TO LEARN JAVASCRIPT OBJECTS FOR THE FIRST TIME. It is now in my trash basket.
0	Faulty Information?: Apparently the author has lived abroad too long. On page one he states: "A child born in the U.S., for example, is a U.S. citizen even if both of his parents are illegal immigrants." Not only is this untrue, a baby born to LEGAL immigrants isn't automatically granted citizenship. The rules changed long before the publishing of this book--the author should verify his facts. I can't help but wonder if the whole book isn't fully of erroneous information (I only read the first ten pages, which are available at the publishers site).
0	my child called this "the worst game ever": I will say the 3-d fx do work...for a hand-full of pictures, you have to lay out all the cards ( you will need a massive table or the kitchen floor) and search for random objects great concept poorly executed. as the title of the review stated. The10 year old said "this is the worst game ever" we played it once and it's collecting dust on the shelf.
0	bearing problems: Both the original and a replacement Keller dovetali bit quickly lost the lower seal on the bearing which will allow sawdust to build up in the bearing and will lead to premature failure.
1	Great and professional product: This is one of the best RC Ni-Starter out there. I did a lot of research before buying this product. It's with no double one of the most durable and professional.
1	Best bedding set out there!: The Safari set is the cutest set around and affordable!My mom purchased almost every item in the collection online.The ONLY downfall was that we couldn't find any items in a store near us and there are items we would like to get, like the lamp, and Target doesn't carry it anymore.With a10% discount, we payed under a dollar in shipping.We were even more satisfied when we viewed the items in person.I HIGHLY recommend this set for a baby girl or boy.
0	Rethink before you buy: It is in no way the bedding that I don't like. I absolutely love the bedding, however as far as Target making it accessable. that is an entirely different issue. If you plan on getting this as a set you better start checking E-Bay now, because that was the only way I could complete the set. Unfortunately I didn't buy EVERYTHING at once and by the time I went back to purchase the bumper and dust ruffle the manufacturer had discontinued the item.(It wasn't a significant amount of time either). In addition Target was VERY unwilling to help. To make a long story short- if it says arriving soon, rather than a ship date chances are you won't recieve that item, because it is no longer made. Again the bedding is adorable, but for the hassle you'll have to go through to decorate save youself the time and go elsewhere.
1	Love the Look and the Quality!: I've purchased or recieved almost all of the pieces to this set for my baby boy's nursery and I absolutely love them. This set has bright colors and a fun feel to it! With a different wall paint color, it could easily be for a girl as well. The quality is excellent as far as I can tell and is an improvement from the plain pastel colors that everyone else has to offer!
1	Look on EBAY: I bought the set as well and love it!! I went on ebay and saw a seller that had a lot of the accessories I wanted. I emailed her and asked her if she could get other items I needed. Now I have all pieces to the collection.
1	Very difficult to locate all items: I absolutely LOVE this set; however, it is terribly difficult to locate all of it! Only one store in my area even has it in stock, and they don't have everything. I bought the dust ruffle and it doesn't fit on our standard crib- it is an inch too short (not length of the ruffle to the floor, but end to end), I was very disappointed. I adore the &quot;wall hanging&quot; animals, but, not only are they unlisted online, but they are quite hard to find. Once Target sees the popularity of a pattern-they should make a better attempt to make it available; might I suggest a way to locate what local stores have it available to save a multitude of phone calls etc...
1	Perfect for newbies (like me)!: I'm new to c++ and decided to try to learn it through this book.It works magnificent in teaching me how C++ works, how to code in it and how to convert C code.It is writen in a very conversational way and it always have some code besides the explenation (I for one enjoy reading the code also when I'm reading the explenation of a new feature!).This book is realy good for teaching people the basics!I hope you will enjoy this book as much as I do (I ain't finished with it as I'm writing this review).
1	Suhrhold deck Brush: My latest purchase of the Shurhold brush head is a replacement for one that I have had for twenty five years. It is the only brush I will use on my car as it is soft enough not to scratch the paint. The old brush is reserved for cleaning the garage floor. It is still useable after 25 years.
1	Locke gave a thorough understanding for society.: I thought that this book did a good job of explaining the role of the society and of the government. It also sets up a State of Nature to justify the State. It tells the role of the individual, and the rights entitled to the individual upon entering the State. I enjoyed this book, and enjoy Locke's philosophy.
1	Optima Deep Cycle Yellow: Great Battery. I use lots of accessories and with a high output ALT this battery does the job. If you run AMPS etc this is the battery for you. Lots of reserve power for the Optima Yellow Category. I recommend it as your next Battery....
1	Detailed and informative, BUT.......: Robert Gordon's account of Muddy's life encompasses the entire spectrum of a great bluesman's struggles and successes from birth to his death in1983. The additional notes at the back of the book are great reading and I enjoyed the time I spent learning of Muddy Waters' life.However....there are two major mistakes in the picture subtitles. One identifies Ron Wood of the Rolling Stones as Mick Taylor. Mick had quit the band years before the1978 photo was taken. Another photo showing Muddy and Son Sims in1943 identifies the guitar that Muddy is holding as a National steel guitar, when it is obviously a wood bodied resonator, not a steel bodied guitar. If Mr. Gordon is this free and loose with his checking of the facts on the pictures, it leaves me in doubt as to the quality of his research on all the other data in the book.
1	funny BUT bad: It is FUNNY... VERY Funny!!!!! its just too bad he has to be so vulgar... beyond the very often F Bombs he drops..... he is a very funny man!
0	Just so you know...: Carlos is neither Mexican nor original. He doesn't want us to get offended by his empty racial jabs (which don't offend me), but I do take offense at his ripping off other, better comedians. It's not an easy thing to come up with material...well, good material anyway. Think of it like a song or a novel. If you wrote a terrific song, performed it at some club and then heard a crappier version of it, recorded by another band, on the radio wouldn't it bother you? Why is comedy any different? If you think it is, then by all means buy this hack's junk, but if you respect integrity don't support this jerk.
0	Hoff doesn't really understand human nature.: I don't know if it's a flaw in Taoism or in Hoff's logic, but he preaches the importance of appreciating things as they are and not struggling against them, while ignoring the fact that the nature of humanity is to change things. Humans struggle to become (or at least appear) other than what they are, and this involves changing the self and the things around oneself. Hoff foolishly ignores this and reduces humanity to the level of fish that are trying in vain to whistle.
1	The Irregulars: This movie is so pleasant and funny that any audience will love it. The resultant outcome is not conservative at all but does play to most everyone's joy.
0	Inconsistent performance: (+)Great price, high speed(-)HOWEVER before you buy this consider whether a cordless phone is used nearby. The DLINK card consistently drops connections when I use my 2.4 GHz phone even at 200 ft away. Yes, I should expect that due to the fact they use the same frequency but I NEVER experience interference with my 2Wire wireless card which was so much more reliant and is used at the same location. The DLINK card keeps dropping connections when the phone is used. It is incredibly frustrating and I am going to consider returning it.Third DLINK product I've bought, third satisfactory result from them. I've also used a total of 6 wireless cards and 3 wireless routers/access points. Although DLINK isn't at the bottom of the heap, it sure hasn't performed at the top. Checkout 2WIRE (hard to get retail) or Netgear's equipment.
0	absolute junk: I have had nothing but trouble with this product. no matter how many times i have dowload new, or older, drivers, the installation is never complete. their help desk neither has been able to provide with any help to this problem (though they have tried).i will not spend money on another dlink product.
1	a very good wireless card: This card has given me the ability to be crazy and sit outside with my laptop and do my work from there. For some reason I feel much more creative when I am outside in the open air rather than inside in the boring stale air.This card was installed in almost no time at all and it felt like it was almost too easy. But after the reboot I was able to find and see that the card was installed correctly and the quick time wasn't a bad thing, but a good thing.The wireless range seems pretty good. I use a DI-524 as my wireless router, but I also don't have a very big home. Either way I am satisfied and would think others would as well.
1	Fast and stable, if you don't protect access: It works fine with D-Link DI624 wireless router, if you don't set any kind of protection tool. I have got stable and strong connections at108 Mbps in any point of my house, even with many walls between DWL-G650 and DI-624.At this moment, I am connected for almost 6 hours, without crash and always at108 Mbps. It works fine with my Sony Vaio notebook and with Toshiba's. But its stability vanishes when I configure any tool for secure networking (WEP, WPA, WPA-PSK ...). So, it works fine, but is not secure.
1	A real winner: I am glad this was my first choice for a wireless adapter. I was told to go out and buy a wireless adapter and with help from the local store's employee he recommended me this card. He said D-Link was a good reputable company. I believed him and bought this card and brought it home. Besides if he wasn't right I could always return it right back to him. :)Either way I was able to get this working by following the intstructions and was connected to my work's wireless network in minutes. I thank the helpful employee who helped me and I thank D-Link. Thank you both.
1	works really well: I think most of my frustration is due to my ISP, but this thing has been great really. The best feature doesn't even come in the box, but the tech support is phenomenal. I spent a bit of time on hold, but the guy I spoke with had me up and running in no time at all.In general, the setup is easy (I'm using it with the D-Link DI-624). The program installs everything for you, I ran into trouble after my ISP shut down my service for some foolish reason and made me change some settings which I guess messed with my network setup. In any case, this comes highly recommended for anyone that wants to set up a wireless network, even if you aren't particularly computer savvy, as I am not.
0	Does not install properly on HP notebook running XP: Did not install properly. DLInk customer services was not one bit helpful. Drivers have not passed Microsoft's scrunity. I cannot recommend this at all.
0	Poor quality: Very poor recording. Sounds like it is muffled or filtered. Fortunetly most of these tracks are recorded correctly on the 2 CD set "The Magic Touch". Skip this and go to "The Magic Touch"
1	Works Great.: I do a little bit of gaming and have compared wireless to running a hard wire and don't find any difference in speed or signal strength. It works well throughout my house (two story 2500 square ft).
0	Piece of Junk: I chose D-Link because of their customer support 24/7 for the life of the product. I have gone through 2 DI-624. DSL and Cable Modem (Road Runner). It keeps DROPPING THE SIGNAL. From reading another review, its true that the firmware updates are what kills this router. Each update creates new problems. Everyone tells me to use Linksys and I am getting one now... PS I have used D-Link for over 3 yrs!
0	Don't Waste your time or money: This unit is terrible, its poorly made, cheap does not work well with Macintosh computers and the tech-support is terrible! The tech support - barely speaks english, is difficult to understand and the phone connections are awful - made me wonder why they even offer tech support. Trust me this is not a good product.
0	shipping: The router is good- ... 3btech is less than dismal on shippingI ordered with a 3day select ups ship and received over the 3 dayperiod - they had some lame story about not shipping until the1st full business day - .. which was two days AFTER I placed the order - they refused to do anything refund wise -I will never do business with them again-
0	piece of crap: d-link needs to get its act together. this router of airplus is a laugh. never seen so much problems from one equipment. lost connection, rebooting itself every half hour, losing signal, rebooting computer to get back signal. returned twice over a span of 3 weeks. fianlly returned back for good for another brand. a linksys speedbooster. now that works great!!tech support wasn't helpful either..spent more time on phone with tech than anybody else. still didn't get the problem solved. each one kept telling me to return the router back and get another one after there book runs out of troublehsooting ideas. tired of that...:( the tech needs help with updatng there knowledge of the equipment and manners. d-link needs to rebuild there router again.its not worth it......buy a linkys speedbooster or netgear instead.
1	3btech & Amazon: I ordered a DI-624 from Amazon by way of 3BTECH. They sent the wrong Router which was an upgrade a DI-624M. But I used the DI-624 on my system and there is a difference in the speed. 3BTECH told me they where the same but if you read the manual they are not. They would not take it back without me paying a shipping charge and restocking fee. Don't deal with 3BTECH because Amazon will not back them up and you don't get the same service like when you deal with Amazon. Stay away from this 3rd party company. You can only contact them by way of e-mail.
0	dlink sucks: i am so disappointed because tech support was unhelpful. they could not get my laptap wireless running they blamed on my laptap. i was using smc wireless perfectly except its speed up to 54mbps.
1	Great workhorse: I've been using this router for years and it has never given me problems. The setup is easy and the maintenance is non-existent. The signal is strong enough to get to my Xbox 360, which is downstairs and across the house.What's so amazing is that while my computer and its components get replaced every few years, this little workhorse has stayed with me through it all.Highly recommended.
0	Waste of money - no range: From the word go, this router has been painful. I have a1-room radius from this piece of junk. Sometimes, I one bar on my iphone with it sitting ontop of the router!Easy set up and everything, just doesn't work when set up!
0	Connection Problems - cannot use all features: I have had this router for over a year. It worked well for the most part. But every once in a while I got problems with connection, for which I had to call customer support.Now suddenly it has become a big pain ... Both wired and wireless connections drop every10 mins because router reboots itself. I have made over a dozen calls to tech support, but the problem has remained.The other thing is that D link tech support always tells you to go with basic 802.11b config with no encryption ( the most they would let me do was WEP, and always turned down WPA ). So even though this router has a lot of cool features ( super G, WPA, gaming mode etc. etc. ) , you are not allowed to use any of them. That is because if you try and it does not work, tech support will always tell you to turn all of them off. Thus all I have is a powerful router being used as basic 802.11b.
0	Didn't work for me...: I futzed with this for about a week. Had d-link tech support's number programmed into my phone (power down the router, press the reset key, replug everything, yada yada yada). I bought this router and the PCI wireless card for my desktop because of the excellent reviews I read on this item at CNET and PC Magazine. The PCI card froze my desktop EVERY time I turned the network on and the router would not connect to my laptop even when the units were a few feet apart. Exchanged for Linksys and have had not one call to tech support. I suppose this will work for a lot of people, but for me this operated as a1 star product. Do buy from a place you can easily return (like Amazon!) because if your experience is like mine, you will get fed up talking with the tech support people and try something else!
1	Over my head?: Frustrating at first because it took me a little while to learn how to use the D-Link Router. Once I learned what all of the terms meant, it was smooth sailing. Now I have a safe wireless computer, am able to work outside or at a neighbor's house! One more thing I must say, this is working on an OS X v.10.3.9. This wireless system almost felt like it was made for my little Mac. I did a lot of research to find the best wireless router for this computer and this is the only one I could find that claimed to "welcome Mac." computers.
0	Ripoff: I bought this product from Best Buy about a year and a half ago; my family got cable and a wired network just wasn't feasible with our layout, so we went with this D-Link device.Connection drops every few minutes, and sometimes it won't come back up until the router is rebooted...which requires unplugging the router and the modem, then putting them through their boot cycles one at a time. When it works its best we do this every other day, at its worst we do it daily; today it had to be rebooted three times in one hour.I've tried multiple connection devices, DWL122, DWL G650, DWL G520, and whatever one came built into my sister's Dell. Getting closer to the router hasn't helped; it still even dropped packets. (As an example, an instant message or two may simply never reach me.)Needless to say, my family's looking for something new since their tech support's suggestions were useless.
0	Buy another router-unstable connections: DI-624 router frequently disconnects itself from all computers, wired and wireless, attached to it. What's more, it will reboot and might take up to 5 minutes to establish a connection, which may happen in the middle of a download.D-link suggests that you downgrade the speed to10Mb which will reduce files transfer speed in your network by a tenfold. But the issue is not resolve. Upgrading to new firmware (2.50)won't resolve the issue either. Furthermore, replacing the network card for a new one won't resolve the issue.If you want to spend many hours fussing, calling & e-mailing tech support and rebooting a router and reconfiguring it until you are red in the face....go for it...
1	Caveat usage: Like the previous reviewer, I am finding lots of incompabilities between vendors. My D-L 624 works just peachy with the built-in in my wife's Dell, and likes my Proxim Orinoco. It hates my son's Linksys when any form of encryption is enabled, but with WEP off handles it fairly well. For work I coupled the D-Link 624 with the 650 card and it works just fine. I had my son buy a Linksys card because the router that he's sharing at school is a Linksys, but which refused to recognize the Proxim card that works with my D-Link. I think all of this indicates just how imature this technology is. It probably ain't you if it doesn't work.Also, DLink does a pretty good job of updating their firmware, and you probably want to take the time to update the BIOS (easy, just follow the fairly clear instructions) before you start loading MACs and enabling things (you can't import your old settings after you flash the bios - you start over from the beginning).
1	Delivers as promised: Not only does this product deliver all that is advertised but the service from D-Link is without a doubt the best in the high tech industry. Every vendor should take notice.
0	can't handle browser idle time (poor support): Installation was easy and everything looked great. Until I tried to access the internet via my browser the next morning ("page cannot be displayed"). All ideas of the helpdesk how to fix it didn't change anything (we exchanged about 20 emails) so that they agreed it was a hardware problem. I returned it and got the next one with the same problem. The answer of the helpdesk this time: don't use ZoneAlarm. And if this is not the problem, then it must be Windows XP. Unfortunately, shutting down ZoneAlarm didn't fix the problem. So the problem must be Windows XP in their opinion. That's an easy excuse because nobody can prove anything and I got stuck with my router and my problem. So I returned it.Conclusion: if you have a dial-up connection and don't stay connected while being idle, this is a good product. If you have a cable modem and don't shut down your computer all the time, try a different router.
0	Awesomely horrible product: Wow. What can I say other than this has got to be one of the worst electronic purchases that I've ever made. The DWL-G650 is a pretty good PCCard, however the DI-624 router is absolutely horrid! From the moment I plugged it in it wouldn't quit rebooting itself every1-2 minutes kicking me off the network. Firmware flashes didn't solve the problem at all nor did a replacement product. (Incidentally, Amazon.com was WONDERFUL about sending a replacement product). How D-Link gets away with selling this product is beyond me. I'd read similar reviews on the product with it constantly rebooting however I must admit that I'd written those off as the typical "home user" that really didn't know what they were doing. Well, as a network engineer and systems administrator at one of the world's largest computer companies, I have to throw my towel in to the absolutely worst network product I've ever worked with here in the DI-624. Please... avoid this router at ALL costs.
1	Not as good as season one, but...: Season one South Park was hilarious, an absolute riot - But unfortunately it lost its way a little in season two. However, season two is still really funny and these DVDs are well worth buying. If you have a high (and I do mean high!) tolerance level of all things foul, then you HAVE TO buy South Park: Bigger, Longer, Uncut - UNBELIEVABLY FUNNY, YOU WILL NEVER SEE ANYTHING MORE FUNNIER!
0	Not so funny: Just got through watching this. The jokes are cruder, less funny, and they just keep on beating on the same thing again and again. I enjoyed the first 3 volumes but these don't cut it. Also, you can't fast forward thru the credits or FBI warnings (that appear with each cartoon. I was disappointed in this release.
0	Awful!: This is one exploitation that has no story; or the story is so hard to follow that it is incomprehensible. Rita Calderone is gorgeous, but other than that - this movie is thumbs down.
0	In a word: Terrible.: How anyone could rate this debacle above one star is beyond me. First of all, this is not the Grateful Dead that you hear playing all your favorite songs. This is a sad and withered remnant of the once great band. I love the Grateful Dead so I decided to buy this box set hoping that, although the shows are from the early 90s, that the band could still rock. Unfortunatly, I was wrong. Their playing is awful. Its sparse and sprinkled with lame synth garbage with whatever keys player they dredged up this time, it really doesn't matter who. They play such classics (hint: sarcasm) as Wang Dang Doodle, Touch of Grey (which was, incredibly, their only chart topper even though its an awful song), My Brother Esau, and sundry other lame songs. Do yourself a favor, if you love this band, don't buy this box set, its like watching a dying lion. You know how powerful it was in its heydey, but all you can see now is a sick, mottled mess. Stick with their audio stuff.
1	Recommended: The conclusion and final disintegration of the formerly powerful patriarchal family. Brings one through the third generation of tradegy, loss, and spiritual transformation and leaves almost every individual in misery. I enjoyed the first and final books in this trilogy and feel I came away with a better understanding of the conflicting forces at work in Egypt as well as the impact of culture and morality on individual actions and spirituality.
1	Awesome!: Omg These are so dang cute! I can't wait to try them out! I used the top part as a 'cookie' mold but I'm gonna use the entire thing next time. :)
1	Could be compared with Living Colour: These guys remind me of a softer Living Colour (Vernon Reid, etc.) Not bad for mid nineties. The music hasn't aged much at all. Highly recommended.
0	terrible, even at a low price: I bought these clippers for cutting hair at home. Even when fully charged they offer very little power and tend to bog down when clipping only mildly thick hair. The charge doesn't last through one haircut.The trimmer blades come off when you try to advance them with the thumb slider to adjust the length of hair being cut, and they don't trim evenly. I finally gave up on the trimmer attachment and went with just the trimmer blade over a comb.I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone. I was extremely disappointed in it.
0	Piece of junk - do not bother.: I've been very disappointed with this since we got it. Even with the unit fully charged & operating with the cord plugged in, it struggles to keep up with normal hair cutting. It takes multiple passes to cut, what would have taken our last trimmer, a Norelco plug in model that lasted 8 years, one pass.Build quality: poor. Everything in the kit feels cheap.Too bad we held onto this past the 30 day return policy. Do not buy this trimmer.
1	Excellent for the money: I have used a Wahl hairclipper for many years, but wanted one that was more portable and had guidecombs that would allow me to cut my hair a little longer. The Wahl model 9627 is compact and flexible. The guidecombs allow me to cut my hair up to1 and 3/4 inches long. The unit can be used with or without a cord and the smaller size makes it easier to maneuver than larger ones. It does an excellent job of cutting hair. It does not appear to be as durable as my other Wahl clipper, but that is an acceptable tradeoff. It worked flawlessly out of the box and has a two yr warranty. The money I am saving on haircuts makes that a bargain.
1	If you want to improve your health, read this book: I highly recommend all of Norman Walker's books. Although written many years ago, I think they are even more relevant in today's world. It is an easy to read book with information that will have you wanting more even information about the subject. Also, please read all his other books.
1	Great!: I thought this movie was awesome. I've always thought Dana Carvey was a hilarious actor and this movie was just as funny as he. I recommend it!
0	A waste of talent: This movie was probably the biggest bomb of1994. It's a real shame too as it has some talent in it's ranks like James Earl Jones, Dana Carvey, and Kevin Pollak. However, this was very unfunny. Mind you my heart really wasn't into this movie anyway as I had a rejection the night before I saw this, so I couldn't focus into the movie, but there really wasn't anything to focus into here. It's about a guy who has amnesia whenever he goes to sleep, and he ends up witnessing a murder.....what's so funny about that? I honestly feel that this is one of the worst if not "THE" worst movie ever made. This was even worse than "Ishtar" folks. I don't have any desire to see this again, and I won't own it either. Like I said this was the biggest bomb of1994.
1	The beauty is in the truth: People,wake up!The truth may hurt sometimes,but,it gives a picture.Lee has given me what I needed,an insiders view,albeit a bit of a kick to Beckett at times,but,I was never there,was I?I see music,or hear music,and,Tim Buckley is me seeing,hearing,and knowing my home.Lee has given me an answer to why my home is thus,and thank the lord I am not alone.I read Blue melody 3 hours straight,and finished it off this morning,I ate it,rather than read it,and,Lorca and Starsailor demand my attention,these seem to me to be the main message in the book,don't talk,just listen..As much as David Browne may seem sincere in his writing of "Dream brother",there is no substitute for knowing the man,Tim Buckley,than for reading Blue Melody,by a friend who was there.Starsailor,you will never dim.Lee,shine on.
1	My Pup Can't Get Enough of Them: My Rottweiler is allergic to almost every animal protein on the planet. So far, he is doing ok with whitefish and salmon. That is why this treat is so good. It does smell strongly of fish, it smells good. Its got a crunchy texture, its unlike any other pup treat I've found. My pup loves it, when I take the bag out of the pantry he runs to the kitchen and sits for his treat. Don't even have to call him.The 28oz resealable bag is great, the treats last a long time. If your pup has allergies, you may want to think about giving this one a chance. Guaranteed, your pup will love them.
1	A realistic view of what it is like to have dementia: This was a book that was kind of hard to read at times because it was written by an individual who actually had Alzheimer's. However if you really want to see how the individual themselves are affected by the disease this is a good book to try to read.
0	Only for those in absolute need of resolution: I never thought I would say this about a book in this series, but I hate this book. I was absolutely disappointed with the way Card chose to resolve his story. I'll give him license since he may do what he will with his story, but I feel so bitter about this ending to such a magnificent saga that I can't recommend this to anybody that isn't dying of curiousity at the end of "Xenocide".And to those who believe you fit in this category, I'm sorry for the feelings you will like possess upon completion. I honestly feel the same unrest now as I did when I finished "Xenocide". I hope everyday that Card will come to his senses and revise his plot here to be more logical, less rushed, more conclusive (which some may argue with), and more fulfilling to a character of such quality as Ender Wiggin.
0	Should never have been written: I highly recommend NOT reading this book, which managed to diminish the magic of Ender's Game for me. Stop at Xenocide, which was pretty good, and skip straight to Ender's Shadow, which is VERY good. This book is exceedingly disjointed, makes way too much of the Valentine/Peter dichotomy, and is boring, boring, boring. Where I couldn't put the other Ender books down, I had to really struggle to finish this one. And then wished I hadn't.
0	Weak ending to a great series: I was disappointed with this fourth (and presumably final) installment of the Ender saga. Indeed, this story isn't really about Ender at all but about the 2 Ender "clones", Peter and Valentine. While this does not make this a bad novel, frankly, I was hoping that Card would have found a way to make the demise of Andrew Wiggen, one of the more interesting protagonists in science fiction, more memorable. Wiggen's death is reduced to almost a footnote in this installment and I could never generate the same degree of interest in either Peter or the young Valentine
0	A poor ending to a great story: I can't tell you how dissapointed I was in this book. It was not what I have come to expect from Orson Scott Card. Many authors take a concept to the point where they just fill pages with words (i.e. Piers Anthony & his Xanth tales), but I expected more from this author. I know Card is capable of better work Treason, and the entire Alvin Maker series are a testament to that, but this last book in the Ender Wiggins saga is not in the same class as his other works. My best advice is to ignore this book and enjoy the Ender Wiggins Trilogy
0	How could this happen?: I dunno--I liked the other three books in the series. For some reason, though, this one just seemed tedious. Character interaction is there, sure, but it seems dull and plodding. Everything about it just seems to lack the spark that usually makes Card so great. I suppose if you've read the rest of the series you'll probably want to read this one too, but don't expect too much. Card's biggest (only?) letdown.
0	Card should have quit while he was ahead !: He misses the mark on almost all counts. The charecterization sucks and the plot *feels* manufactured. The growth of Ender Wiggin from a child to the speaker for the dead has been dealt with beautifuly in his earlier books but the entwining of ALL threads into this story is frankly unacceptable.In fact I even see traces of Alvin in Children of ..
1	GREAT ENDING TO THE BEST SCI-FI SAGA EVER WRITTEN: "Jane closed her eyes, smiled, and then all four of them were gone. Only the mothertree remained in the center of the clearing, bathed in light, heavy with fruit, festooned with blossoms, a perpetual celebrant to the ancient mystery of life" I write this last paragraph of "Children of the Mind" from memory as I felt it was worth it to memorize the ending to the greatest SCI-FI saga ever written. This book ending the "Ender's Saga" is a masterpiece of writing. The characters are rich and full of life both good and bad. The morale battles waged are gripping and thought provoking. I recommend without any reservations that anyone who loves to read a well written story that they buy all the books in the series and pass them on to friends, family and loved ones as you will be giving them a gift of more than just words on a page but a gift of what life is all about.
1	A new triumph of a great mind: This book, the forth in the Ender series shows whyOrson Scott Card is one of the best writers of ourtime.Every novel in the serie has been as different fromthe ones before it as books in a serie can be.In this novel Card brings to conclusion the storyof Ender Wiggins in a way that is both surprisingand highly imaginative.This is a book that no Card fan, and in fact noscience fiction fan, can afford to miss.
0	Too many miracles....: Children of the Mind read similarly to the stories I wrote in 2nd grade. Though more sophisticated, it had the same rambling tone, as if the author didn't quite know where to take it, and wrote the story while searching for a way out. In doing so, the story became too unbelievable, to be enjoyable. There were too many miracles, too many near deaths, too many almost destructions. Every time Card couldn't think of a way to get himself out of a tight situation, a new "miracle of science" was discovered, making the story a winding tale. The question is raised: Is it fair to give a lightsaber to a man facing lions?The ending left you hanging, but I, for one, have no desire to learn or read more. I have a feeling this was not meant as the end of a series, but the beginning of a new saga. A saga that may draw in others, but will continue to destroy the perfection of the original, Ender's Game
0	Things kind of got crazy...: ...and the thread of the story seems to just run further away from the original concepts. Wasn't thrilled with the new ideas expressed in it and wouldn't recommend it as a good read.
1	Very scary and very good!: Once I started this book I couldn't put it down! The only thing I didn't understand was the ending. Otherwise this was a great book!
0	I didn't get "it": I like Adam Sandler, but I didn't like or "get" this movie's point at all. Forewarning: This is not Sandler's typical role. I'm all for him branching out into different styles and I think he's quite capable, except I had a very hard time getting past that because of all the weirdness in this film.The opening sequence is just bizarre and you wonder throughout the entire film what the point of the instrument is. The relationship between Sandler and his love interest is equally bizarre. This has DEFINITELY an indie type of film feel, but does not come close to ONE HOUR PHOTO, which I think also has the same type of feel, yet is far superior. This movie is disturbing at times and confusing at others. I felt like I was doing drugs during this movie (which I can assure you I was not). The ending is a "Huh?"
0	Move on: I saw this movie when it was originally released and have to say that may thoughts of it have not gotten any better in that time. I had high hopes for it going in and kept waiting for that moment when I would feel that my money had not been wasted. The moment never came. This was an awful movie. Boring dialog, uninteresting characters, painfully slow pacing. This is really no different than any of the other movies Paul Thomas Anderson has written and directed. This is the worst of the big 3 but they are all highly overrated.
0	Worst Movie I've Ever Seen: I've seens some bad movies in my day, but this one takes the cake. There is no subtle charm in this movie whatsoever. There are several scenes that have nothing but silence - no background mood music, nothing. Then, many of the other scenes have painful background music that drags on and on. Further, the cinematography is horrible. There are random camera shakes which I thought are part of the plot line when in fact it is just poor production. Not surprisingly, Adam Sandler cannot hold his own in a non-comedic role. His acting skills left a lot to be desired. As I walked out of the movie after about 40 minutes, I noticed that the door in the back of the theater was left open. I soon realized why as more people began walking out after I did. Make your own decision here, but I strongly recommend seeing anything else, or go golfing or something. Don't waste your time.
0	Don't Bother: How anyone could think this movie was anything but complete garbage was beyond me.I guess a lot of these reviewers are extremely "deep."
0	Not Worth Watching -spoilers-: This movie is a bore! And kind of annoying!It's not a romance/comedy! Drama...er...a little? Not a lot.Alright, the story itself is good. Plot is terrific, characters alright. Acting is great.The constant music through-out the movie was just annoying. The camera angles and shadow shots were just irritating. The only character that wasn't a complete Mary-Sue (or one-dimensional) was the main character, Barry.This could have been a great movie if it wasn't for the script, the shooting style, and the annoying background music.
0	Save your time and your money...: I saw this movie after seeing trailers for it on a couple of occasions. I thought it looked like a light comedy/romance. What a waste of my time and money! The only thing that kept me from leaving the theater was the hope that it HAD to get better eventually. Wrong. I'm not a big Adam Sandler fan, but that wasn't it at all. I actually thought he was pretty good in this, but I thought the movie itself was disgusting and depressing. One review I saw said it was a "dark comedy"....well I agree that it was definitely dark! Not much of a comedy, though. Thank goodness we all have differing tastes, because some people may see something redeeming in this movie, but I truly thought it was one of the worst movies I have ever seen!! Again, save your time and your money!
0	Sad, sad, movie: I love quirky and insightful movies. I watch THE USUAL SUSPECTS, SPANISH PRISONER, GLEN GARY GLENROSS, and all the rest and enjoy them over and over, relishing in the twists and turns and messages that these movies dispense. But, I'm not going to slap kudos on PUNCH DRUNK LOVE. This move is as disturbing as it is sad. The violence is not enjoyable. It was nothing like the trailers portrayed it to be and I will not recommend it to anyone.
0	punch drunk love: This has to be the worst movie I have ever seen. Adam sandler is the ony reason i kept watching. No plot, No real story to the characters. SAVE YOUR MONEY!
1	The Craziest Most Beautiful Movie In A Long Time: A great example of a film that was able to combine a weird dramatic tension with a crazy emotional tension: laughter/crying at the same time. Crazy dialogue and situations that logically shouldn't work, but do in the most amazing way. The best American film since David Lynch's Mulholland Dr.
1	ANOTHER GREAT NOVELLA BY THE AWESOME DIVAS: I truly enjoyed this work of fiction by my favorite authors. I hate to tell what is in a book, but when you see these four authors and including Felicia Mason, pick up the book and run to the counter. Each story centralized around age, divorce, widow, lost love and true love. Each story was awesome and you wouldn't be upset at all that you decided to purchase it. Pick up this book and let the adventure begin. Read the other reviews and they will tell you a little more. I love to read and watch a good movie and I get highly upset when I am told about it before I got a chance to read or watch it.
0	Flexrake100A: I have had a hula hoe for year. It has worked will and the handle is worn out. After receiving this aluminum handled Hula Hoe it broke after two weeks. It is because of the way the aluminum handle is inserted into the hoe head. They make cuts along the end of the handle and insert it into the taped end of the head. This makes it very weak. I bent after a little use. I contacted Hula Hoe and they are sending me a new handle. However, until they swedge the end ot fhte handle to fit the head instead of cutting it the handle will only break again unless it it reinforced with a wood plug, which is what I plan on doing. Intill the design is changed I would recommend only the wood handled model.
1	Four Stars - For this price you know what to expect!: I'm not going to get into many technical details. Not because I can't but because at this price range you KNOW what you are getting. With that said this unit has performed very well. Most of us will never run this at the high end of the volume spectrum, so distortion isn't an issue. The average person will be more than satisfied with this unit. One thing I will mention is that the "Auto Calibration" (for speaker set-up) using the included mic was not close enough for me. Most people probably wouldn't notice. There is a Robust menu for customizing your sound with many features found in higher end receivers. The remote is a little cheesy, as most are lately. I'm using it in a smaller home theater in my bedroom. Main/only home theater use would be fine, plenty of power and way better than the receivers that are in most "canned" systems (all in one's). Good receiver/great price (approx. two hundred dollar range).
0	My third POS Sony...: The left rear surround died after 2 years soon followed by both front speakers. Complicated setup, heat sensitive. Give it a pass. This is my third and last Sony product I will ever buy. I've got a '70s era Pioneer in the shop that runs forever, I think I'll give them a shot this time.
0	Worst receiver I have ever bought: Mine lasted all of 2 years and now it has stopped working. Up until now, I have never had a receiver last less than 7 years, so I am a little peeved. I ordinarily have good luck with Sony products, so I am fairly disappointed that this receiver died so soon. And FYI, I keep all of my electronics on surge protectors...
1	This book is well written: This book is well written. I love the details of the history of Seven Oaks. It does include some pictures which help to illustrate of a time and place long lost.
0	BEWARE! Pan and scan DVD: These two movies are not Conway's best, but they are still pretty good. The only problem, and the reason for the1 star rating, is that the DVD presents these films with the sides cut off. In other words, Pan and scan. Had I know that, I would not have bought this.
1	Great Movie: In received my video very fast. I love doing business with Amazon. I never had any problems with them. The movie is great if you like Tim Conway. I love the old movies. They are classic to me. So you should enjoy the movie if you enjoy him.

0	Not so good: Bad, It really couldn't catch my attention. So so acting and not so good effects. The plot has been overdone.
0	"But what are her chances?!": This movie is great to watch if you're having a bad movie night with snarky friends. As a serious movie, it's a joke. The acting is atrocious, the effects are beyond cheap, and the plot *rolls eyes*. But like I said, it's good for a laugh especially on a bad movie night.
1	Another Supreme Vampire title!: this one is good very good in fact! imagine vampires came forward and revealed themselves to the world (only about 4500 world wide) sun does not harm them they are allergic to silver (umm werewolves eh sheesh) and beheading is fatal its a modern future that looks decayed such as ww3 took place (in london no less lol) but the explanation of vampires as an evolutionary step rather then supernatural was refreshing for a change yes they can climb walls yes they drink blood and yes they are super strong ( as demonstrated in the video of vampires showing themselves lifting something not so light hehe)4 of 5 stars only one star loss for being a little talkie but theres enough action and vampire action to make this film a must own to any true vampire fan!
0	a million thumbs down: I only gave this movie one star because there wasn't an option for NEGATIVE 5 stars, but since I did give it one star that star goes to the pseudo 'special effects' (split screen, going backwards, speeding up) which is the only plus about the move. The rest of it tanked, big time. The plot was numb, the characters numb, the acting from some seemingly talented young hot stars was numb. Overall, this movie made my brain go numb. The voice overs were nauseating! Yeah all those things happen to teens in college, but they went a little overboard.It was really bad and I didn't realize it was a Sundance movie, otherwise I would have been a little more prepared.The only treat was looking at the cute gay guy named Paul. Shannon Sossamon was the only stand out 'performance' if there had to be one.DO NOT BUY OR RENT THIS MOVIE...!
0	When the movie ended the fun began: Seriously, the best part of this movie is when the credits roll. That's when Erasure's "STOP!" kicks in, a raucous song that will have you up and on your toes.I tuned in and out of this movie when it was on HBO, it never really held my attention. Sure there were some cute actors and actresses who were stripping down now and then but the whole movie was just bizarre. I kept watching though because I was bored. Finally this piece of junk ended and my favorite band started singing.Instead of buying this, just go buy any one of Erasure's great albums instead. More bang for your buck.
0	Awful: Spend your money for some other DVD. If you're interested in watching this movie, just rent it.
0	where are the rules?: Simplicity of it... the first of 45 minutes of it was intriguing, then it just falls apart.
1	Quite Possibly ...: This has to be the best, or one of the best pieces of cinematography that I have ever seen. The spit shot scene, the numerous shots of time fast-forwarding and rewinding, the multiple character thought patterns, all help to add this to my favorites list. I am very impressed with the well thought out characters, extraordinary dialogue, and character motivation. If you haven't seen this movie I recommend that you do it's an excellent piece of movie magic.
1	Excellent book: The book is composed of different events that happened in the author's life. It is the life of an Armenian immigrant family in the beautiful San Juaquin Valley. Although, the story is about events that are happening in a particular Armenian family, in reality it is the life all immigrants in America. The stories some how effects all Americans. I am positive that some where in our lifetime we were criticized for a certain cultural trait. It is the story of the ultimate underdog who is determined to succeed. At the same time it is a very fun and easy book to read. I could not put the book down.Saroyan has to be the best writer to come out of the West. He should have been recognized more for his genius work.
0	Really Sad!: I remember the first time I heard Nelly, it was back in1999/2000. I am sad to see great musicians fold under the weight of the music industry. She sold-out big time and will never be the same. The album title is very appropriate as she is nothing more than American sex appeal and MTV. I miss the music...
0	GWEN'S LEFT OVERS: I bought this album cuz it was on sale for $7 bucks. It ONLY has 3 good tracks: Maneater, Promisuos,& No Hay Igual. The rest of the album is boring and unexciting. This album sounds like Gwen Stefani's left over from LOVE, ANGLE, MUSIC, BABY.
0	a Corperate Broke attempt at Gwen Stefani: sine Nelly Furtado's last album basically went Reynolds Wrap here in the states the Record Company was like we gotta get you some grooves,lets get Timberland. Timberland during the mid to late 90's hit his peak as a Beat-Maker,but never really added anything to himself beyond beats&he eventually fell out of Groove. Nelly Furtado is now forced to play catch up with Gwen Stefani in a attempt at a Accessible sound&style that while has a minute or two coolness,loses it's appeal rather sooner than later. vocally she is a lightweight. her best attempts at coming back are on places where Timberland can't be found.this is only her 3rd release&the record company already is pushing her to being a Gwen Stefani Clone. the irony is that Nelly is more comfortable in this style than what I heard on Gwen's Solo Album,but on the real neither album made much of a impression on me on a whole.
0	A little catchy, pretty disappointing: It's more grown up than her previous albums in bad way. I can't play a few of the songs with my kids around. While the inappropriate songs may be catchy, it's disappointing that they had to be so "give it to me". It's also missing the "rap/yodeling/soul" stuff that made me like her so much in the first album.
0	What a sell out!: I loved Nelly Furtado's cd Folklore. But what I used to love about Nelly Furtado was that she prided herself in her music... not bumping and grinding with Justin Timberlake. Why does nearly every single famous female feel the need to suddenly become a sex image? She's a gorgeous girl and she doesn't need to sport a baby tee to prove it. For that reason alone, I can't see myself purchasing her cd despite her talent in music.
1	whatchutalkinbout?: people are saying nelly sold out and changed but why? She was always a little bit of r&b and hip hop anyways beneath all those folk tunes. She was in a hip hop group before her first album, cited mary j blige as one of her favourite artists(queen of hip hop soul), duetted with missy and did turn out the lights which sounded hip hop. Stop messing around with nelly just cause you don't have the talent she does for songwriting and being able to switch genres and looking damn beautiful all the time! What's also great about this Cd is that she's having mass appeal reaching out to blacks, whites, europeans, asians etc. and people off all ages from mothers to teenagers to college kids. and this isn't something every single artist out there is able to do. My hat goes off to this chick for kicking booty this summer!
1	Plain and simple: YOU NEED THIS CD!!I have been waiting a long long time for another N. Furtado album and it was honestly worth the wait. Granted it's completely different from her previous work (which are also great) but its ok for artist to change, evolve, and simply play around with other forms of music. Honestly, I perfer to listen to artist who are willin to take chances and try different things because I know I'll be entertained. This cd is crack from beginning to end.CAUTION: May be addicting.
1	Cold War Fun: I hadn't seen this movie since I was a kid and when my Dad recommended getting this I was glad you did because it is so funny. The humour is still fresh despite the cold war being over. A movie like this could never work today but its still good clean fun.
1	movie: I wanted a copy of this movie because my husband is in it.I haven't watched it to the end yet, so I hope he is in the credits.Came quickly,good condition.
1	Classic movie!: Been looking for this movie on DVD for years. One of the all time classic comedies. Comedic timing perfect! Not your "action packed" comedy, but nonetheless a star-studded classic. Put on par with the original "Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World."
1	The Russians Are Coming, The Russians Are Coming: A very entertaining film made during the cold war. There are numerous humorous scenes that typifies a New Englander, from the town drunk who envisioned himself as reinacting Paul Revere's famous ride to the old Veteran who thought he should organize a militia to protect the city from what was viewed as an impending attack by Russians who only wanted to find a way to get themselves back to sea. I think it is well done. Alan Arkin does a great job portraying a Russian officer who is frustrated with his Captain.
0	the movie is great, but the two on dvd i received are NOT coded for the USA!!!: this is suppose to be a multi-national, coded dvd, but 2 for 2 were rejected by my new dvd player. i then placed both into my lap-top and a message displayed that 2/5 codes worked while 3 were inactive (USA, being1/3 inactive codes). so, don't purchase this dvd unless you watch it on your computer online. HOWEEVER, the movie is excellent!!! it is totally clean, comical, with some drama, romance, and warmth of humanity. so i have cept one of the 'not coded for the USA' copies for my laptop, because i cannot get it anyother way apparently. NOT EVEN FROM AMAZON!
0	Mail Order Ties...: I can't recommend ordering ties on line--or at least, from this vendor. Tie was not Navy--it was ROYAL blue. Plus, the stitching started falling apart after 2 uses.
0	Mixed feelings: So I feel weird about this book. I am down with Montessori "schooling", but this book didn't give me anything new, in fact most of it was pretty dated. And much of the theory was very common sense, such as how to show your child how to do something, I was like "um...yeah, no kidding". Also, I don't know if this is because it is so dated(40's?) but many of the tasks for "3 to 5" year olds my11/2 year old can do, or is already learning, I felt like much of the things this book guides you to show your two year old, my bobbler already gets. There is even a part where it suggests we start teaching colors at age 3, my kid knows all his colors even though he can't say them. I am not bragging here, it was just weird. Also the "busy board" is put together with upholstery tacks, and I am pretty sure I wouldn't want my kid playing with something that included tacks.There was NOTHING here that I couldn't find on Montessori sites, or mom blogs.
1	Excellent addition to your collection: I collect action figures and when I saw these I immediately thought they were the most original action figure I've seen in a long time. They are fun to assemble they have a good number of variants coming out and they are completely interchangeable. In fact the website even encourages you to make your own parts and to paint them. They are capable of providing hours of fun for anyone from 8 to 60+.
0	disapointed 8 year old: My son bought the green and tan stikfas. First he was disapointed that there was only one figure. He'd imagined a number to set up a battle. At this price that is unlikely. (Maybe this is a creative toy for grown ups in there early 20's with lots of money.) He built it, searched the web site, did an experimental bit of decorating and left it on the dining room table for a week. They are currently living in a zip lock bag.
0	Very Disappointed!: I was looking forward to getting this book. Well, I just got it in the mail and am extremely disappointed with the information. Many of the towns I am very familiar with because I have either visited or done research on my own. The bottom line with this book is this: the information is not just old it is "very old"! Save your money, buy a different book, or just do internet searches. I wish I had.
0	Buy the green stuff instead -_-: It doesn't seem to matter how much I press the edge in to the surface, I just canNOT get a clean paint edge with this tape. It was only super important to have a perfect line on one wall (accent color), and I can't even get that one wall out of this tape. I've done touch up about 4 times, and it's not even a big wall!The only reason I didn't give1 star is that this is the "delicate surfaces" tape, and it DID come off more readily than the regular blue tape. I'm working over fairly old molding in places, and the regular tape left gunk, and took up the finish - this kind did NOT damage the molding at all.
0	Doesn't work as well as original: I recently put in bamboo flooring on my stairs and needed to paint the sides of the stairs where they were scuffed during installation. I used this "Delicate tape", which didn't do anything like a painters tape should. It didn't stay put and was constantly curling up at the corners, the paint seeped through onto the new stairs. Lastly it actually removed a lot of stain (stained black by manufacturer) from the floor boards.Don't bother with the fancy tape names. Stick with the original. I can only assume that Scotch found a way to skimp on the glue and called it "delicate".As a side note, I bought two of the other "New Styles" of tape, one which was supposed to keep lines crisp and straight. It did neither. It was worse than the Frog Tape, which doesn't live up to its name either.I hope this review is helpful for others. There is nothing I hate more than touch up work when painting, and this tape, and the whole new line from my experience, creates a lot of touch up.
1	Running Blind ( Jack Reachger no 4): I always enjoy the Jack reacher series. They are easy read and always keep you gussing. Jack always comes out on top. Too bad he can't settle down with a good woman.
1	uncanny: like the way he fiqures out the truth, lots of action. always getting himself in danergous situations. Great character, well written
1	Gripping: I am now on my fourth (in a row) Jack Reacher novels by Lee Child who manages to combine hard action, originality and excellent storyline twists which keep you guessing right to the last page. Thoroughly recommended.
1	Good book: It was a very good book! I cant wait for the next book in the series. Reacher at his best.
0	Not the best Reacher: An interesting idea for a crime spree, but this is one padded story with a fairly predictable "twist", especially as Reacher books go. And there are some scenes that make almost ZERO sense. If you're a Reacher addict, you'll read it anyway. If you're not, save your time and money.
0	Horrible: I hated this. Read the first Reacher book a couple of weeks ago, absolutely loved it and got completely hooked. Just finished Reacher #5 and about to download 6.If you ask me, the first two are stunning (5* masterpieces), #3 is good but not as good (different feel to it but still interesting, 3-4*), but this was horrible. The CIA came across as completely unbelievable, the 'twist' was visible a mile off, and the whole thing was based on a flawed premise (SPOILER: hypnosis just doesn't work like that).Five was better but also flawed (3*?).The first two were so good that I am going to plod on, however. Hope the series gets back on track.[this reminds me of the John Rain books, where the first two are stunning and then the whole thing gets tired fast once he leaves Japan and gets his annoying sidekicks...]
0	This IS 'Running Blind': This is the same book as 'Running Blind'. If you own that title,(good book, by the way), don't waste your money on this.
1	Running Blind (Jack Reacher No. 4): I thought the ending was a bit "flat" compared to the first three Jack Reacher books. Also, I thought the degree to which the FBI tried to set Reacher up stretched believability and necessity. However, all in all I have enjoyed the Jack Reacher books and will purchase future titles.
1	Good who and "how" dunnit. Keeps you guessing.: Great dialogue and keeps you guessing until the end. Although it is an earlier Jack Reacher novel, it shows that high tech and CGI are not necessary to make a good exciting story.
1	good read: Just past the middle of it. Not as much violence as the other books but it has more curves in the plot than JLO... If you dislike the FBI, than you will love how Jack screws around with them.
0	dvd does not play: I was very excited to get this movie on dvd which did arrive very promptly. Unfortunately, this disk from Movie Mars will not play on my dvd player. When I press play, the message CANNOT PLAY is displayed. I have ordered many dvds from Amazon and have never had this problem.
0	3 Defective Phones from ATT and Counting: I ordered this phone form Cingular (ATT) and today my third defective phone came in the mail. A customer service rep told me that 85% of all her returns and exchanges come from this model phone. The first phone had a handset speaker that didn't work and the next 2 were, in the words of the customer service rep, "DOA" -- dead on arrival. It would be a really nice phone if it worked though...
0	How can a phone not have an ear bud jack??: The phone itself is pretty good, feels comfy in the hand and the bottons protrude and "click" so it gives nice tactile feedback, something missing from almost every phone on the markey. So you know what you're pressing at all times, almost no texting errors.However, two flaws, and one of them is MAJOR.1. How can a phone not have an input for an earbud? This is absolutely unacceptable, and I've never seen a phone in the last 6-7 years not have a simple ear bud jack, ridiculous! This is the sole reason I returned mine, as I do not care for Bluetooth, I prefer simple corded earbuds as they are cheap to replace if lost.2. Another pretty serious flaw is the battery. It is rated at 3 hours, but that is pushing it.Overall this could have been a great phone, but two pretty stupid, unthinkable mistakes like not including a basic earbud jack ruins it.
1	Functional and Fairly Durable: I received this hamper as a baby shower gift and then turned around and purchased one to give to a friend for her baby shower. It's quite attractive and available in several nice colors. Since it doesn't scream "baby," it maintains its usefulness over the years, and folds up into a nice slender package when not in use. The durability of the inner mesh lining is my only issue. I've had to repair the cloth loops a couple of times when I tried to haul heavy loads - but the repairs were simple (I'm no seamstress, so it was REALLY simple) and the hamper is still functional after three years of use.
1	Java Programming with Oracle SQLJ - above average: My knowledge of Oracle and Java is beginner/intermediate level and I like this book a lot.The book explains how SQLJ relates to SQL, PL/SQL, Java, JDBC and it provides a good introduction to the JDeveloper IDE (Integrated Development Environment).The book is written very clearly and the appearance and organization of the text is well up to the O'Reilly standard.I can't comment on the worked examples yet as I have not yet tried them out.
0	Awful Fake Compilation BEWARE!: The music is not by the original artist. Like buying bad Karioke. Very misleading.
1	A history of a major Wall Street bank and more.: When in1976 Jerome Kohlberg, Henry Kravis, and George Roberts left Bear Stears to form KKR, Wall Street realized these three dealermakers might become a major force in the restructuring of American big business then beginning. What could not be predicted was the heights KKR would achieve. It has risen from the ranks of upstarts to become a major player in "The New Establishment." While KKR has been the subject of other books and articles, none could be considered "definitive," as is "The New Financial Capitalists." It is more than a history of a bank, however. Baker and Smith have addressed the problem posed by the separation of ownership and management delineated in1934 by Adolph Berle and Gardner Means in "The Modern Corporation and Private Property," indicating how the leveraged buyout programs of the1980s helped resolve it.
0	Does not fit!: Nicely constructed but does not fit my 2002 Oldsmobile Silhouette. The description "For GM 87-05" is too vague.
0	Wouldn't Recomend to Anyone: Bought it for my 2003 Pontiac Sunfire. Hooked all the necessary wires up, disassembled the dash and popped out the radio, only to find that the harness DID NOT EVEN CLOSELY RESEMBLE the factory harness. If one is looking for sheer disappointment, have at it. Buy it in bulk then. Heck, go ahead and tell your kid Santa isn't real while your at it. Whatever tickles the ole pickle.
1	I never ordered this but get to review it anyway!: Gotta love the internet, I never purchased this item but love to review things. How is that any different than professional sports I will never know. Semper fi, never been in the military either......
1	Metra Harness: I LOVE Metra products!!!!!!!!!!!!They make installing a stereo SUPER easy,allows you to solder all the connections easily in your workshop or kitchen or wherever your good lady permits you to work,then you can makesure you have a sturdy and safe set of connections,remember the vehicle is either the family transport,or the way you get to work,go out in with friends,so why risk a car fire and a pile of plastic crap on the floor where your carpet once was.Spend the extra $$$$ its really worthwhile................if you need to speak with Metra they are very helpful
0	Well....not quite what I anticipated: This bag was going to be for me to use at college, and quite frankly it was WAY too small for that. It is more made for elementry to middle school kids. So luckily I have a little sister to give it to, but otherwise, I'm pretty disappointed.
0	why do people like this so much?: It is really low quality and the straps are uncomfortable.I bought it for my daughter If I had seen it before I would not buy it. I think it is not good for a child. Because comfort is more important for them than adults.I will not return it but will not use for school.I am very disappointed.It is like a joke!!!
1	Simple, good backpack: This backpack is everything a backpack should be; simple, functional, and well-fitting. I would undoubtedly buy it again, although it seems as though it will be holding up for a long time to come.
0	This looks nothing like it does in the picture . Very misleading: I got excited when i came across this bag because of the colour and when i received it i was very disappionted the colour is nothing like the one in the picture and i am so not happy with this bag .
1	hannah montana clock: my daughter loves this clock. She's 7 and wanted to start waking up by herself. It works!
1	jansport backpack: It's a great book bag. Very roomy, and sturdy. The pattern is pretty: young teens adore it!! Price is fair for this item.
1	JanSport backpack a hit: Great backpack! My son goes through them like you would not believe. This time, I think he'll have no choice but to make this one last!
1	Perfect!: I've used Jansport backpacks for years and the quality is great. I wanted to find a rare color so I purchased it in Light Purple Passion and love it! The color was slightly different as I thought the strap/padding part of it was black but it turned out to be a dark violet & the strings to the zipper were striped not solid. Even though it wasn't the same as shown (not really a good thing) I ended up liking it better than the sample picture.
1	High School Backpack: I especially love the color of this backpack, it is very cute, however since this backpack only has two pockets it does not have a lot of space for textbooks. Other than the space issue it is a very nice backpack.
1	receive faster than i expected: The product is nice and I got it faster than I expected. Very nice purchase experience!
0	Bag is here as it is but the fabric is cut from the top.: I received my bag and it looks exactly like i wanted it. Problem is it's cut like someone has used a knife or razor to cut it a whole 5cm cut on the top of the bag. This is not what i really imagined to get.
1	It's fresh!: My bag has remained fresh since its still wrapped in plastic, but everyone should know what to expect from Jansport bags: durability, comfort and versatility.
0	light duty backpack: Purchased it for junier high school student. it's not big enough and also you can not image how large it actually will be. Overall, it's low cost and low quality bag and you can buy it at local sports authority cheaper and easy to return or change it if you don't like it after receiving. Will not buy those bag anyway.
1	Great Backpack!: Great Backpack! Love the color! The only thing, is that it gets dirty easily. I got a pen mark on the pocket, and I'm not sure how to remove it :(
1	"Kim...hits the spot": I remember years ago, riding on a bus, listening to the radio. "Kim the Waitress" came on and I was blown away by what an excellent song this was. The feel of the song, as well as the instruments used during it were absolutely intriguing. The fact that such simple lyrics can be transformed into such a revolutionary ballad is inspiring! So anyhow, years went by and I became content with the fact that I would never pin down the artist of this wonderful song. But...I did. And I listened to the rest of this brilliant cd, and was blown away by it as as well. Go figure!
0	Not up to the standards of the first two LPs!: Freak City Soundtrack finds our Chicago lads getting a little too close to their Marshall stacks - The Jesus & Mary Chain would be jealous of the feedback that permeates this record.For those who thought International Pop Overthrow was a little too candy-coated, you'll definitely get your fill of crunchy guitars on this one.The late Jim Ellison does a great job of taking the pi** out of "guitar gods" with his one-note solo during "Help Me Land."Still, I'd try IPO or DU (if you can find them) before FCS. Why these MI CDs go out of print in under five years while record companies continue to churn out copies of fossils like "The Best Of Cat Stevens" is beyond me.
0	Static in My Ears is more like it: I'm all for giving local bands a chance and that's exactly what State of Being is, a local Cleveland band. And that's about as far as SOB is ever going to get by writing songs like this. If you enjoy thin sounding music created with Casio keyboards and lyrics that are reminiscent of sixth grade theatrics, then you'll more than likely enjoy the tracks on this disc. I had a problem just getting past the weak and monotone vocals.This disc did absolutely nothing for me. Other than make me wish that I were deaf.On a positive note, the lead singer is kinda cute.
0	Stuck in old Testament: I always liked Davids first books and was looking forward to reading the 2 end times books he wrote but his proof text is all old Testament and has NOTHING to do with America in fact the verses he used was spoken by the prophets for Israel only and not the Church. It has taken a real strong man to do what he has in the past sometimes just him and God but now that he older the same conviction of his teaching are making him unteachable and I fear just stuck in his own ideals. If you really want to know what going to happen to the world just stick to reading the book of Revelation. I threw his 2 books on the end times in the trash can so no one would be miss lead by them.
0	Sad, Sad.....: Mr. Wilkerson is, as far as I can tell, a decent and sincere Christian man. This book, however, is a strange trip into whacko-land!The Bottom Line: This book is full of "prophecies" that are obviously false. Time has been cruel to the Pastor's prognostications. Big thumbs down.
1	LOVE IT!!: Am very limited in what I can eat, and this product is a definite keeper. Is easily and very quickly prepared. Left-overs store very nicely, and this is yet another product I cannot find where I live, so am doubly grateful that Amazon carries this.
0	In a nutshell: This book was recommended reading during my studies on interior design, so I bought it without really looking into it. I was disappointed. Maybe I expected too much, maybe the title misled me, but it seemed very much based on thumbnail sketches and it wasn't what I was looking for. It is a thin little book full of rough pencil sketches that you could easily lose down the back of the sofa! (in a nutshell). I wanted to know the more indepth technical ways of doing perspectives and this book left me in the dark.
1	Plugged it in ... Next thing I know I am Connected.: Install the drivers, shut down, plug it in, boot back up and Windows knows right where the drivers are. Then suddenly it's installed and I am connected to my router. After being connected I went in and configures WEP to work and all those fancy things.I like this card and was surprised at how easily and quickly I was connected with a nice strong signal. My desktop is upstairs, but the wireless access point is downstairs. This card still gets a good signal.
0	Careful: Will Freeze Up Your Machine: My experience is like a lot of others - I bought this unit with high expectations for good performance but found that it would regularly freeze up my machine. When I removed the offending unit the freezes were gone as well. Additionally, the installation manual had erroneous information in it. Ask yourself what kind of company would put out an untested product like this and still forge ahead with a clear conscience, and that just about sums up D-Link. I would recommend LinkSys or any other vendor until D-Link improves the quality, dependability, and reliability of their products.
0	One of the worst films I&#65533;ve ever seen: When Snipes is playing in a film, I'll routinely pick it up, confident that it won't be bad and might be terrific --- he's done some great stuff. Sadly, this film is an unbroken string of cliche laden dialogue, actions and plot lines. I watched it for 25 minutes before going to Amazon's Reader's Reviews, which is what I usually do before taking out a film. If I had done so, it would have saved me some money and 25 minutes of my time. Mystery Science Theater 2000's Robot and Servo would have had a field day with this flick. It's bad enough to get their undivided attention.
0	Snipes can do better!: This movie is a rip-off of many other action movie...It felt like a little bit of Mission Impossible with a pinch of Enemy of the State thrown in. Wesley Snipes stars as a U.N. spy, a very typical character in these James Bond style movies of one man takes on dozens, and wins. The plot is as difficult to follow as it is thin. The film centers around the concept that the U.N. is trying to build itself up as a major world power by framing people for the assasinations of heads of state. The movie does not spend enough time to develop this plot and thus leaves the viewer distracted from the action. Throughout the movie, you are presented with a small list of people for the "who-done-it" style ending, which I'm sorry to say was very predictable. Overall, this film is worth watching on cable, but I personally would not pay the money to rent or buy it.
0	Absolutely Terrible: I love Wesley Snipes, I have enjoyed many of his movies, but this is one is really really bad. It is painful to watch this film, if you can even call it that. The only part of this movie I found cool was the credit sequence at the beginning and the opening shot. The rest of this movie is a pile of cliches, with no purpose. The action sequences are very mediocre, with nothing new being shown. The dialogue in this movie is where this movie gets hurt very badly. The plot is ok, but if the dialogue had been sharper this movie could of at least been watchable. The one-liners made me cringe. The conversations between the characters is the same old, same old. This movie is completely unwatchable, and I recommend you don't watch as it will destroy your respect for Wesley, which no one want to happpen.
0	WTF: I am very, very, very confused as to how this movie is getting an average of 3.5 stars.Now I can understand that some aspects of a cluttered film like this one can be appealing to some but I have no clue as to how somebody could derive enjoyment from the plot. The movie played like a broken record: nick cage would complain (in a voice over) about his fat balding body, his brother (also nick cage) would talk for awhile then main character nick cage would try an aspect of the story and end up masterbating.This must have happened five or six times in the film with parts about the wirting of the book that this crap movie is based on. I don't see how the production studio could get away with the plot they used. They portrey the actual writer of the book (a very real person) as a insecure, ugly, drug attic who tries to kill the brothers (It's a shame she coulden't didn't succeed sooner).In Conclution this movie was a piece of sh**. save yourself some money and skip this one.
0	Where to start?: This movie was so slow and long. Once you finally reach the last 45 minutes, you have reached the best part of the whole movie. Just let this movie run while you are busy doing something else.
0	More Hollywood Schlock: Yet another braindead, hollow, formulaic Hollywood concoction with the standard ingedients: load up on bankable stars, throw tons-o-money at it, pump up the "buzz" and voila!, another Hollywood blockbuster.I can't believe all the hype surrounding this movie. An inane script with absolutely nothing important to say about anything. And what's with all the buzz surrounding the Kaufman's? You'd think they were the Next Coming the way critics go on and on about their supposed brilliance. It amazes me to see how much praise is bestowed upon writers whose only strength is their cleverness. As if being clever constitutes great screenwriting. Does "Memento" ring a bell?
0	Quite possibly the worst movie I've ever seen: I have attempted to watch this movie twice. After getting part way through it both times, longer through the second time just to force ourselves to give it more of a chance, we shut it off due to the fact that we were so incredibly bored.I have absolutely no understanding of what any of you, who liked it, see in this movie. Perhaps it gets better, but when over half of the movie is dead, I don't see how it could.
0	Might be the only one but I hated it.: From reading the other reviews it seems that everyone else loved this film more than I did. I wanted to leave the cinema (two of my friends did) when I went to see it. I found the story between Meryl Streep and Chris Cooper well acted and touching but I was irritated by the parts of the film that featured Nicolas Cage's character, Charlie. For me it was almost as if he was getting in the way and I left the cinema with the distinct impression that I would have enjoyed it much more if I had simply read the book.
0	Over-rated, lame-arsed-pomo dreck...: Well, at least Kaufman seems to know that he can't write a third act to save his (or his fictional brother's) life. The emperor is officially desnudo, my friends.
0	don't be fooled, this movie is TERRIBLE!!!!!!!!!: like many unfortunate souls out there, i had heard how great adaptation was, blah blah blah. i rented it and proceeded to utterly waste two hours of my life. i'm writing this for one reason only: to try to stop you from doing the same. believe me, even bill and ted's is a better film. this movie is pathetic.
0	Worst Movie Ever: This movie was BY FAR the worst movie I have EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE, that is not an exaggeration. When I saw it, I went for free to the Sneak preview screening compliments of my local radio station, so I didn't actually waste any money on this atrocity (thank the gods). However, It was so utterly bad that I felt I had still been wronged for having wasted my TIME having gone. In addition, this movie has in fact ruined Nicholas Cage for me FOREVER, I cannot take him seriously anymore. The worst mistake he ever made was agreeing to make this movie. If I had a copy, I would not sell it, I would BURN IT!!!
0	watch something else: Nicolas Cage is brilliant in his interpretation(s) but I can't understand how this movie can get 5 stars... it is boring boring boring and quite ridiculous in some scenes.
0	This is horrible: I'm sorry, there is something very sick about this CD. These kids have absolutely no talent and sing about things like insects stealing your food. Whoever created this CD has made a mockery of "mentally challenged" kids everywhere. I tried as hard as I could not to laugh at this, but....I'm afraid it's impossible
1	Fast Music From Slow Kids: The next time Bono or Scott Weiland whine about how being a rock star is some sort of elitist job, I want to huck one of these kickass CDs into their heads and kill them. As for the band, all I can say is wow.
0	What a Joke: I have to say that I don't feel I need to say this music is good because these kids are retarded. I laugh every time i listen to this. I feel bad for the people with normal mentality who produce it and play the instruments for these kids. HILARIOUS. All the people who say its good are probably just a bunch of single white females with no lives who complain about everything and blame violence on t.v and video games.This CD sucks. But it gets me laughing
0	THE MUSIC KINDA BLOWZ: It just wasn't good i do better sometimes it was funny though so maybe it's worth buyin you know!
1	Peony: Bought this book to read for book club. It is very interesting and believable. The club enjoyed it as well.
1	Awesome Access Point with 802.11g speeds: This AP has some good quality features. Filtering, WEP, soon WPA, and more. I have this plugged into my 4 port router and now I can access the Internet with my laptop and DWL-G650 (wireless adapter for laptop). These two products give me great range (throughout the house, and even outside), good security, and a reliable wireless connection. This is all I need for a small price.
1	Fantastic!: Beautiful Music! Its like a magical evening with pitch perfect angels singing to you! I highly endorse this! 2 thumbs up!
0	DONT READ!!!!: This book is the downer of the century. Just when you think something is going to happen BAM!!!! the book is over. I accidently finished the book. Thats pathetic! Most fiction has a rising action that is not present in this book. Its a great book about nothing.
0	If I believed in burning books, this would be the only one I'd torch: This stands as the longest work of "literature" I have ever been forced to read. Not due to the page count, as it is actually rather (mercifully) short; it is merely the most monotonous and plodding work of fiction ever published, in any language. When I read the book, I had hoped for a punchline - at some point the story would actually take form and progress. Instead, I felt as though I had been accosted by one of those people who insist on showing you their boils and bunions while you are trying to eat your lunch. Its only merit is that it is a prime example of what aspiring writers should NEVER produce. If this book were distributed in Guantanamo, Amnesty International would object, and rightly so. This is the pinnacle of academic torture, and those who assign it should be investigated, very closely.
0	Awful Literature: I'd give this book0 stars if possible, it was a horrendous read, a truly awful book that is forced upon high schoolers everywhere.
0	Not Suggested for the Clinically Depressed: And if you're not currently among the ranks of the depressed, you will be after reading this novel. Seriously, I did not find the novel either a) beautiful or b) worth reading. Perhaps it would have been very moving in a tragic sense if I had bought any of Wharton's feeble attempts at painting a story of forbidden love gone wrong. The novel entirely lacked any real connection with human emotions and behaviors. Perhaps, if the storyline of the book were my life, it would depress me very much. The pointlessness and ironic misfortune of these characters lives is remarkable, but I was left feeling too apathetic to be upset by this fact. I do not suggest you torture yourself by reading this novel, unless you have a flair for masochism.
0	Wharton gets her point across: If I were to use four words to review this book, they would be: "thank goodness it's over". I did not enjoy this book at all. With her tale of loneliness and a tragic "lovers' pact" set in the cold and unforgiving New England snow, Edith Wharton attempts to draw us, the readers, into the black pit of despair known as her life. She succeeds marvelously. _Ethan Frome_ is a prime example of how literature can effectively evoke emotion. Wharton was an unhappy woman, and while reading her book, I was unhappy as well. Even though his story is tragic, one cannot sympathize with Frome; he has suffered for most of his life and will continue to suffer for the rest of his life, but his own choices took him there. I recommend staying very far away from this novella.
0	Ethan Frome: It's classics like this one that discourage me from reading classics! and if I have to come up with additional words: here they are!
0	AWFUL, BORING, DONT READ!: I decided to read this book after seeing it on a list of supposed classics and the positive reviews here on amazon. Boy do i regret it.I am now wondering what is the criteria for labeling a book "classic" because i can not appreciate ANYTHING from this book. Watching paint dry would be a better way to pass the time.I'm also starting not to trust the postive reviews on Amazon since this the second time i've been burned by you guys (Huxley's "Island" also sucked)
0	The WORST book in the history of ink!!!: ... Ethan Frome is a worm with no backbone who was afraid to stand up to his overbearing wife. Period!! The story is irrelevant to life in the 21st century. If you are unhappy in a marriage you'd get a divorce. ... This is one book that actually DISCOURAGES people from reading. After reading this piece of garbage you'll wish you were illiterate!!.
0	Times have changed: When Edith Wharton wrote "Ethan Frome," long, long passages of exposition were perfectly acceptable fiction. That's changed. No one who doesn't have to read this book will read it. A pity; they'll miss out on Wharton's lucid and luminous prose. But for today's reader, it's a dull, dry book.
0	How BORING!: This book was so detailed - i don't know how someone could drag out a 48 hour period of time into 9 chapters. Very detailed and drawn out. If you dont have to read it don't.
1	Wonderful reference!: It is really a shame this book is out of print! I have had my students read it for in-depth, inner knowledge of the Supreme Court. It is a book that holds the interest of the reader whike giving factual information about our highest court. Now I must find some sort of alternative, equally as intriguing. I truly wish the publisher would consider returning the book to print!
0	I tried hard but I failed: It may not be fair for me to rate this book as I was not able to finish it. I even thought of just deleting it from my book list - that's how I don't like it. Tried to read it at different times of the day but I can't help but fall asleep over it, every time! Much as I hate to leave a book unfinished, this isn't just worth my time and effort. I won't mind if people will think of me as shallow, but in my opinion, deep subjects such as the one tackled in this book can be presented in a more interesting and engaging manner. Doesn't matter if she's a Nobel Prize winner, if this is her style, I don't think we'll ever click.
1	Sweet and depraverd: Saint Reverend Jen, partron saint of the uncool, makes the Lower East Side, tenement to the world, seem like shangrila. She has a way of making the depraved seem sweet and the bizarre seem like common sense. This guide may not tell you what beds Washington slept in, but it may tell you what beds you can.
1	Should be a good read: Hi! I'm a teenager that was in a small group (called a "D"-group) in which Wendy was my leader. She's a very gifted writer and a strong Christian, and her books are fun to read and interesting. I would definitely recommend it.
1	They don't make great classic movies like this any more !!!: Trail Of Robin Hood is a great movie with Roy Rogers and my favorite actresses is Penny Edwards. I feel all these movies need to come out into theatres again so people can take a step back in time to remember and see the greatest actors & actresses in the world.
1	Groovy, funky, out of control good!!!!: I purchased this album after hearing "slide" on download.com. That song is so slick that I assumed the rest of the cd must be good. I was right!!! Kind of reminds me of Vikter Duplaix meets Van Hunt. Got some r&b grooves, some dance/funky house. Some uncategorizable tracks as well but it is all nicely done.
1	Nice Booster!: This is a wonderful backless booster seat. Much more plush than most you find for sale. Light weight, comfy, and nice fun color. My daughter loves it!
0	$3 Bucks Down the Drain - Just Awful: I started the movie and could not get past the cheesy presentation or the music. Fast forwarded 7 min and the cheesy presentation was still going with the cheesy music and some cheesy person trying to speak over it. No way I could get through any more of it and turned it off. I generally wait until the end of a movie to give it a fair assessment. In this case I did not need to wait till the end; two minutes was as long as I could stand. Save your money!!!! TOTALLY TRASH
0	Volleygal: If I could leave zero stars, I would. I picked this up thinking it was de Palmas Dahlia- what a complete waste of time... I forwarded through most of it..not sure why...I guess I was hoping I hadn't wasted my money. Please don't encourage this guy to make any more movies...seriously, it was awful.
0	TERRIBLE, UNWATCHABLE GORE FEST: I also was unaware of the fact that there were 2 "versions" of the movie. I have to ditto other reviews. Horrified, my husband and I fast forwarded assuming this was some sort of dream sequence gone bad and the investigation would start up soon. Wrong. Just avoid this movie it is really awful.
0	Everybody Dies: John Cusack and Ray Liotta, amongst others, get lost in a motel in the middle of nowhere. It`s a rainy, obscure night, and suddently people start getting murdered for no apparent reason. As each character dies, the closer we are to descovering who the murderer is...This James Mangold`s thriller ("Girl, Interrupted", "Kate and Leopold") has a few nice twists and surprises, but the character development isn`t strong enough to make us care much and the multiple changes on the last part only make it worse. It has a suspenseful atmosphere, competent acting and neat direction, though the final result doesn`t step above average. A decent, schizophrenic thriller, but nothing great or terribly exciting. Watchable.
0	Ghostly Court: In reminiscence to Hitchcock's classic, a film tells of ten strangers staked and murdered at a motel, but presents an emphasis on mental conditions meeting something supernatural.I think combining weird with earthy is not a too clever attempt itself, adding a kind of round table court proceedings surely.What is realistic it is a completely inappropriate court order which reflects movie-makers own civic expertise probably.
1	wow - a film that's scary and smart at the same time: I wouldn't suggest seeing this movie more than once...unless you're looking for clues that give away the ending. However, I found that although this movie might've started out as a typical horror film, ...it dosn't end that way.
0	Lame Hitchcock Ripoff Wannabe: Even John Cusack can't save this. I expected to see something different. DO NOT BE FOOLED. This has been done before though some people believe it hasn't. This was a rip off of many Hitchcock stories as well as some horror films.PEOPLE GETTING BUMPED OFF AT RANDOM: Original...not!KILLER WITH MULTIPLE PERSONALITIES: Been there, seen that!A BUNCH OF PEOPLE STRANDED TOGETHER: What did they use a generic script?Maybe, just maybe I'd give an A for effort if this hadn't been so boring. This is definitely one of the most disappointing films I've seen. Nothing was original. The director and writers tried to imitate Hitchcock's brilliance and failed miserably. Word to the wise: DON'T MESS WITH THE MASTER.Skip this or you'll regret it. The only thing good about this film was Rebecca DeMornay. Even she couldn't rescue it.
1	PSA: Skip other guy's review below-it gives away the ending!: Public service announcement: If you haven't seen this movie yet, do not read the review below entitled "Seems interesting, IT'S NOT WHAT YOU THINK" as the mental midget who wrote it exposes the twist and gives away the ending. What a moron!By the way, the film isn't bad, but not great. Not as mind-bending as Memento or Usual Suspects, but better than many so-called thrillers floating around out there. As mentioned above though, the film does fail Psychology101.
0	Identity crisis: John Cusack is always great, Rebecca DeMornay's few minutes onscreen are well done, and Ray Liotta delivers as expected, but I'm really surprised they all agreed to work on this film. What a disappointment. Anytime you find yourself laughing when yet another character is murdered in some tired old horror movie fashion, it's time to hit the stop button. Even when you realize that everyone with a room key is going to die, it isn't suspenseful or even an issue because you don't really like them anyway, and they certainly don't care much about each other. The "plot twist" at the end is a total cop out and fairly predictable. (Wasn't it 20 years ago that Bobby dreamed an entire season of Dallas?) Maybe I would have enjoyed it more if I'd watched the alternative ending(s), but the final version was more than enough for me.
0	UMM.... WHAT CAN I SAY?: First off, was she her own editor? Because there were a lot of mistakes in this book, the more I read the madder I got. Most of the time the book didn't make sense. I paid way too much for this book and it was only100 some pages, and it didn't have any kind of meaning. I take that back the meaning of this book showed me that she was DUMB & STUPID AS HELL. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY. Buy Fly on the Wall by Trista Russell it's better and cheaper.
1	Buzz words and phrases: Back in the 70s this group became legend among musicians of every genre at the time. We found hundreds of ways to filter lines from these recordings into every day situations and never got tired of listening to this hilarious spoof that took every one of us back to the days of southern local radio shows that our parents listened to religiously in the 50s. Like all satire, it's not that much of a stretch from the reality of what those shows were really like. This is one of those moments in time that just can't and won't be duplicated ever again. A diamond in the rough, indeed.
1	Good ole' boys playin' for 'em good ole' boys: In the words of ole' Roadhog himself this record is "mighty fine". I heard these guys live when they opened for the Stafford Brothers and Mother Mayball Carter last Winter down to the Johnny Mack Brown Highschool gym and was imeadiately impressed. All I can say is buy as many copies of this country classic as you can get yer hands on before it goes out of print.Five stars jist aint enough, Thanks boys and keep on a'singin'
1	British Science Fiction At Its Best!: Watch a fine cast of English actors keep up stylish upper lips as they confront a mass impregnation by fierce aliens. It's the original film adaptation of the book "The Midwich Cuckoos."
1	I FEEL HER PAIN!: When I first heard this song I was startled! This song sounds like it really came from deep inside her heart. We've all been hurt my men in ourlives..and yes we all feel like SCREAMING "I HATE YOU SO MUCH RIGHT NOW! AHHHHHHHHHHHHHH! ..I SYMPATHIZE. Every time I hear her song I BLAST IT!..So I can hear her scream to her full extent. She is awsome! I recommend this to all women who have been deceived and lied to by men. Womens National Anthem!
0	Let's Tear Down This Wahl: HiI bought this shaver based on customer reviews,,So much for trusting anonymous reviews.. First of all it's cheaply made.....Motor is loud and slow compared to good shavers...had to glue charger together with super glue... one head on personal trimmer was broke.......poor quality shave even with the closest head it's not close.....takes15 hours of charging for a few minutes of shaving....If this truly is the last American made shaver it's a sad commentary on what we are turning out......Try a Braun Free Control for a foil Shaver or a Norelco for rotory and forget this junk.....well the first shave wasn't too bad and it's all down hill from there.
1	Great Selection: I have to say that I like Rhino and Varese Sarabande's CDs so much more that the slapped-together compilations that I find in the "cheap racks" at Tower (and other stores). This CD has a ton of great '80s hits on it...and the liner notes are really fact-filled, too. Get this and the Rhino New Wave CDs...you'll be set for your '80s fix!
1	We love it: I use it to decorate my sons's bedroom. There's not much dr Seus decorations stuffs on the market. But I did it with this and other stuffs and looks awesome. Ans my son loves his room.
1	Spice Girls In America Was An Awesome Documentary!: The Spice Girls new video is Girl Power packed, funny and entertaining all at the same time. It's like Spice World, but not scripted! This movie rocks!
0	never gonna come: well i ordered this and everything went good.well until they called me and said they were out of stock for at least 4-6 weeks.and in the status it said shipped but i guess it wasnt.and they still havent put out of stock on the page.so im trying to help u out of a month and a half wait.DONT BUY THIS!!!
1	AMAZING AIRSOFT GUN: I love this gun. I'm a new guy for airsoft and this gun help me so good.When I was fighting with my airsoft gun I bit evrybody in 4 seconds it's an AMAZING GUN.It's a good product.I think evrybody can buy this gu if you have money and I think a lotof people wish to have it.YOU CAN BUY IT.
0	Can only be used with full zoom: The E550 is a good camera and this lens does do a good job of zooming in on the subject but due to the way the camera and lens are designed, you must have the camera's zoom fully extended in order to use this tele lens. So this means if the subject is moving around a lot, such as my daughter playing soccer, you will miss the shots where the action has moved to close to you because you can't zoom out. As long as the action remains at some distance to you than this zoom lens is useful. I unfortunately have too many ruined shots because the action moved too close and their heads get cut off, etc.Another negative is that the viewfinder doesn't show the zoomed in image, you must use the lcd screen to frame a shot, which can be difficult in bright sunlight.
1	Pretty good: I liked this book. Precise, easy-to-follow, and a page turner. I'm interested by graphic design, and is Illustrator10 is one of vector programs. This book is recommended if you plan to know anything about the new version.
1	The Machanic: An excellant film shows Charles Bronson at his best the steely eyed hero out as usual to wow the watching public and as usual chooses a script to suit I think his rugged personality.Truly an actor pulling you through every twist and turn. I can thoroughly recommend this DVD as it is exciting all the way and you never know what the character is thinking before the next something else happens. A film though to watch I think on one of those rainy days with your popcorn, may be a bit slow in places but you need to get right into it to appreciate it. If you like the hitman type of film then this is it but it is not difficult sometimes to feel sorry for the victim.
0	Big Disappointment: Nice gimmick, but lousy story. The director is in love with the way he's telling this mediocre story and that sustains the movie for the first thirty minutes, but then tedium sets in. I'm glad he tried so hard to do something different, and that may make the movie worth seeing (ok, it's worth seeing briefly for being unique, but you'll get bored with it pretty quickly so have another movie handy to put in when this one starts putting you to sleep). There is mild fun in trying to piece all the elements together, but once you do there isn't anything interesting going on. People are giving this movie too much credit for telling its story from both the beginning and the end at the same time with an actual ending somewhere in the middle, and aren't giving it enough criticism for being just a simple minded and uninteresting story to begin with.
1	you people...hahahahahaha: you know, i always thought that people who review the flicks on a website were just people who are small inside, and wish to be big and important...and influence the daily lives of others like yourselves. but lately i have noticed that movies that are so good sometimes need to be reviewed about. wether it's an awesome flick or a piece of shizzah, you just want to talk about it. and yeah, it makes you feel like you're doing something...writing on the internet! being an influence on peoples movie tastes! woooo(...)! so exciting! THis movie was pretty good, and now i consider myself...one of you! NOT!
0	Overhyped & Overrated: I seem to be one of few in my opinion of this movie which is that it's not a good movie. I felt the movie was boring and lacking of a good plot. I bought the movie believing it was a really good movie based on what I had heard but was really disapointed once I watched the movie. This movie in my opinion is very overrated.
0	Clean Slate II: Remember the Dana Carvey comedy "Clean Slate"? if not you probably won't mind that Momento is the non-comedy version of this Dana Carvey dud. The plot is fine, the acting is fine, the backwards story isn't as good as the backward episode of Seinfeld, but still fun. Basically this movie got some good hype early on, and has been too ARTSY for anyone to disagree. Not a waste of money, but not nearly as fresh or clever or new as it would like to be. A solid movie borrowing heavily from other sources. If one is not familiar with these other works, I am sure Momento is compelling, on the other hand, anyone who watches TV or film regularly will be dissapointed.
0	A Wildly Overrated Film!!: I cannot believe how many people loved this film. It is grossly overrated. Discussions around this film center on its "groundbreaking" backwards structure. Well, there is a little known film from the early1980's called "Betrayal" starring Jeremy Irons and Ben Kingsley. It is a film about a love triangle that is told backwards. TV's Seinfeld did a riff on Betrayal with the Indian Wedding episode. So this film is hardly groundbreaking. As for the story, I found it boring. Yet another revenge story, HO HUM. This film is just yet another variation on the Pulp Fiction influence.
1	nuF eivom: I've read that some people find the way the intro stuff is presented -- i.e. the way you get the movie to play in your player -- to be confusing, irritating, bothersome, etc. I don't get it. It's easy, just click on "Work" and it goes, there are other things you can do leading to other screens and more, which I think makes it a far more interesting "play me screen" than the standard stuff. The packaging has all kinds of tib-bits, as if it were designed by the same people who did the Beck's "The Information" CD. The movie is done well, and adds a twist to both the "backward-drawkcab" and amnesia themes, and it's an interesting murder mystery with a great twist at the end. More of a psychological movie with a little action now and then. It's not exactly breaking new ground, so I give it four out of five stars. But it is, as my title indicates, a Fun movie.
1	Engrossing and Thought Provoking To Say The Least: Wow, what a movie...I've had a few in the past that made me go directly to the internet to see what other people thought about the ending and specific plot elements. This movie, right from the start, sucks you in and does not let you go until the ending credits roll by. I was mad at first, some movies you really want to understand and this one lets a lot of the ending come from each person that watches it. You can formulate your own stance on the ending from the various events presented in the plot. A must see, and a great DVD!
0	Thanks robe4, for the spoilers...: This movie wasn't very good, and not nearly as good as I thought it would be. Read the above guy's review and you wan't have to waste your money on this pseudo-intellectual pig. If you want something to wrap your mind around, get Waking Life by Richard Linklater.
1	wow: what a movie if u dont loke this great movie theres somthing wrong with u its just pure genius loved this movie its on my top three next to the lord od the rings trilogy
1	A great movie.: This movie is excellent. It combines an interesting idea that is enhanced by the cinematographic execution of the narrative. It is a murder mystery with a twist. The movie is played in reverse chronological order with the occasional flash-back (which is a flash-forward in the movie time line) that gives you the perpsective of the hero (Leonard). He suffered a brain injury during a crime and remembers everything before the crime, but after it has no long term memory. He can only recall things that happened within minute or so. This means he has to make notes to give himeself cues and clues as to his current history as he tries to discover who murdered his wife.This is a movie you are going to want watch more than once.
1	Unforgettable.: Great exercise for those who like to think about the films they watch. Thanks to director Christopher Nolan whose original screenplay makes the audience feels just like Pearce's character, who knows what is going to happen, but not what happened in the moment before.
1	You'll watch it over and over: Heck, you'll have to. This movie makes you twist your mind and think around corners. After the first viewing I was wondering if the 'mystery' was ever solved! I see this as one of those great 'little' movies that are simply wonderful, like "Slingblade."
1	SMART MOVIE!!!: Brilliantly made movie. Guy Pearce is outstanding. I've never seen a movie made the way this one was. It was a little hard to follow. You have to pay attention through the whole movie. If you miss one part, you may as well start from the beginning. It is well worth the staight attention you have to pay. This is one of those movies where every time you watch it, you discover something you didn't see before. This movie has such a great story to it. I absolutely love the way it was filmed and put together. Kind of a suspensful, who-done-it, sort of movie. Rent it when you have time to get the most out of it and no distractions.
0	Navigational Nightmare Extremely Frustrating: The film is great, don't get me wrong. It is a five-star film. Just do NOT buy this special edition without being warned. The "special" part of this is that the director made it almost impossible to actually watch the movie. All of the great extra features on the disc 2 are not available unless you figure out some sort of puzzle and answer random questions the way that the director thinks they should be answered.There are cheat sheets for navigating the menus available on the web, but you really shouldn't have to do a Google search in order to watch something that you paid for!
1	One of the most original and satisfying movies ever made: Just effing brilliant. The type of movie you can watch over and over again, not necessarily to learn new things, but the very concept leads to thought-provoking inner dialogues about the nature of the self, the soul, time, and memory. The acting is fantastic, cryptic, as we aren't sure how much Leonard really knows about himself (and he doesn't know how much he knows either!) What role does his subconscious play in his actions? Has he recorded all that has happened to him, somewhere in his emotions? Do we even have a subconsious? What will his future hold? How can he live? A masterpiece that should have won some Oscars.
0	The hours....: What an awful, awful movie! Flitting through 3 lives, we discover 3 miserable people. No reason for this movie but to waste an hour and a half. The potential of these actors together would have been awesome but they were wasted on a trash movie.
0	Nicole Kidman? Who?: Meryl Streep and Julianne Moore were equally as good if not better than Nicole Kidman in this movie. I really have to wonder why the academy gave the oscar only to Kidman.And... as I watched the extra interviews with the actresses, I found myself thinking, "Who is that Nicole Kidman?" She looks nothing like the Kidman I know today, December 22nd, 2004. What did she do to her face? Botox? Today there is no expression in her face and her eyebrows are flat. THAT Kidman, in those interviews is the princess we all fell in love with in film. The faded blonde hair of late, the flat eyebrows and expressionless brow take the uncommon beauty out of her.I gave this movie two stars for Mel Harris, Meryl Streep, Julianne Moore, and Kidman. It was a mesmerizing film, but it was ultimately too in love with itself.
0	The Hours: I do not have much to say about movie "The Hours". All I will say is that I wasted an hour of my life on watching it in theaters. This movie is short, dull, boring, and its about deeply trouble lesbians. The critics out there must be crazy! They are hailing this movie as best picture of the year! Give me a break! It shocks me to hear that this dull movie has actually been nominated for nine Academy Awards! This movie is terrible. I do NOT recommend you watch it.
0	serious technical flaws: audio and visual faults made this otherwise interesting story impossible to enjoy. I have had the same problems with other videos and don't know if the problem lies with my computer or, if the issue is with the download function.
0	pretentious drivel, but oh so significant!: pretentious and obvious and oh-so-significant; in other words, is this not the PERFECT movie for meryl streep? a big disappointment from stephen daldry, after the wonderful debut as film director in "billy elliott". nicole kidman won one of the most undeserved oscars since luise rainer, nd i usually like her. and oh god, theres that "important" philip glass score ...
0	Only because there is no0-star ranking: This movie is absolutely dreadful. I am sure that there are a lot of people out there who love this movie (I know some of them), but if you are looking for a plot or decent acting, skip it and buy something else. With such a great cast, this movie should provide more...Streep looks incredibly bored throughout the movie and I just can't get past that horrible nose on Kidman. Just awful.
0	High expectations unmatched by reality: After all of Meryl Streep's successes we had just about concluded that If Meryl Streep was in the movie, it would be a winner especially when you add in the rest of the remarkable cast. Unfortunately the movie turned out to be a maelstrom of depression feeding on depression. We could not even finish the film. Others may see some redeeming qualities that we missed.
1	Streep Deserved the Oscar: While it took me more than one viewing of this film to understand its focus, I believe that Streep's performance was far better than that of Kidman's who won, by a nose (pun intended)! Kidman's part seemed to consist of a lot of hard to understand mumbling.
1	A JOURNEY THROUGH PARIS: Polemic Polanski made a decent kind of thriller, with good action and good plot twists. Great climax, also.
0	Good movie, bad DVD: I would love to buy this movie on DVD, but only after good features have been added. First of all, widescreen. No DVD should be released without the original aspect ratio. Second, this Paris-based movie should have full French language support. I checked other regions for this DVD and it *is* available in widescreen with French, but not here in Region1 (where both English and French are official languages -- both languages should be supported in both audio and subtitles on all Region1 DVDs). Other DVD features, such as audio commentaries, featurettes, and other forms of information, would be much appreciated.
0	Could be better: Should have been written as acceptable or even worse. Plastic covering had cuts in it and the paper cover was cut and very scuffed.
1	Timeless book: A light but inspiring read. Insightful and encouraging. This is 'hope' in a book for women with a style crisis.
0	Very poor piece of work: I bought this CD to listen to the sound or rain and thunderstorms. You can hardly hear the rain and thunderstorms for the much louder and very poor overlay of very poor music.
0	I only give it1 star because that's the lowest you can go!: This is NOT what I expected at all. I simply wanted a cd with the sounds of a rain storm...that's it. I didn't expect to get some cheesy music played very poorly. You can barely hear the rain over the music. The CD states that it's "Rain Storms: Sounds of Nature." Any person should be able to safely assume this does not include music. I guess I assumed wrong. Don't buy this.
1	A Good Soundtrack For a Movie I've Never Seen!: There's an interesting story behind my decision to get this soundtrack. A few years back, I saw a David Cooperfield special and he did an illusion that had a song that was unmistakably done by U2 because I recognized Bono's voice. Of course I didn't know the song title, and it doesn't appear on any of their albums. So I looked through Amazon and came across this album. After listening to a sample, that was all I needed to place my order.Now the question is was it worth it? The answer is yes! "In The Name of The Father" and "Billy Bola" are two cool songs by Bono, The two classics "Voodoo Child" and "Dedicated Follower of Fasion" are great, plus the instrumential pieces are very good. "You Made Me The Thief of Your Heart" sounds like something from one of those "Pure Moods" albums and rounds off the album perfectly.Of course one of these days I'll have to check out the movie.
1	All time favorite: I bought this soundtrack 8 years ago and is still one of favorite ever. I have always been a big U2 and Bono fan, but this CD introduced me to the music of Trevor Jones. This and the Last of the Mohicans soundtrack CD contains some of the best musical pieces I have ever heard. The favorite being "Walking in Circle".
1	The Rainbow and the Rose; Revisited: I read The Rainbow and The Rose , along with most of Nevil Shute's novels, many years ago. Interestingly, I've never read On The Beach. I have, however, recently begun buying copies of Shute's novels for rereading. I wish to see if my sixty year old personna interprets them differently than I did as an eighteen year old.At the time I first read The Rainbow and The Rose, I thought it as good as A Town Like Alice. I could not wait for Ron Clarke to become airborne once again, as he made his way across Australia, so that he would continue to experience the visions that were some sort of gift to help him sort out his feelings toward the woman he once loved and the man who'd won her heart so many years ago.I thought back then, and I think today that the book would make a wonderful movie, if done correctly and with the right people.I urge anyone with even a passing interest in Shute's work to read The Rainbow and The Rose.
1	Great for my 3 year old: Great movie- my 3 year old loves this series and it was in good rewind condition. Good price & delivery time = thanks !!!
1	Good And Very Entertaining: My 5 year old granddaughter really enjoys watching this whole series. She wants to watch them over and over. They all seem to have great lessons and messages for kids to learn. This one was good and very entertaining.
0	The Time of Great Confusion: I couldn't understand if they were speaking language or else not. Sometimes I lay awake at night and wonder if this is how those graceful creatures spoke to each other. Although this movie was a bit too artsy for me, I still thought it was pretty good even though I couldn't understand what they were saying. Overall, this is my third favorite Land Before Time movie, only the seventh and the ninth are much better. Littlefoot still rules the Jurassic Period.
0	Grandmother: Not a good movie for young children, very sassy, bullies and bad language for young children. You wonder where they get some of the things they say these days....well examples like this movie.
1	Typical Christie....Awesome...: Ok, there is little point reviewing an Agatha Christie mystery. It would be equivalent to saying that Kasparov plays a good game of chess, or that Mike Tyson hits hard. You just know that Dame Christie can spin a great yarn of intrigue, and this is no exception. Pocket Full of Rye beings with a dead body (with a pocket full of rye no less!) and suspects aplenty. As it turns out, almost everyone in the house had a reason for offing poor Mr. Fortescue. Then more murders occur, which by definition one would think would make the mystery easier to solve as there are less suspects. However, Ms. Christie is too clever for that, and much as in And Then There Were None, the reader is baffled until the very end.My only [small] complaint is that Miss Marple is a relatively small part of the novel, and it would have been nice to see a tad more of her.Relic113
1	A Complete Guide To Float Hunting Alaska: I was fortunate enough to meet Larry at a book signing recently. He gave a slide presentation which included many photos of his hunting experiences. The photos and advice shared that evening were enough to motivate me to buy and read his book. Once complete, I was chomping at the bit to get on an Alaskan river. The book's resources are endless, as are the maps and details of where to go and how to get there. His knowledge of Alaska's rivers and animals certainly makes him "the" hunter to write this kind of book. Wow!
1	The dogs love them... yes they smell but so do dogs...: My dogs love these things... have ordered several times... people say they stink... of coure they do... who cares... I Just ordered more...
1	Good Start - Predictable Finish: This film had some very intriquing elements to it. Kate Winslet was solid and Kevin Spacey was excellent. The direction by Alan Parker gave it the eerie elements that keep you uneasy throughout. However, as the story unfolds it becomes somewhat predictable where it is heading. This cheapens the ending but the film is still worth seeing.
1	Political: Kevin Spacey and Kate Winslet star in "The Life of David Gale" as a death row inmate and a news reporter. They carry their emotions gracefully giving this movie the emotion it needs. The writers found a unique style to darken death row more than the average movie. The debates about politics are eye opening to many. The editors add handwritten words and images to desplict the intensity of the next scene. The many surprises will keep the audience watching every scene closely wondering what will happen next. Those who look away for a second will not understand the rest of the movie unless they rewind it. The end has the biggest surprise(shhhhh). Afterward, one will not be disappointed, rather enlightened.
1	Excellent,thought provoking,thriller!: Although,the critics did not like this movie,that just proves that not all xritics should speak for the movie going public!I really loved this film.Great personal political film without making it seem so boringly political.Kevin Spacey is wonderful as a brillent UT professor who is an advocate for saving death penelty inmates from well...death.His partner in crime is a wonderful Laura Linney who is more passionate in her goal to abolish the death penelty.Kevin Spacey finds himself accused of Rape and Murder and with 3 days left to live.Kate Winslet is the reporter that gets sucked into his story.Kate Winslet is by far the best asset to the film.It is wonderful to see her just use her amazing talent in jeans and without a corset or taking her clothes off!HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
1	good movie: I Think this was a very good movie. I only give it 4 stars because of some of the scenes..they were meant for teenagers..sex scense and a naked chick i know it was suppose to look like a rape but they could have made the movie with her clothes on ew! But there was good acting..good plot..and a very suprising ending! GOOD JOB
1	encouraging poster for REAL women: this poster with marilyn monroe on a bench press is quite sweet, everyone at our gym soo loves it that i bought it as a gift for a friend who got a new house. should make a nice addition to his gym. i here tell she was a size14 or12 ... not a 2;)
0	Nothing more than I know before: Absolutely basic information about boat interior.Good for beginers.Information about table chart and equipments are very old. We have XXI st century
1	Great shovel for the trunk of your car...: If you park in the street or want to have all the winter gear in your trunk, this is a good choice. It takes little trunk space, but can move quite a bit of snow.
0	Bizarro Humming/Singing Ruined It For Me: I like a lot of Keith Jarrett's music and the music on this CD is great -- UNTIL you hear Mr. Jarrett start bleating out off-key humming/singing, which ruined the CD for me and made me dump it off my ipod. Sometimes it's not too audible, but once I noticed it I couldn't focus on the music anymore. Too bad -- be forewarned. Wish I had taken the reviewers' comments more seriously (instead I went by the glowing 5-star review from the All Music Guide to Jazz).
1	Deleted Scenes make it worth it: This movie has been one of my favorites for several years. Being able to view the deleted scenes was a great way to see more of what Rob Reiner was trying to create with this picture.The 'making of' special that is also included on the DVD was excellent as well. Provided plenty of comments from Rob and Nora giving an excellent view into the creative minds behind this wonderful picture. I already own this on VHS but had to add the DVD to my collection. I am glad I did.
1	Not just another "chick flick": This is the standard to which all modern "romantic-comedies" should be held. This is a truly funny and romantic movie, without being too sentimental or sappy. Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan have wonderful chemistry, the writing and acting is sharp, and most of all--this movie is laugh-out-loud FUNNY. Too often, movies of this genre are way to weepy and cute to interest most men (and a lot of women). This movie keeps the tone light and realistic, and the humor is sarcastic and clever, so that everyone should enjoy this wonderful story. And yes, the diner scene is a classic...I laugh at the woman's line at the end of the scene every time.
0	Yawwwwwn: I am probably not the person to review this movie. I think Billy Crystal has about as much acting talent as a ball of lint. No human male actually acts like that, but, hey, it's only a movie. A "chick" movie! I did not laugh once. This was supposed to be a comedic love story, wasn't it? Well, it wasn't. If you are female, you will love this flick. If not, find an excuse, any excuse, not to see this movie.
0	a contrived cliche: yuck. i really hate this film. first of all, it's as if ANNIE HALL was remade as a television sitcom. ANNIE HALL is a much better movie! It's a classic. This one is hopelessly mediocre and it dates really badly. The second reason I hate this film is how it engages in all this "Men are from Mars, Women are from Uranus" nonsense. The gender roles are so boring - the man who is dark and cynical (his name is BURNS - how profound! and obvious too!) and the woman who is bright and cheery (and whoa what a surprise - her name is Albright!) Relationships are complicated. They don't work this way. This is hollywood fantasy at its worst. It's dangerous because it dupes people into believing that their lives will end up like the ones they see on screen when the sad fact of the matter is - most marriages end in divorce and there is no such thing as happily ever after.do i sound cynical? i'm really not. and before anyone accuses me of anything, i've been happily married for ten years. so there.
0	You'll need a shower after this one...: If you're the kind of movie-goer who enjoys original content and intelligent suspense...then look elsewhere, kids, cause Sleepwalkers really sucks. Usually I'm more eloquent than that, but...wow...this was bad. I especially love it when Charles offers Tanya a ride home, she declines, and then he is seen WALKING HOME. Where's his car?? Anyway, just don't see it, folks. I really want to be more specific, but words escape me. Cats jumping on people. A guy getting stabbed by corn. Cheesey lines up the proverbial "wazoo". Just don't see it. Wait, I take that back! See it for writer Stephen King's cameo as the guy who owns the graveyard. He's actually pretty good. Even with guest appearances by Mark Hamill and Ron Perlman, King gives the best performance of the film. But, other than that...wow...BAD.
0	Hard Read: This book is not an easy read; to many diversions within the story to get excited about the character. It hurt my "head" to try and stay with it. I enjoy reading, but this book takes the joy out of reading! It has taken me months to get to the 6th chapter
1	Very Stylish Sneakers: I gave my 3.5 year old daughter, whose favorite color is pink, a pair of these for Christmas. They are adorable and, as my daughter puts it, "extra fancy." So far they seem comfortable, too.
1	good movie: Bought this as a gift, receipient requested it and said she enjoyed it, so that's good enough for me. Happy New Year.
1	satisfying and fun: great movie with Depp as Sam who falls for Joon played by Masterson who is mentally ill and who has an older brother played by Aidan Quinn. wonderfully acted with Depp doing great bits. for his loving women fans. a not to be missed Depp film I might add.
1	An odd wonderful dramatic romantic comedy.: An Normal but Mentally Ill Artist named Joon (Mary Stuart Masterson) falls in love with a Odd Quirky Outsider named Sam (Johnny Deep), who has the Talent and does Tribute to his favorite Comedian Star:Buster Keaton. But her Over-Protective Brother named Benny (Aidan Quinn), who doesn`t want her to be seen with Sam but the love between Sam and Joon is Stronger than anyone think.Directed by Jeremiah S. Chechik (The Avengers) has made a Bittersweet Romantic Comedy. This film has a great supporting cast-Including:Julianne Moore, Oliver Platt, C.H.H. Pounder, Dan Hedaya, Joe Grifasi and William H. Macy. This is a Rare Film, which has become a classic genuine film. Grade:A-.
1	Benny and Joon DVD: This is a wonderful movie. It arrived within a few days in perfect condition and was packaged with care to the contents. We are very pleased and would recommend this seller.
1	Benny and Joon: I'd forgotten what a great movie this is! Johnny Depp, Mary Stuart Masterson, and Aidan Quinn are fabulous. This most untraditional romance will really touch your heart.
1	I love this movie: Johnny Depp is amazing in this movie. It always makes me laugh and cry no matter how many times i have seen it. The sister ya she is a lil off but Sam fell for her and her brother Benny is skeptical and overly protective of his sister. Its a great story and makes a great addition to any house hold collection.
1	Great CD!!!: I bought this CD the day I went to go see the movie. The whole CD is wonderful, but the Faith Hill song is the only letdown on this CD. I recommend getting this CD, but when you do, don't listen to the first song.
0	hans falls short on this one!!: after last year's majestic score for gladiator, i had high expectations for the pearl harbor soundtrack. much to my dismay, the music no more than "sorta pretty". it evokes no feelings like gladiator's worldly mood. plus, with all due respect to mr. zimmer, the defining chord sounds awfully familiar to a Enya song some years ago (i think it was enya). i don't need the faith hill song...... plus, unlike the gladiator score which the listener could visualize the story, the same isn't true with this release of the soundtrack. PLEASE GIVE US MORE MUSIC WITH A SECOND RELEASE!!
0	Viva Plant protector net: Even though I ordered the largest size of netting protector, it did not cover even1/2 the diameter. I have a potted tree in a very large pot that I did not want my young sons (1yr & 2yr) getting into. So I ordered this product thinking this will solve my problem, but it did not fit and tore rendering the product completely useless and big waste of money! The sizes need to be specific to the diameters of the pots so that you can measure. I am now back to my original home made cover which is a giant plastic plant water catcher that I cut in half with some heavy weights on top to keep the plastic on. Looks bad when not covered by a tree skirt, but it works!
1	Working Windows Works: ... It arrived on Friday, and was an easy read, with lots of diagrams and helpful hints. On Sunday I attacked a 73 year old double hung window which had been painted shut for decades, and everything I encountered was just as described in the book. By the end of the day, the window had been reassembled and both sashes now function properly. My total out of pocket cost was less than $20, including enough materials to do several other windows. To make this review a "5" the author should include a reference list of where to find those "hard to find" parts (including internet URL's).
0	Thoughtless, effortless, just bad: Maybe I could take a great song by a great band, such as Girlfriend - July For Kings, and sing my own version. Ordinarily that wouldn't really get anyone anywhere, but if you are on TV and plug your CD, then I guess it might. Reasons not to buy this CD....1) His first single isn't his. 2) He was the bachelor, not the American Idol. 3) July For Kings has a much better cd for a lower price due to the lack of Hype. 4) Clay Aiken puts this guy to shame. 5) His pretty-boy face, not that pretty. 6) The CD consists of thoughtless effortless jargon babbled with the intention of making money. 7) This album is awful. 8) Those who recommend this CD say things such as "what a hottie" "he sang so well on the bachelor" "he wrote all his own mateial" all of which doesn't make any sense. 9) He is awful10) You could spend the money on stuff that isnt so.....awful, such as underwear that is three sizes too small, or maybe ear muffs.
0	Horrible Attempt at Music: If you're a delusional fan of 'Bachelor Bob', it rocks!!!!For anyone else, it's easy to see why Bob Guiney never made a career in music. His sound is described as being similar to John Mayer, yet Mayer has considerable talent. I would call him more of a poor man's combo of Toad the Wet Sproket and the Gin Blossoms. No tracks stand out, although I'm sure 'Girlfriend' will get some airplay when the album gets a full release. It has a feel of an album written10 years ago, with a sound that's been heard and passed by.If you like John Mayer, buy his album. He has talent.Save time and buy it used in a $1 bin.
0	fake: if i were all of u wanting to buy this cd, i wouldnt. cause he dosent sing this song. a band call july for kings do and how do i know this cuase my the band started in my hometown. and i would also know cause my cousin used to drum in the band when they made the cd. so go out and get july for kings cd swim cause its the real song girlfriend its tons better
1	Will make you laugh out loud: Reminded me a lot of some of Lewis Grizzard's work. Great travel book that you can pick back up anytime.
1	A Classic !: I never thought about reading this book until I heard the Jimmy Buffett song "That's What Living is to Me". The intro of the song starts with the comment in the preface of the book by Mr. Twain,"Be Good and You Will Be Lonely". I realized then that there must be some great substance in this book, since Jimmy had probably based several of his songs on the book. Being a good Parrothead, I read the book and now understand the substance. Twain's account of his steamboat voyage around the world is a classic. He mixes his subtle humor, clever storytelling, and sarcasm with his observations of life on this fascinating journey. If you don't have a sense of humor, this will give you one. Sometimes it will make you just grin, other times, you will laugh out loud.
1	Kentucky's Domain of Power,Greed and Corruption: I believe Jim Murray is doing a tongue in cheek- he actually gives the book a high rating so I think his comments are teasers to get the readers in Ky to think and read the book no matter if it lowers the opinions of the Big Blue Zealots etc Honesty is never out of style-Truth can always bear being examined-Ky has had glorious times in sports but it has also had its dark ages and pages-the fans cannot just claim the good and disclaim the bad- it is all of one cloth- Ellison merely tells it like it was found in her research and definitely allows the reader to see when she has her own interpretation and leaves the reader to make their own judgements -honoring their own intellect integrity and dignity
0	Can Not Read: Please tell me how I can, either speak to a customer service rep. or send a notice to someone. I received a book, with the proper title "Kentucky's Domaine of Power, Greed and Corruption", however upon opening it, I found that the contents were "The Sighted Singer", a book on poetry. I have no idea on what I should do. I tried to get into my account, but have forgotten my password. I followed the procedure 3-4 times, and can't get an e-mail, from you giving me the password. Please e-mail me, as what I should do.... If I don't hear from ypu soon, I know nothing to but file a dispute with American Express, which will stop the payment. I would like to have the book, but I can find no way to speak yo anyone, except through this review. I hope you can help me.
0	Defective oxy acetylene torch: This was a great deal if it had worked. The gas regulator had leak by when set to zero. Amazon was not good about sending a new one they said the price had gone up and I would have to pay the new increased price. I just got a RMA and returned it. Could not get the seller on the phone. Tired of messing with it went to welding supplier and bought new. Some things just should be bought locally.
1	Fantastic: This foot bath is amazing. The jets are powerful and the water actually will heat up to (I forget the exact temperature)120. I felt the water start to cool down little bit but then the heat kicked in and it was glorious. I just got it yesterday, so I'm hoping the life of it lasts or else I will need to re-review. So far so good. I'm not listening the directions though...I AM using foot salts. That's basically the whole reason I bought a foot bath. The rollers do nothing for my gigantic feet because there's no room to roll around, but the water is super deep and there's even a fill line for those of us (like me) that don't know how high it can be filled. I think I'm in love.
1	Great Foot Bath: I purchased it as a gift, and I've been thanked a few times already! Works very well and is a big size to handle size13's! If there would be a down side, it would be that it is heavy to lift to empty. The positives way out-weigh this one item.
0	comfortable but with problems!: I feel comfort to try this machine.But three problems.first, it makes too much noisy.second, the machine is too big.third, according to the instruction, two rolling nodes and a pumice stone should be found in the box with the foot spa machine. But I did not find them.
1	Brookstore foot spa: Received the foot spa and we were able to immediately start using it. The remote control is great so you can keep relaxing and not bend over to change things. The jets are nice and strong. The best part is the heated water temp. It never cools off, in fact you might have to turn the heat off and maybe back on if you stay in it long. I love this feature. Very happy with this purchase.
1	Excellent Choice: Very good product, we used it two days now and my mother loves it. The only negative is it heats slow. It would be nice to have a sensor that advises when the water is warm instead of waiting with feet in water. Other than this, it is very well liked by her.
1	Good But With A Caution: Although this one is fairly better than part 6,7,8 and10, it's more like Jason channels his brain and "heart" through different bodies. The concept is okay but Jason only appears for like15 minutes tops. What really boggles the mind is how did he come back to life after he was in waste in N.Y. Still, this should have been the ending leading up to his confrontation with Freddy but then came Jason X....nuff said.
0	What Were They Thinking?: When I was younger, I was a huge fan of all the great horror series: Halloween, Nightmare On Elm Street, and, of course, Friday the13th. I can watch them now and laugh, especially at this garbage to which the filmakers obviously had no idea what they were doing. This used to be a great series, but the last 4 or 5 have been a major disappointment. Jason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday steals basically every idea from Halloween and N.O.E.S., and it doesn't stay consistant with it's previous sequels. The plot and acting are terrible, and it never quite feels like a Friday movie, but rather a cheap imitation of one. The only good thing about this movie was the very end, and even that now seems a little silly, too.
1	far fetched but a good scare: Just one more jason movie. Part 9 is a good one but also quite different. Now, when has jason ever transfered bodies ? He uses different victims' bodies to get around in this one. The actress Kari Keegan does a pretty fine job in acting as jason's distant blood relation. There are a couple of scenes in which this movie gets pretty disgusting. Especially in the freaky diner scene in which jason uses Kari Keegan's hot shot boyfriend's body to kill quite a few people. All in all, a good movie for a scare. If you are constant with the jason movies be all over this !
0	garbagex9: This movie was boring and whack again like all the friday the13th movies were, wow not even close he just blew up and a stupid black guy ate some of his remaining's and he turned into what jason was a evil phyco this movie was so whack.
0	jason went to hell with this trash: acting like none of the other movies happened jason goes to hell takes the series in a new and horrorible new turn. steeling from "the thing" jason is not unstopable he just takes over new bobies when he needs them?? huh where did that come from???? not worth the 2 for11 dollars bin at wal-mart, just junk!!!!!!!!
1	I liked it...: I thought this movie was pretty good! It has more of a developing plot than some of the others in the series (such as Jason being ressurected, then killing stupid teens at camp crystal)...well to understand the plot switches, see the movie. The violence level is pretty high, so those horror fans that get squeamish should not apply (if your watching the un-rated version, but if your seeing the R-rated version, you'll be ok). I can't wait for Friday the13th part10 (coming soon), and unfortunatly, Jason VS Freddy has been canceled (seriously, this is not a rumor, it has been canceled)...I read all about it in a famous UK horror magazine interview...
1	Spirit Filled Experience: This DVD is powerful and filled with the anointing. With Michael W. Smith as the vehicle of praise, he fills the room with worship. It becomes contagious and the audience catches on fire, and in turn although the viewer is not physically present the fire passes on to them. It is a magnificent dvd in that respect. Everyone should experience it.
0	A waste of time: Have you ever rented a movie, and about10 minutes into (sometimes less, sometimes more) realized that you had just wasted your movie? Well, thats exactly what I did with this movie. This movie I guess was trying to be a comedy, but was not funny at all. The lovestory part is nothing new and terribly borring. Just a waste of time in general to watch this. I can't see why people would rate it over 2 stars!!!!
0	Sandra and Hugh Just Were Not On Target: TWO WEEKS NOTICE was a cute film but missed the mark unlike its predecessor Maid In Manhattan which was more real and entertaining. Sandra Bullock (Miss Congeniality, Force Of Nature) produced this film as well as stars in it. Her performance although I am sure is honest seemed a little held back playing the Harvard Lawyer fighting for the down-and-under trod.While the other side of the coin, there is the rich millionaire played by Hugh Grant (Nine Months, Notting Hill) was a more outgoing, non-caring and flamboyant wisp that almost didn't match to well with Sandra.It ran a little slow and seemed much more predictable toward the end. Written and directed by Marc Lawrence (Miss Congeniality, Force Of Nature) the movie seemed very slow in pace. Robert Klein (Primary Colors, One Fine Day) gives a standout performance as Sandra's father that is worth noting.This is a good movie for the video and DVD - but theatrically it was a little disappointing. (12-31-02)
1	Hugh Grant looks good again and it is soooo funny!: I think this film was hillarious. I liked it when Sandra got stuck on Hugh's belt, When they were trying out the bed and when sandra walks in on them playing strip cheast. I though it was soooo sad when they were in the hellicopter and i was just like tell each other how you feel. But it is just like most of the other romantic films...Hugh Grant looks very nice again and Sandra was very pretty in her dress.So over all good movie, but it could have been more original.
0	Great movie - badly produced DVD disk: Love the movie, but beware of this DVD. 3 times I've ordered it from Amazon (twice in a Slipcase and once in a Keepcase, and all 3 DVD's skipped, the video broke up, scenes kept repeating, etc... And yes, I used the Memorex CD cleaner on the DVD player without any change, and no, none of my numerous other commercially purchased DVD's demonstrate this problem. Two Weeks Notice is the ONLY one. So my suggestion is to stick to the VCR version.
0	Bullock boring. Even Hugh Grant can't save this movie.: Hugh Grant does his enjoyable act to perfection in this movie but it is so lacking in story that it's rendered mind-numbing syrup even by romantic comedy standards. The schlock political message they attempt is embarrasing even to liberals.And let's face it, Sandra Bullock is just not a screen beauty, cute maybe, but that nasal voice that not will carry a movie.
1	What the critics find lacking I find fun escapism: Okay, so you knew how the story would end at the beginning, but isn't that true of all romantic comedies? If you like the genre, you accept that the storyline is predictable but that seems to be what the "artistic" movie critics abhor. I enjoyed this movie. I enjoyed Sandra's quirky antics and Hugh's self-centered blindness. But I also enjoyed "French Kiss" and "Kate and Leopold." Is this the absolute best romantic comedy out there? No. But does it provide 70-80 minutes of escapism? Yes.
1	A must see: This is such a good movie I can't believe it is not for sale! I have to agree with the other viewers that it took me back a few years but boy did it make me feel good. They should definetly release this again! My husband got tired of paying for rentals for this movie so he found it for me on an Internet auction site. Everytime I say that I want to watch it he says oh that again but I think he secretly likes it just as much as I do. After seeing this movie it is no wonder why Julia is such a big star.
0	BORING: This film was just stupid. Several friends work in a pizza parlor together, and their lives go in different directions. Julia Roberts in one of her earliest roles, and MY MY MY has she changed. She played a loose, temperamental "town ..." who gets involved with a rich guy and has to figure out how to play on his turf (preparation for Pretty Woman, maybe?), Lili Taylor plays a girl who is soon going to marry her long-time boyfriend. She has doubts, but in the end does marry him. Another character (Annabeth Gish, I think) is saving money to go to Harvard (or some Ivy league school) and finds a job as a nanny. The man who hires her is married, his wife is in England or somewhere, and they have an affair. And when the wife arrives, he tries to pretend nothing ever happened. Nothing new about that story. The film tries to show the womens' enduring friendship, but it is all... dull and contrived.
0	No Freddie, no good.: It is unimaginable to think of a Basie album without Freddie Green, not to mention several tunes with electric bass guitar. This, along with Basie with strings, are among the very very few lousy Count Basie albums. Don't bother with this one. Pablo should be ashamed for releasing it.
1	Excellent product for thirsty pets: I have used this product for several months without any major issues. I would recommend this waterer to any potential buyers. It is sturdy and easy to clean. There is a gurgling noise when the water needs to replenish in the bowl. At first, the sound startled my pets but they are all accustomed to the noise. They adapted from a bowl to the waterer rather quickly. I have three of these waterers in my home. They are shared by three cats and three dogs.
0	Poor quality bottle: Be prepared to replace the weak plastic bottle within a year. Oh, yeah, you can't buy a replacement bottle, you have to buy a whole new unit!
0	Depicted wrong: Not what I expected. Has the big hole instead of the small hole for the water to come out. With this a lot of dirt and junk gets back into the water jug.
0	FILLING/PLACMENT DIFFICULTIES....: These pet "silos" are a wonderful invention to keep the "Baby's" bowlsfilled and to keep the owner from bending over sooo frequently!!!HOWEVER-the Petmate Le Bristo, besides being a bit "pricey"is rather difficult to fill-or- rather difficult to place on the floor once filled.Since the product "bottle" dosent actually lock securely to the base, once you have filled it with food (or worse) with water, you flip it right side up.Then, you bend to place it on the floor & POW!!-it slips apart and all the cereal (or water) is spilled everywhere!!!The actual owners of this product know what I'm describing!!So once this unit is filled & placed in "Baby's" feeding area-all is well-BUT if you spill, you will be vacuuming or mopping for an hour!!!
0	No lid like in the photo!: The photo is deceiving. This arrived without a lid, so you have to tip it over to fill, and try and fit it in the bottom without spilling the water all over. I think they are using a photo of the FEEDER, which does have a lid. This is a big difference.The feeder is great, but I will probably return the waterer, it's too hard to fill.
0	Never Again!: If I could rate this lower than one star, I would! I received a petmate le bistro feeder some months ago. I couldn't use it immediately because of a medical condition of one of my cats. A month ago I took it out of the box, programmed it and was very satisfied for about two and a half weeks. Then it stopped working. I put in new batteries (even though the ones in it should have still been good). I tried to reprogram it and it does not work. I went on the internet to find an e-mail address for Petmate Le Bistro, but there is none. I tried to call the 800 number that is listed. I was on hold for 45 minutes and then I lost patience. It is good for nothing and I will junk it. I am certainly not going to wait even another 5 minutes for that company to answer the phone. Thank you for letting me review this very expensive product that certainly does not work from a company that couldn't care less.
1	keeps fresh water for all 3of my dogs: I have 2 of these and love them .. except when the puppy plays in the bowl! .
1	works great but: the tank works great and stays cleaner than others I have had in the past but someone should have engineered some kind of handle into it. I have spilled a lot of water on the floor getting the tank back on top. Still I would recommend this dog water dish, and it can be a bit funny to watch the dogs get used to the bubbling of the water tank.
0	No home should be without a Regis Philbin.: This album was originally released in1968, when Regis was Joey Bishop's sidekick. It was Regis's only commercially released album, although he later recorded some albums that he released on his own. Regis had an okay singing voice, but it was certainly nothing special. Also, his style was hopelessly outdated by1968. The arrangements of these standards are incredibly corny, too. But a few of these songs are good for a laugh. The highlight of the album is the end of "Toot, Toot, Tootsie/Baby Face", where Regis yells out "Sock it to, 'em, Tootsie!". Now, that's (unintentional) comedy!
1	Hot Stuff, Ridiculous Price: The lives of the dysfunctional Fisher family, their friends and co-workers, makes for a highly entertaining black comedy.I have the first two seasons on tape, which is good, because the price for the first season DVD is beyond ridiculous for13 eps and the paltry few extras that HBO has deigned to give us.The four-star rating is solely for the quality of the series - *not* the package itself....
0	DVD release not on BluRay: This isn't as much a review as much a question. Are they releasing Season1 again next month but not on BluRay, why???
0	Meh: Based on the other reviews, I am in the minority. This series just didn't do anything for me. I never got into the characters or even felt like i couldn't wait for the next episode. I don't know what it was, it was just boring. I never watched past the first season so i don't know if it got better or what but there is just better shows out there.
1	Kingdoms Review -eels-: A man called e and Abroken toyshop are profoundly astonishing and origanal albums. Following are three more adversly fantastic epics - Beautiful Freak, electro shock blues & daisys for the galixy making up an altogether complete collection. Phase by phase of E's Life is remarkably reflected throught your musical collection of one of the most origanal and alive artists of today.
1	Cute and Quirky But No Turkey: Jad who? I hear you ask. Well, the lyricist and singer on this quirky collaboration with the Scotchy guitar poppers is an obscure offbeat American musician and visual artist whose approach to painting and music is basically one of child-like innocence. The cute cover art is therefore a good indication of what to expect inside.Sounding like a candy-store Lou Reed, Jad Fair talks-more-than-sings his screwball cartoon lyrics against TFC's excellent musical backing. Just like when we were age11, Frankenstein and Superman constantly get name checked.Once the mild irritation factor wears off, you realize that it's actually very effective, as on the rocking "Crush On You," where Jad sings: "Well, if your looking for a love song/ you've come to the right place." Or the hilarious "Always In My Heart," where he admits, "I might not be a Beatle/ but I've got needs like a Beatle/ All I need is love."
1	Switching Stories: This movie was good because it had a lot of nudity and the best parts were when they switched stories from one to another. There was one story where the director was shooting a vampire movie. The other was in his head - he had something else going on involving a murder.
0	They've got their own way.....: Of ripping fans off. And this is yet another example. (Oh and Duranies, spare me the "well don't buy it!!" rant, it's old.)Just like everyone else has said, this is just a repeat ONCE AGAIN of the old DD videos that every fan already has. Sure, the 3 versions of NMOM is cool to have, but not worth the $34.95 MSRP. And what is with that? Erasure is releasing a DVD with 35 videos and another disc of really rare surprises....and the MSRP for that is $19.99!!If this release was priced a lot lower, I can see the justification of the content.But to charge such a high price, and give us the same old retread, I cannot do anything but give this DVD a very low score.Oh, yes, I am a fan that has paid many house payments on top of car payments for this band. 21 years later and 25 concerts later, I am just getting a little fed up of the scheming.
0	Weak DVD: I'll echo some of the other reviews on here: the navigation is ridiculous, as is the "easter egg" hunt. With most DVD players ability to directly access any tracks, easter eggs aren't cool anymore. And one of my favorite videos "A View To A Kill" got the opening Bond gunbarrel and the beginning of the song chopped off (I'll assume it's due to licensing issues). FYI, it's not much better on the AVTAK movie DVD either: there, the video is unedited but it's cropped at the black bars so the floating cameras get cropped as well, plus it's worse quality than the Greatest version.For a band that single-handedly revolutionized the music video world and put MTV on the map, this is a shameful and appalling DVD. Hopefully there will be definitive DVD in the future that will include My Own Way, Careless Memories, and all the other ones that got left out, not to mention proper remastering and a better interface and package design. Hope springs eternal.
1	a must for any fan: This is a great collection of the best videos-- a must-have for any Duran Duran fan. If only they had a DVD version!
1	Truly the Greatest: While many people criticize this DVD for its "difficult" menu options and for its many Easter Eggs, this DVD is truly exceptional. It is a great collection of Duran Duran's very well-made and artistic music videos from across their career. It has basically every major video they've made from their career at that point. The videos look great, and are fun to watch.Many people criticize the menus for being too complicated. Well, they're not. On each disc, three letters are the submenus to watch the videos, while the A on each disc is the album gallery. And the Easter Eggs, while they can be slightly hard to find, are very worth it. From the different versions of songs to the interviews from early on, they are definitely worth including. For an easy guide to find them, read the Wikipedia page on the DVD.
1	I found the17 mins version of New Moon on Monday!!!: Bought my copy yesterday at a bargin price about $12.99. I tried to find the hidden alternate versions and then finally found a way. The17 minutes version of New Moon on Monday is just worth every penny spent. If you can't find them, here is the tips:Try to use the function key "display" on your DVD remote. Select the chapters (or sections) by entering "1" to "38" on disc1. You'll find all the hidden interview clips and all alternate versions of the video. Alternatively, put the DVD onto your PC's DVD-ROM, and play it on PowerDVD. While playing, use the function of "jump to", this can be done by clicking the right button of the mouse, and you can go to any of the 38 chaptors in disc1. Same approaches can be applied to disc 2.The reason why I rate this set 4 stars is that it fails to include the promo videos, such as My Own Way, Nightboat, which originally included in "the first11 videos". It's just stupid.Greetings from a Duranie in Taiwan!
1	greatest close but not quite: I really enjoyed getting to see all the old classics from the band. But it seems Capitol forgot some of their other greatest. What about Perfect Day or Lonely in Your Nightmare? Although it was a nice treat to see New Moon on Monday.
1	Science and style: Why do geese don't get obese? Easy. What's sauce to the goose, is sauce to the gander. World without end. Amen.
1	Sliding Doors: Sliding Doors [Region 2]I really enjoyed watching this movie. I bought it after borrowing it from the library. Talk about love!! Yes, I would call it a chick flick.
1	twisty!!!: coming into this movie, i really did not know too much about it. from reading the box, it seemed interesting and after actually seeing it, i was absolutely captivated!!!! the concept was fantastic - i think we have ALL put ourselves in a "what-if" type scenario - wondering what would have happened if we would have made a different choice in something that we did, etc or if in getting somewhere 5 minutes earlier or later, if things would have happened differently. i really loved this movie and i don't think it was hyped enough. i am not a big gwenyth fan(not even sure if her name is spelled correctly), but i really liked her in this!!!!!
1	If I could give10 stars, I would!!!: The first time I saw this movie, I fell in love with it! If you've ever wondered "what if", you'll enjoy this movie! I can't understand why anyone wouldn't enjoy this. It's funny, emotional, romantic, and VERY intelligent! The fact that a woman's life could change course so much after a two second distraction amazes me and really makes me think. If I had to recommend only one movie to own, it would most definitly be "Sliding Doors."
1	Gwyneth Paltrow yet again does another excellent job.: This is a touching drama starring Gwyneth Paltrow as yet another Helen, who catches a train, one time she does and one time she doesn't - so she doesn't know the same person is controlling two lives! Sounds confusing, huh? But this still is a romantic, sad, dramatic film that the whole family can't miss. John Hannah also does an excellent acting job as Helen's new love interest.
1	A very well made movie, one of my all-time favorites! :): This movie is thought-enganging and has a nice mix of comedy and drama. You can relate to both of the "lives" of Paltrow and hopefully learn a lesson from her tribulations.
0	Mediocre: An original story idea that was watered down by a lackluster script, bland acting and unlikable characters. Not even Hollywood's golden girl paired with a snappy new hairdo and a bottle of peroxide could add the necessary zest.With the exception of Helen and her female friend, all of the characters were repulsive and had no redeeming qualities. The film portrays John Hannah's character as 'Mr. Right,' even though he's deceived Helen all along by failing to mention a certain something about himself (I won't spoil the ending). Even his explanation doesn't get him off the hook, because he still lied and deceived her.Also, I could understand the use for Paltrow's accent in Shakespeare In Love and Emma, but was it really necessary in this movie?
0	Battle of the Scrawny Suitors.: A look at two scenarios for Helen's (Gwyneth Paltrow) life: what would have happened had she made the train, and what would have happened had she taken a cab. Paltrow must have been cursed, because both scenarios involve wimpy, talky, Woody Allen-wannabe suitors. The sleaziest characters, Gerry (John Lynch) and Lydia (Jeanne Tripplehorn) go about their business awkwardly, without any verve, and pretty much suck most of the life out of this movie. Paltrow even manages to look unappealing in the "made the train" scenario, sporting a 'do that makes her head resemble a rectangle.
1	A real feel good film: Fantastically clever storyline and wonderful characters. Funny and sad, I'd watch it over and over again!!
0	free list should be free: I don't really like it when they put ebooks that cost money on the list that states free! I don't care how good the book is or isn't, free list should be free. It is very maddening when we get caught paying for a book that should not have been on the free list to start with.
1	Good performer: This item worked well for the first run. It is reconditioned item but it is well worth a try. The carpet dried quicker than I thought. The water took buckets of dirty particles out of my carpet and now it is very nice. Simply, happiness. I didn't go for less than $100 retail model because it wasn't flexible. #1, you can add a hose with this model. #2, amp is 7.2. More amp is better suction power. Anyway, I saved some money on this. I hope it lasts for a while.
0	A questionable cast spoiling a not-quite-there-yet score.: I very much enjoyed the American version of Sunset Blvd., but the original London version doesn't do much for me. It contains the original (and no longer current) versions of many of the songs, leaving the material with a "score" lacking the polish it received when it arrived in America. There are, however, subtle but tantalizing hints of what the show would eventually become. But it is the cast that is the reason to not buy this 2-disc set. Unless you want to hear Kevin Anderson trying to act and sing at the same time, Daniel Benzali sing a role in the wrong range, and Patti LuPone miscast more than just any other actress in musical theatre history, skip it and buy the far superior Glenn Close/Alan Campbell version instead.
0	Weird Movie: This movie certainly has great actors in it, and they did a good performance, but I didn't really care for the story. I would not recommend this movie too highly. I would be interested to read the story it came from.Agnes of God
0	Not Vintage MacLean: This is the weakest book of his I have read, and that is about thirty MacLean novels. I understand that he passed away prior to this book being published and that is was compiled posthumously. While admittedly not all of his books are great, I don't feel this is up to snuff with any of the others. Don't make this your first MacLean book and unless you feel the desire to read every one of his books like I choose to, take a pass on it. I am unwilling to touch any of the Alistair MacNeill books written using MacLeans notecards because I feel those are apt to be pretty weak too, and no one ever seems to duplicate the originals. If you are going to give a couple of MacLean novels a try, go for "Where Eagles Dare", "Puppet on a Chain", "Bear Island", & "Ice Station Zebra".
0	Disappointing: I read "On Beauty" based on its favorable reviews and my fondness for "White Teeth." However, I was disappointed to find "On Beauty" a shallow and immature book with underdeveloped characters. Equally bothering to me is the cultural context, which does not ring true. I have lived in the Boston area most of my life and am an academic. Smith's knowledge of Boston is slight and removed, while her perception of academia is that of a student. In addition, she has a weak grasp of American English. These problems combined to destroy this reader's "willing suspension of disbelief."
0	No more books about writers.: I am tired of books about writers. I'm more tired of books about academics and universities. I give a free pass to Nabokov and that's it. This is purported to have such a great ear for language and move so seamlessly between these different races and classes and I didn't buy a bit of it. It lost me for good at the scene at the spoken word/poetry jam. Ultimately this could turn out to actually represent reality but I certainly hope I would never know about it. Goofy. The snarky Haitian guy, what? Maybe literature is becoming so narrowly focused that it's just writers writing for writers and reviewers (being writers) getting all fired up but it's getting lost on me.
0	Disappointed: After reading White Teeth I was expecting this novel to be of the same calibre, sadly it is not. The plot is very jerky and the characters are under developed. The idea for the novel is good but it does not hang together well. White Teeth's weakness was it's ending and I think this novel has the same weakness or more so, a novel that seems to go nowhere, shame as it had so much potential.
0	Pointless and disappointing: Considering the awards it won, this should be a great book, but I found it very unengaging. The author sets up any number of interesting subplots (son of H is about to wed daughter of M, his arch enemy; K gets cheated out of inheriting a valuable painting by her deceased friend's family) but all these conflicts somehow just evaporate. Considering that the first 200 pages of the book are the setup, and the second 200 are one expectation after another thwarted on the part of the reader, this makes for very disappointing reading. Add to that that every character manages to lose our sympathy the second they gain it (K and C seem to become friends, even though every single recorded conversation contains snubs and misunderstandings) and I had the hardest figuring why I should care about any of them.
1	Wow: Once I started this book I could not put it down. There was no mercy on this family. What a page turner!
1	Strong Characters in On Beauty: Like many other posters, it took me awhile to fully grasp On Beauty. I read White Teeth right before Beauty to get a grasp of the writer. In my opinion, Smith is much more focused on character development-where as the plot can sometimes become slow or irrelevant. She takes her time to develop each character with their flaws and curious qualities. I guess that it why it took me so long to understand or even care when Howard was discussed as a character. However, take the time to keep reading and you will see how he develops along with his family and colleaguesEven though the book can be "adjective heavy" with the plot, I still found it enjoyable and related to my college experiences with all types of students. Read On Beauty for what Smith does best---become invested with the characters.
0	Huge disappointment: Many of my friends had recommended White Teeth to me, so when a book club I go to picked On Beauty by the same author, I was excited. However, I thought this book did not deserve any of the accolades heaped upon it. Her metaphors are way over used, and some of them just made no sense. Other descriptions were just so poor that I didn't know what she meant then either. Physical descriptions of characters left me picturing that everyone was one of Van Gogh's Potato Eaters, and I couldn't see why, in this book focused on love and relationships, anyone was with anyone for anything. It is said that writers should write about what they know. Based on her descriptions of anything American, I was surprised to learn that she had been in the country even once. She needed more research and a better editor. What's weird though is that I could see she was talented. But after this there is no way I want to try White Teeth. I don't trust her to not make me mad with these elements again.
0	Disapointing read: I first spotted this book when it was released in hardcover and was excited about it. I LOVED her novel White Teeth and was impressed by the glowing reviews of On Beauty. Once it came out in paperback, I scooped it up. My first impression was not a good one. The dialouge in the beginning was flat, boring and often times confusing. But I trudged on, hoping that it would be another Zadie Smith gem. It never got any better. The characters were dull, annoying and stereotypical. The plotline was never interesting. All in all, i was very disapointed. Zadie Smith is usually a brilliant writer and that is the only reason I forced myself to make it through the book, months later. A good book usually takes me about 3 days. If you haven't read White Teeth, get that instead.White Teeth: A Novel
0	Disappointing: I recently got this book and White Teeth and was disappointed in both. Descriptive passages without narrative momentum, snarky and repetitive. This author does not have much to say. I would recommend at least getting them from the library before you waste any money.
0	not even snoop could save this one: bad movie terrible visual effects low budget filming just horrible i hate i even purchased it
0	The movie is not as good as it should have been: The movie sucked. Snoop, your a bad ass but yo, I don't know what you were thinking when you did this movie.
0	Made Because of Snoop Dog's Indiscretion with an Aardvark: One insightful reviewer wrote Snoop Dogg was forced into being in this travesty because someone had a picture of him and an aardvark doing what only should be done with one's spouse. That reviewer may well be on point. Either that or Snoop Dogg was seduced with that funny plant sometimes called Mary Jane. Also, what is up with the lighting for this story? The movie appears to have been recorded on film made in1917. Bright lights obscure faces, and color is as rarely seen as is any semblance of acting. Maybe an out-dated film stock was deliberately purchased to save money. I wish everyone involved in this abysmal attempt at movie making had saved their time and effort. It would have saved me from regurgitating my dinner while being visually assaulted by it.
0	Don't bother!: This must be the most god awful movie on the PLANET! If I was alowed to give this film ZERO stars I would, but Amazon won't let me!This film is so bad, I can hardly believe this would be sold by anyone anywhere! Don't waste your time or your money! HORRID.
0	DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!: Albert Pyun,Please don't direct another movie.My 8 year old nephew could have done better with a camcorder.
0	A Disappointment: I have read almost all of Mitchner's books and I have enjoyed all of them until this one. It is bland, overly predictable. It also seems like whoever wrote it (I would be willing to bet that some ghostwriter did or maybe James Mitchner JUNIOR to collect just one last big royalty before the old guy died) Which would be very ironic since the book spends lot of time on GREEDY children. The book is just one long SOAPBOX for someone to attack1) greedy lawyers causing doctors to fear doing their jobs because of bogus lawsuits 2) greedy dentists in Florida who rip off old patients 3) poor blacks who no matter how hard they try will never get a fair chance; 4) lack of free healthcare for AIDS patients and 5) evil religious people who believe in the right to life..................... Gets old really fast.
1	Grocery bag size: This basket is big enough to fit one grocery bag or one Westie dog when her short legs get too tired. This basket makes my bike more functional. I'd recommend it to anyone.
1	sturdy basket: I wanted a sturdy basket that I could hold my bag and other items. This works perfectly. It was easier to put on then the directions made it seem. The directions where more complicated then needed.
1	Good: A hard to find item but worked well on my18 speed womens bike. Good for the price. Installed easily
0	Problem with charging - SERIOUS DESIGN FLAW: Bought this otherwise fantastic product. Could not charge it ater a few weeks of use. Then got another one and could not charge it after a few weeks of use. Then they sent another one 3 days ago and it has just stopped charging.And when I call the customer service they told me that it was the FIRST time they heard someone having a charging problem with Plantronics 590a. Somehow I am having a hard time believing them. I feel they are getting dozens of calls each day.Any other readers - if you are having a similar experience - pl post your charging woes.Sad that this is an otherwise good product. But unusuable due to this problem. I recommend prospective buyers to hold off until these design flaws or fixed. Or a competitor beats them to it.
1	Nice Item: I purchased this headset and have had it for a few days now. Overall, in stereo mode the sound quality is very nice, and the range is wonderful. I can almost walk everywhere in my house and get audio on the adapter that came with the system. If your looking for a wireless headset to use for voice communications, such as Ventilo or Teamspeak, I wouldn't necessarily suggest this one. The built in voice functionality is sub-par for VoIP communications, but excellent for phone communications. It's still an excellent headset, and wireless is a god sent, but I am still using a wired mic for best quality of sound. If you have extensive knowledge of bluetooth, I believe there is a way you can rewrite the stacks to get CD quality sound in voice communications mode. However, I use a Logitech DiNovo bluetooth desktop and it causes extensive lag in communications mode when hooked upto my existing bluetooth adapter.
1	battery life: these head phones are great for truck drivers, the battery life is on ly about 8 hours other than that there perfect
1	Exactly what it supposed to do.: I've had my headset for almost a year now.I got it for the same price as you can get it today.....here(less than $120).I use them mainly for skateboarding, so they get put through the ringer. A fall from12 stairs is not a good example of "careful handling", neither is the rather large quantities of sweat that they have to endure.I use them with my A2DP smartphone.I have used them with the adapter and my ipod, and I have used them wired on airplanes.The sound quality is good.The range is good.I don't have any cracks in the plastic.I don't have any charging issues, nor do I have battery life issues.My only complaints about this product are some design features.I don't like the left-right volume controls, they should be up and down.I also don't like the very large and conspicuous blue flashing light on the side. I look like a fricken moron. These headphones are supposed to make me look cool like James Bond.Minor complaints for a near perfect product.
1	Spactacular Performances! A 'Must See' film!: Sexy! Dangerous! Thrilling! This film has it all. You too will recommend this film to everyone you know.
1	great show....filmed well and lindsey is a true artist!: Even though he was once one of the great "pop stars" in the world...Lindsey Buckingham is an artist. He creates songs from his heart...he plays guitar in a unique and beautiful way and really truly is like no other. Spending an hour and a half with him in concert is inspiring and fun...and speaking of fun, Lindsey can be so personal and heavy in his art its great when he just plays dumb/fun rock and "Holiday Road" which was his theme for National Lampoons "Vacation" gets a real workout at this show!
0	Again, not what you are looking for: Like several other discs available, allegedly of the Drifters Greatest Hits, these are not originals.Save your money. Keep looking for the originals. (I found them in "The Drifters' Golden Hits").
0	NOT 3D CARBON FIBER: OPENED THE BOX AND IT WAS NOT CARBON FIBER!!! IT WAS CLEAR!!! AMAZON NEEDS TO CHECK THEIR INVENTORY ON THIS!update***19-NOV-2010Amazon's replacement was still the same. it's not 3d carbon fiber. will return for a refund!!!
1	The best directory for the professional and amateur: This book is definately a must for anyone studying or wants to know more about essential oils. I used this book as a bible during my Diploma of Aromatherapy course, and I still find it a valuable tool for this modality, as it covers everything from where the plant originates from, its chemical properities, effects on the mind, body, skin, blending. I highly recommend this book for any aromatherapy enthusiast. A must on the bookshelf.
1	Simplistic: Dieting for Dummies is a simplistic look at diets. Just skimming through the book you can get an idea of how to get on a diet, by cutting calories and all. The book is set up in an easy to read fashion (like other Dummy books) A good overview of dieting.
0	MOTOROLA Bluetooth Headset H500: I purchased this headset Friday12/2/2005 from the Alltell office. I used it for the first time on Monday12/12/2005.Pros: Excellent headset speaker. Best I've ever heard.All features work great!!Cons: Extream back ground noise. Very poor sound quality to the person on the other end. If you drive a Tractor-Trailer truck as I do, forget this headset.DO NOT BUY THIS HEADSET!!!
1	Good but Not Really Funny: With everyone else raving about how funny this book was I bought it. I was not disappointed with the story, but it really wasn't all that humorous. Dave Barry has a much better feel for humor, especially in Florida. Still, I will read other Hiassen books. I will simply change my expectations to drama rather than humor. That's why I gave it a 4 instead of a 5; false advertising.
1	More fun than a roller coaster!: [...] I appreciate Carl Hiaasen's brand of humor. Like all of his books, Stormy Weather is satire at its best. It is dark at points, outrageous at others, and over-the-top. It is pure fun; more fun than my first roller coaster ride!Mr. Hiaasen has an active imagination which allows him to create delightfully memorable characters. He is consistent in this regard in all of his books. I haven't read one that has disappointed me yet and I have read at least six of them. There's no need for me to get into the plot. The story tells itself in an engaging way.In this troubled world we live in, it is nice to have an escape. This book did it for me. I trust it will do the same for you.Davis Aujourd'hui, author of "The Misadventures of Sister Mary Olga Fortitude"
1	A poke in the eye: I always enjoy Hiaasen. His use of irony and knife edged dialogue are a poke in the eye of those abusing our environment.
1	A great romp: A breezy read. Similar in tone to Elmore Leonard (one of my favorite "beach read" authors). Trippy, unpredictable plot, except that you know the bad guys are going to get it in the end. The question is: How?
1	Still as cheesy and fun as ever: I loved this show when I was a little girl, and rediscovering the series on Netflix and later episodes on DVD has been a hoot. What surprises me is how much my alliances have changed over the past 40 years. Now I'm totally rooting for the forces against Barnabas. He's such a jerk! What did I ever see in him? The story of my life. :)
0	NOT ANOTHER DISAPPOINTMENT!!??: just checked out darkshadowsdvd.com, to find this set is August and September1967 ONLY!!! set 2, was June and July1967, ONLY!....WHAT A JIP!!! And these sets are going to be released Quarterly, with only (2) months of shows!!!....Why not just release ALL episodes AT ONCE!!! UGHHHHHHHHHH!!! I'm thinking about CANCELLING my pre-order of collection 3. Dan Curtis is a JIP-Master!!!
1	Let It Be Fantastic: Let It Be was a great album to be The Beatles' last. The songs somewhat show that it is the end. My favorite song is "The Long And Winding Road". The music touches your heart and sends you a message. This is one of their best works. I, like most people, wish that The Beatles never broke up. Their music is fantastic and this album shows it.
1	THIS IS A DAMN GOOD ALBUM: Let It Be has gotten so much stick over the last 30 years and why? Because it's not as good as Sgt. Pepper or Abbey Road? Well not much is but this gives them a run for their money. McCartney is at his peak on this album with three of his best songs, Let It Be, The Long and Winding Road and the outstanding rocker Get Back while Lennon adds the very good Across The Universe. Yes, most of the songs have been overproduced by Phil Spector but the music still shines. I'm taking off a mark because of this and also due to the fact that the album is too short but I'm telling you if your a fan of The Beatles, get this album, you won't be sorry.
0	THE SAD :( "LET IT BE": What goes up must come down.... It happened to Elvis, Michael Jackson, and the list goes on and on!even the Beatles in1969 came tumbling down! This CD proves it.. worn out mad Beatles. Please give credit to Paul and Ringo however for putting out "Let It Be" Naked ...which did save this period for The Beatles.
0	Let It Be: I never recieved this DVD.......I emailed the seller and all he wanted was my zip code,which I sent to him....I have emailed him three times but never recieved my purchuse. I am on a fixed income and wanted it to give as a gift..I am very disappointed.....Lois Eddy
1	Good....: This is a solid album. Not the best Beatles album, but it is still enjoyable. Highlights include Two of Us, I've Got a Feeling, and Let it BE.
1	Remastered audio, yes - mini-doc, no: While I think the remastered audio sounds top-notch, I was disappointed in the mini-documentary and was glad that I didn't get the stereo box for the DVD, because these docs aren't really much. With Let It Be, I was expecting to hear the bitchy stories that we all know and love. I think the harshest thing said in this doc was that Twickenham was too cold and that Apple made for a nicer atmosphere. Then there was a comment from Paul about the Spector mix, but it didn't get any further than mentioning Glyn Johns' mix wasn't up to par and that Spector was brought in. Just enjoy the album, as it is very enjoyable, but don't expect much from the mini-doc, or from any of the mini-docs, for that matter.
1	Roy Ayers Masterpeice: This is without question Roy Ayers finest album. The cuts Mystic Voyage, and The Black Five, showcase Roy as master vibist. While the wonderful Life is Just a Moment, and Take All the Time You Need, showcase the prodgious vocal talents of Chicas, the best of the many fine female vocalists Ayers has used over the years (Carla Vaughn, Dee Dee Bridgewater, Sylvia Cox etc). Ayers was at his peak at this time. His follow-up Everybody Loves the Sunshine, was just about as good.
1	Gardening made easier: This little hoe is perfect for the small garden. It's handy, effective and easy to use in tight places. I've had the full sized hula-ho since they were invented and still prefer it over other styles, but now I have added a small raised vegetable garden and have taken up the 'square foot gardening' method, which packs plants into small squares and makes garden maintenance a much simpler process. This small hand-tool sized hula-ho is perfect for weeding and turning the soil before replanting in this limited space. In fact, this and a trowel are the only tools I need for maintenance throughout the season. This is a great little tool.Square Foot Gardening: A New Way to Garden in Less Space with Less Work
0	DO NOT BUY!: This movie is absolutely terrible! I had to ask myself if this is the downfall of Morgan Freeman. I don't know why a respected actor, such as Morgan Freeman, would take on such a script. This want to be "aliens" movie leaves much distaste with it's gorry scences and lack of script. Save your time and money!This movie starts out with a lot of potential. After the first alien comes out of the persons butt, with LOTS of blood, I was ready to turn my head and read a book, which I should've done. Graphic scene after graphic scene is what this movie is about. Unless you are into blood and evil creatures, do not buy this movie!!!!
0	Rotten Movie: If you're smart, you won't even waste your time on this one. Not only is the movie cliche, it really doesn't make much sense. I never did figure out what the mute boy had to do with anything in the film. I am surprised Morgan Freeman even took part in this horrible movie.
0	Dreamcatcher (Widescreen Edition) (2003)-Sci-fi's first ugly look behind the bathroom door!: Dream Catcher (Widescreen Edition) (2003) could have been a good sci-fi experience for me but our first glimpse behind the bathroom door was just too unsightly, even for a die hard Steven King fan like me. As such, I can not rate this film at higher than 2 stars. If this visually explicit scene could have been eliminated I am sure I would have liked this film and rated it at least 3 to 4 stars.It was enough to demonstrate that the creature gestated in the digestive tract of its host by the difficulty the victim had with eating and the resulting rude noises. The audience didn't need the very explicit lesson in Digestive Diseases. That scene aside, there was much I liked about the remainder of this movie. Pardon me for my sensibilities. I am still a Steven King fan but feel he should have stopped short at the Bathroom door since crossing that ugly threshold added nothing essential to the film.
0	Dreadful. I'll never recover those 2 precious, wasted hours: This is perhaps the worst big-budget horror film I've ever seen.I'm just surprised these guys didn't realize what a horrible turkey they had on their hands and sent it straight to video. At least then they could salve their pride. This movie is crude, It's got enormous, ridiculous plot holes. It's basically unwatchable for anyone who hasn't read the book.My sense is that this is a monster movie masquerading as science fiction, but it's just not smart enough to be convincing in either genre. The script is just too thin, and disjointed, despite being amazingly long.Lawrence Kasdan is the writer for 'The Empire Strikes Back and is a legendary talent - I'm sure this project was sold on his famous name, so this is a professional tragedy of sorts. Hopefully this isn't his last work.
0	Nothing special here, move along: Many things in the movie do not connect. A lot of things in the beginning have absolutely nothing to do with the outcome at the end. If you're going to place events in a movie, then place them there for a reason!The story is done in a way that tries to make the movie special, but it turns out to be just another "Invasion of the Body Snatchers" type of movie. This is good to watch one time, but after that you won't want to watch it over and over again. Spend your money on something else.
0	Disappointing: This movie could have been so much better. It started out fairly well but just didn't hold together after the initial introduction. The movie lost me completely in the bathroom scene. You've got a monster trapped in the toilet, but that toothpick on the floor is out of your reach, and you need it so badly that you let the monster out to get it? You have to ask yourself, "What's WRONG with this person?"Morgan Freeman's performance in this movie was also a big disappointment. He's such a talented actor, but here he seems to be just going through the motions. His character just falls flat. And as noted in an earlier review, the hair and eyebrows make him look silly and cartoonish.No big surprises in the final battle sequence. You pretty much know by this point who the two sides are going to be. But that last little bit after the fight - whose idea was that? I just wanted to shout at the television, "What? NO! That CAN'T be the end!" What a let-down.
0	Very disappointing: I love horror films and tend to be extremely forgiving of even the worst schlock, but Dreamcatcher is truly a disappointment. Upon first viewing there were aspects of this film that I enjoyed, but the more I thought about it... the less any of it made sense. The plot is convoluted, the characters are wasted, and the alien fungus-monsters seem to have the psychic ability to create massive plot holes wherever they roam.Stephen King cannabalized half a dozen of his previous works to produce this self-plagiarism, and the movie adaptation is even worse. I have seen (and own) some of the worst movies ever made, and I enjoy them greatly -- but Dreamcatcher does not merit a second viewing... or a first, for that matter.
0	Tosh, but it has its moments: This movie really isn't sure what it wants to be. Part Independence Day, part X-Men, and part Alien, it even makes references in passing to another Stephen King story, Stand By Me.Essentially the film can be divided into two halves -- the enigmatic first half where four thirtysomethings make moderate use of their ESP capabilities on their way through their professional lives, one flashback to 20-years-ago, towards a mid-winter cabin destination. In the second half, we get the ridiculous Alien/Independence Day sub-plot, with Morgan Freeman being forced to swear (frequently) in order to convince us that he's not the same endearing character from Se7en and the Shawshank Redemption.In the end, the Earth is saved -- my apologies if that ruins it for anyone -- but this dog's dinner should retain your attention for about an hour. Once the aliens turn up and start visiting people's bottoms, don't feel embarrassed about reaching for the fast-forward button.
1	Have any of you reviewers' read the book?: As with most Stephen King movie adaptions, it would make the movie better if the book is read.This book was very good (Between 4-4.5 stars) in my opinion.There was a lot to the book which, from how the reviewers are complaining, was probably left out due to the time constraints of "run time."I can understand how the movie probably is hard to understand if you didn't read the book.Next time, if the movie is an adaption from a book, read the book before you write a review.Too keep the ratings for the movie fair, I am giving the movie 5 stars even though I didn't see it, just like the other reviewers are giving the movie a low rating without reading the book. My rating is high because the book was good.
0	what in the h*ll??????: Is this movie about and what I did not understand was what aliens had to do with indian dreamcatchers??? The movie starts out well but about 45 minutes into it loses its focus and plot and everything else.......My fiance and I could not even finish the movie, King should have focused more on a different plot line without aliens, and been more involved with the childhood friends and their little "odd" friend. The past scenes with them as kids was the only really entertaining thing about this movie and I wish there had been more like the story in the movie with the evil clown (cant remember the name).This movie was awful.
0	Recipe for disaster...er, Dreamcatcher: Stand By Me, Men in Black, Independence Day, Outbreak, What Dreams May Come, the segment of Creepshow with fast-reproducing alien fungus, any Toxic Avenger movie, Deliverance, Forrest Gump.Frappe' 'em all together in a blender and strain away most of the entertainment value and plot line conclusions. Add a dash of poor acting and cheesey, unconvincing dialogue. Garnish with special effects.Voila, you've created Dreamcatcher. Watch and TRY to enjoy, though it's doubtful you will.
0	It sucks and it's boring.: At first, the movie seems pretty good and shows some potential. But then it slows down...way down...and then picks up a little bit with some ass-aliens, then mashes in some kind of crazy-general alien hunter side plot and also explores what it might be like inside the memory banks of a person. The movie is just so slow and so boring that I practically fell asleep watching it. The ending, which I won't spoil, had me laughing out loud (the best part of the movie for the wrong reason). I thought, "Hey, what if that retard was..." and then it happened. A classically bad horror ending at it's worst.
0	They really DUD IT!!!: The script is worth $1, a little more than the other Stephen King novels-turned-to-movies.What does the dreamcatcher have to do with anything in the movie?
1	Well done movie about an intriguing historical theme...: This movie is a superb historical attempt to portray the Madness of King George III of England. It takes place shortly after the American Revolution, and combines a couple incidents in King George's life into a condensed time period. Although not100% historically accurate, it is superbly done. Great acting, cast and sets. Nice movie for those interested in the time period or historically themed movies.
1	It's a great WMI book for VBscripting admins: The authors do a good job of showing lots of WMI VBscript code examples, and they weave it together with good explanatory prose. Using this book, along with the WMI SDK docs and samples from Microsoft gave me enough info to do some usefull stuff with WMI.
0	Absurd movie -- must have been "rent-due" day in L.A.: Disgusting scenes of excess violence toward women and fake orgasms all around make this ridiculous farce seem like a soft-core version of every Porn King's first feature film. As a further insult, the viewer is subjected to tortuous "analysis" via a Rogerian psychiatrist. The featured "actor" looks like a janitor in a West Virginia high school; Rosanna Arquette and Alexandra Paul, who cannot be made to look ugly, nevertheless turn in performances that are spoofs of every bad acting class. These people must have desperately needed the money. If they acted for royalties, then their earnings will be about right. Zero.
1	Really loved it, discussion about feelings, excellent: I really enjoy all the mercer Mayer books and this one I used for a kindergarten activity. I made up magnetic pieces and discussed with the children about feelings. Excellent book.
1	This Books Haunts Me: I was12 years old when I read this book (I'm now 46). My understanding and impressions of the fall of Troy and all the rich cannon of literature that surround it will be forever seen through the eyes of Helios and the other living characters in this story. No other book has ever held this sway over me. Richard Powell was a genius at character development, not just in this book, but in many of his other stories as well (Don Quixote USA!). Its sad that its no longer in print, but if you are lucky enough to find a copy, you will enjoy fictional writing at the top of its form.
1	greatest: this cd was sent promptly and it is a great cd, love to listen to the songs on this cd, i have purchased all of John McCutheon's cds
1	Top line: As a custom woodworker I have a love for tools that do the job I need done. The is the greatest little saw on the market. The only draw back is trying to find someone that sells it without going on line.
0	Slippery handle, blade dulls quickly: When I got the saw, I thought: is this really the thing that everyone's been raving about? The blade looked good, but the handle is cheap plastic, and it's slippery. It's easy to lose your grip on the pull stroke, and, worse, it's possible for your fingers to slide forward onto the blade on the push stroke. Plus, the saw is starting to feel dull after fewer than10 cuts - and I mean small cuts, mostly through pine.Note: The red dot on the handle let me to expect that the blade could fold into the handle, like a pocket knife. That seemed like a handy way to protect the blade so I could keep the saw in a toolbox. But no, the blade does not fold. That's my mistake, so it's not part of the reason for my two-star rating, but I figured I'd mention it in case someone else out there had also assumed that the blade could fold.
1	It did the job.: I had a drawer that fell everytime you pulled it out - very irritating. I purchased a drawer rail at home depot, and it was a left side rail which did not work. I purchased this through Amazon to avoid the hassle of looking at the store. Now my drawer works great. No complaints.
1	Great Western: Cast is great - good to see an early Heston in a Western role. A little long, but very enjoyable.
0	My favorite scene: When the "Major" wants to rescue Jean Simmons and make war on the Hennesy's. "Leech" (Heston) says I can't back you on this Major and all the hands agree. When the Major starts to ride in alone, Leech jumps on his horse and catches up and gets as close as he can to support his boss. Then around the hills comes all the other hands. Heston's expression is priceless.

0	Not what advertised: These are complete crap. They are not the beef tendons they used to be, or that shown in the picture on amazon. What I received is some kind of dried out, pressed flat, jerky like wafers. Also the label in the picture on amazon says "100 percent natural" but the label on the package I received says "premium quality". What I received is junk that I'm afraid to even feed my dog.
1	Excellent Treat!: I got these as a treat for my beagle, Barclay. He absolutely loves them, and they keep him occupied for hours. It's a great all natural treat, I have already bought more!
0	AAHHH!!! (as in suprise and/or alarm): me and my fellow cohorts thought we'd find a new way to torture ourselves via the medium of motion picture, or "talkies" as i perfer to call them. i started it all with "head" starring the monkeys, and thought it best i end the torture 3 or so weeks later, after such masterpieces as "battlefield earth", "kazaam", and "santa with muscles", by renting "da hip hop witch"(check the reviews on that, and i think his grudge against me is still in effect). but the pain was far from over after we found this "doozy".why was this movie even made? here's all i have to say about the movie.1-Gene Siskel called it one of the worst movies of the year... and then died later that year(possibly from the movie, we can't be sure...more tests)2-maximum of1,000 words, hrmm, i could have done it in two: Diaper Gravy.
0	More of a car accident than a movie: Both can result in Post Tramadic Stress Syndrom and both make you not want to repeat the experience. The actors are bad(and trust me I have seen many "bad movies)the plot is invisable(there isn't one) and my time was wasted. I realize that this is a kid's movie for a specific audience but happened to making a movie enjoyable for adults? Or kids over 5 for that matterOverall-I know you are not thinking about wasting your time with this movie but just in case you've blown a circut and feel compleaded to rent do not bother.
0	I must protest with all that I have......: Either Johnny8Ball is at the height of his sarcastic powers or he has contributed the single worst review ever to appear on Amazon.com. Not only is the movie he selected one of the most incompetent and offensive ever made, it is perverse, dull, slapdash, and horribly unfunny. The alleged "humor" never hits (NOT ONCE!) and the performances by the "legendary cast" range from embarrassing to downright shameful. Hopefully, potential viewers will avoid the obviously jaded rambling of Mr. Eight Ball and stay far, far away from a film that would not appeal to anyone, adults or children.
1	Excellent, kids fight over this!: This bike was a huge hit for us. Purchased for our son's first birthday an he still tries to ride it at 4! All the kids want to ride it down the hills in our yard and driveway. I even backed into it with my car and we unbent one wheel and it's still fine! We won't be able to pass it on to little brother but may buy him his own...
0	Disappointing - feet hit rear wheels: My mother purchased this for my daughter for Christmas. At the time she was15 months old. She was just tall enough for the lowest setting on the seat. She quickly learned to climb on and off and go forwards and backwards and loved her bike. The steering was a little stiff and took a while for her to get the hang of it.As spring came we moved outdoors and she got better at steering. She grew so I moved the seat to the second setting. Now, at18-20 months, the bike isn't so great -- when she tries to go forward, the back of her feet hit those rear wheels - every time! I've tried every height setting on the seat and it doesn't make a difference. She always wants to ride her bike, but gives up after just a few feet - who would want their feet to get hit all the time! The rear wheels are just a few inches too close to the seat.We will be looking for a replacement. Disappointing.
0	Defective master?: I was thrilled to see this classic released on DVD, however I've received two copies and both are defective. About 28 minutes in the picture freezes. My first copy disabled my DVD player completely; it wouldn't recognize any command except Power Off. The replacement copy shows very pixilated picture/frames then picks up the action in full again at about minute 36.There's a big disclaimer before the film begins that the original 35mm film is damaged so the picture quality of the DVD is compromised. Does this mean all copies have defects? Are others experiencing this same issue?
0	Cheasy, very cheasy: I am a big fan of the classic kung fu movies. However, I found this movie to be extremely cheasy. The One-Armed Boxer, the hero, is from a prior film. This movie fails to offer enough background about the hero, so I found myself rooting for the enemy instead. Additionally, the One-Armed Boxer's missing arm is clearly noticeable tucked within his shirt. It is hard to take him and his fighting scenes serious. Where this film lacks in plot, it makes up for in a multitude of characters and creative fight scenes. You will see where many video games got inspiration for characters and fighting techniques. Instead of this film, I suggest a film with Bruce Lee, the Venom Mob, Gordon Liu, Jackie Chan or the "Five Fingers of Death".
0	GREAT MOVIE!...but...: I am writing neither to critique the movie nor to eplore the quality of the video or audio. I would simply like to warn potential buyers of the manufacturer defects that I have enconter with TWO copies of this DVD.The first copy was scratched so severly it looked like a fat guy attempted to use it to ski down slopes of rough pavement. So Amazon promptly shipped out another. The second copy didn't have a scratch but the movie hung up in the EXACT same place as the first. ANNOYING! I am currently waiting on another copy, but if it's bad I'm giving up.*IMPORTANT* Consumers, take my review very seriously because I suspect these other reviewers have no experience with the DVD, they're just fans of the film. And what an awesome film it is.
0	Does quality matter???: I bought this movie yesterday and it really is a classic! But the quality seems to go to hell throught certain scenes, flickering colors. It even stopped playing about 30 min. in. I don't know what's up but I really feel ripped off. Maybe the double disc version will be better. Highly doubtfull concidering this version was supposedly remastered?
1	Old, real old, but still great.: As a fan of the Venoms it's tough to rank this on their level. But this movie in it's own right was great. Classic characters, and a great weapon make this movie worth watching. And what can we say about the Evil Master, he was tight. I only wish he would have ripped off more heads. But when he did, it was great.
1	Master of hte flying gullitine: If your into kungfu movie from the1970's. This the film for you. A clasic flim. Worth wotching. A must have movie.
0	STILL HAVE NOT RECEIVED!~: I have contacted the company and have not heard back from them. This is the first time I have had a problem with them but this none the less is an issue. Product paid for, not received. Period. Will make a claim with Amazon.
1	Is it fragile: Anybody worry about breaking this one can go <A HREF=http://feeds.feedburner.com/arstechnica/BAaf?m=932>Here</A> and read their review. A quote: "At this point we were astounded that the iPod nano was still working properly, albeit with a broken display. Because we had honestly expected the iPod nano to break by this time, we were forced to depart from our planned schedule of destruction and try and run over it with the car. Surely, we thought, it could never withstand the crushing power of German automotive engineering."...
0	Waste of money:1st the ipod is expensive. It should at least come with a protective cover. 2nd i rarely used it and only when im in the gym. Quite to often when i go to turn the ipod on it goes into something called "disk mode" which freezes the unit up and cant be played. Theres not hard reset button so i have to go without listening to music for the hour or so im in the gym then take it home plug it in the cpu to get it to unfreeze. Im so pissed at this thing because im all exicted to finnaly listen to some music and get amped in the gym and the dang thing freezes. For the money i spent on this thing it shouldnt happen
0	DO NOT BUY!!!!: iPod Nano's are exceptionally terrible. Do not buy them unless you have a spare $200 to waste. Mine broke in 32 Days, and apple will have nothing to do with the repair. Thanks iPod, for a waste.
1	IPOD NANO: I bought this iPod Nano for my14 year old and he loves it, it's so small and sounds so clear, unbelievable.
0	great product...for the time it lasts: I received an ipod nano 4gb as a gift. It was great other than it got WAY scratched up in about a day of usage. After having it & using it for about 3 weeks, I had it in my pants pocket, when i took my pants off that evening it destroyed the screen. It still worked but the screen was completely damaged. It worked for a good 2 or so months later & then when completely dead. It would be one thing if all these problems came with a cheaper price, but $250 is an insane price to pay for something that will not be sturdy whatsoever & couple possibly give you less than 2 months of usage. I strongly recommend you pass this up & purchase a product that is actually reliable.
1	Protect Your iPod: I got the Nano and ordered an acrylic cover for it from agent18.com. This is the best cover I have seen. It completely protects the nano - especially the screen. Check it out.
1	Fusion of style and functionality: I love my ipod. It is stylish, easy to use, and serves its purpose well. All in all an awesome music player.
1	no envelopes: I like this product and it's easy to use. There are many choices of cards and other projects, but no clearly defined envelop template.
1	path-breaking fiction: Each story reveals bare facts of Victorian life.Devoid of flowery language and overflowing sentimentality that Shelley,Keats,Dickens and others affected.Even compared to today's writers shows great knowledge of sociology,criminology and advances in investigative methods.
1	A wonderful mistery book: I love it. I'm a fan of Sherlock stories, and I think this is the ultimate edition for others like me. It's hard to not keep reading the next page.
0	PRINT WAY, WAY TOO SMALL!!: All the stories of Sherlock Holmes are crammed onto 472 pages (without the T of C), each page measuring10.7" by 7.5". My first impression, on opening the book, was that a gray mist had been sprayed on each page. Looking closer, I realized the gray stuff was the text. I will not subject myself to this sort of eye strain, and suggest you don't either.The previous edition was over1,100 pages. The Amazon preview pages for this volume loaded so slowly I gave up trying to see them, and wasted my money on this illegible copy. Don't buy it, would be my recommendation. Try to find the earlier, green-covered book, with larger print and over twice as many pages.
1	Classic is a classic: Sherlock is a classic. And here you can go along all hystories about it, knowing in deep what happens in the life of this very rare detective.
0	VERY Small Type Makes Reading Difficult (Impossible?): The typeface is very small. This is a problem with buying books online; there is just no way to know if the font used is average-sized and readable -- or excruciatingly tiny and sure to bring on a case of eyestrain. These books are the latter.If microscopic print doesn't bother you, these two are a very nice set in a shelf-box. I'd love them - except I can't see them. Too bad, really.Since there is no preview that can inform a potential buyer as to font-size, I felt my review would focus on this, so as to alert those interested.
0	The Author Has An Odd Fascination: I read this book in law school. The author rejects the whipping post, and instead, recommends administering electric shock to criminals as punishment for crime. What good is that? Shocking someone months after the bad act is committed is not going to create any bad associations or cure any misbehavior.
0	It is for the audience: "Pleasure is the absence of pain" was how one philosopher phrased it, I don't remember who it was, as I was looking out the window at a jaybird when my boy, who has a PHD, was talking it up. Now, I don't know how much shocking or flogging or punching jailbirds will stop them doing their plainfaced bad deeds, but it sure will make a lot US out here feel GOOD. WE didn't get put in prison. Tailgating and backstabbing and firing people because you don't like them and all the mean stuff we enjoy doing out here ain't illegal, and we ain't got CAUGHT at the stuff that IS. YET. Put this corporate punishment on TV, where we can all watch it. Who knows if that fellow DID the stuff they say he did, or whether YOU did it and didn't get CAUGHT, but you can GUARANTEE that you'll FEEL GOOD because it's happening to SOMEONE ELSE.That is my two cents.Review by O. J. Haney.
0	C300 4matic does not fit: This item matches "what fits your car", but caused my car to hesitate, like it had too much/little air.I picked up new filters from the dealer yesterday ...and those were actually1/4" longer...and this fixed my problem.2009 4matic sport.
1	Fits the 2004 Mercedes C240 4matic exactly.: This is an easy install on the 2004 Mercedes C240 4matic and should be similar on the other w203 chassis cars. Open the hood, pull up and forward on the front engine cover, lift the back engine cover, flip the back engine cover, unbolt the torx bolts, remove the old filters, clean the crud out of the area, insert new filters and reverse procedure to re-install. Been using Mann genuine German filters for decades. Great fit and quality.
0	This movie is bad.: And embarrassing. It's not a total loss, no because it can be entertaining...but only once in a while. Sure, the kids will probably like it , and even worse, try to imitate it but really, if you're not 6, 7 or younger, I wouldn't waste your time. That's what this was - a BIG waste of time.And it's so over exaggerated...Ugh.Not recommended.
0	3 ninjas: my favorite one is colt.he`s cool.he kiks those bad guys but.so whatever you do dont fight colt
1	Do you want to see Sasha???: Hi!!!If you would like to see Sasha,go to ebay.She was nice.I liked her clothes.I think Dana is in this collection too.I can`t wait to see her.She looks like the best one in the Genie Magic collection.I soooooo can`t wait for the movie,and I hope the animation is like the Rock Angelz movie.I think it is.By the way,I like Meygan.SARA SIBLINI!!!MY SCENE LOVER!!!BRATZ LOVER!!!*FOREVER*
1	Nice conclusion to the series: After reading the first two stories in this series I was looking forward to this one and wasn't disappointed. Marty while successful in her career has had bad luck in love. Nat with his arrogant background was a great character, how his life changed after his near death experience. I liked how the family intertwined and showed that the Stepp woman while wounded where strong and ended up happy.
1	Love it: When I purchased this book, I expected it to have the script of the show. Now, I know that it is a nice biography about Cameron Mackintosh. You can learn about his life. I expected a bit more about the concert of Hey, Mr. Producer. I expected a program or something. I enjoy reading it.
0	Suspend your disbelief, and then suspend it some more...: Start with a good premise.Then fill it with so many holes that you can drive Mack trucks through it...I found that reading this story only had me thinking that for a heroine who was so smart so often, and able to predict life threatening situations with such great ability, she was certainly unable to see how many ways she could have been eliminated so as to make this story a non-starter.Oh, there it is, it dawns on me that if the other characters could see how easily I do that our protagonist could be snuffed out, then the book would have ended. And that is what should have happened. This book should have died in the slush pile.
0	Cliffhanger ending: I've bought and read all of the books in this series. The story line is pretty good, but the author loves cliffhanger endings. I won't be buying any more in this series.
0	Not brand new as described: I love time trax, and I love collecting movies, the only problem that I have is when I pay a premium price for an item that is supposed to be brand new, but it turns out to be a dv case full of used and scratched/scuffed discs that have obviously seen their way around the break room or wherever some employee decided to watch it. I only come to that conclusion because the item is not from a private seller. It is suppose to be factory direct via amazon. Very disappointing. I begrudgingly will not send it back as I have been waiting a long time for these to be available and I am sure with all o the problems this item has had it probably won't be around very much longer, if you don't care about condition than go for it.
1	Great Story: Sinsiter Enough to make Stephen King cringe ! Dan Simmons is top notch story teller , to say the least .....
0	A poor book: The book is full of little actions and descriptions which don't have much meaning in the story. Looks like they are here for filling the pages.The text would have needed radical cuttings. At one point I even wondered if Simmons had written it himself; but actually it was his first novel.Slow and pointless.
0	Disappointing: After reading the Hyperion and Iluim novels, I approached Kali with high expectations and was frankly disappointed. Maybe I'm jaded by images of human sacrifice, but reading Kali was like reading the novelization of "Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom," minus the comedy.
0	Dark and depressing: This book started out a little depressing and went completely downhill. Likely I was not in the mood to read about the tragedies which occur in this novel but I did not enjoy this read.
0	Xenophobic garbage: I kid you not, the *entire premise* of this book is how inscrutable and exotic and creepy Indian people are...what with their bad hygiene, and the weird food they eat, and their yucky poverty, and their bizarro religion with all those freaky goddesses, and oh yeah, human sacrifice...besides, Calcutta is an EVIL city, do you understand?!?! EEEEEEVIL! EEEEEEVIL!!!Characters in this book repeat different variations on that sentence approximately seven thousand times. Maybe if I could buy into that premise - that Calcutta, a city of more than10 million people, is just EEEEEEEVIL, poisoned by a loathesome and murderous vileness utterly incomprehensible to the rational Western mind - then this book might have scared me. But I don't buy that, because it's stupid xenophobic garbage, and so this book just got on my nerves. I'm sorry you didn't like your vacation in Calcutta, Mr. Simmons. Cripes. Now give it a rest.
1	Literate and Disturbing: ...this is hardly the most frightening book ever written. I wouldn't even put it in the top10. That said, Mr. Simmons has crafted a chilling read. Right from the introduction, I found myself completely seduced by his fictional Calcutta as a den of unspeakable evil. This has stayed with me after reading the book, and I find that I am now drawn to Calcutta in the same way I was drawn to New England after reading H.P. Lovecraft, just to see if it is really that disturbing.The book is extremely enjoyable to read, with an almost literary quality. The author is deft at handling the demands of exposition within the constraints of the first person narration. A few moments ring untrue, but others (including the climax) are just fantastic. Overall the book has the messy feel of a true-life story, which of course makes it all the more disturbing.Highly recommended!
1	Drama Like I Used To Be: Loved the movie, suspense, glamour and melodramatic takes. Hated the little girl (you're supposed to.) Don't shut off the video when it says "The End." The best part is during the ending credits.
1	Terrific Performance By A Wonderful Child Star: Patty McCormack was only a little girl when she appeared in this movie, but she already had plenty of acting experience, having played the same part in the stage version.All of the actors in this wonderful movie do outstanding jobs, but Patty is simply outstanding.The story,as the title suggests, concerns heredity. Does the bad seed of a parent actually pass on and influence his or her child?Aside from Patty's remarkable performance, there are also standout acting jobs done by the wonderful Henry Jones and Eileen Heckart.This is a spellbinding movie, and I never get tired of watching it over and over again.
1	Thank Heaven for Bad Little Girls.: Awesome! Patty McCormack at her best. Everyone I suggest this movie to thinks it is the best movie they ever saw.
1	Great Creepy Movie and Great Shipping: A really creepy movie and a timeless classic. The story behind the making of the film (originally was a play) is very interesting, too. The movie was shipped out quickly and was in perfect condition. Very happy with the purchase.
0	Didn't work on my kindle fire: This is one of my favorite movies to watch with my mom but unfortunately it was very choppy and did not work well on my kindle fire. Amazon refunded me for my purchase though so that's good!
1	Good CD, Beautiful one, Perfect time, perfect sound.: As good, as I expected to be. To me it was what I wanted. Good conditions, Good sound, So, perfect!!. That was the CD I was looking for.
1	Simply the best of the Bee Gees: I've been on a long search for this album and when I finally got it, I can't stop listening. I almost listen two to three times a day to this album, almost more than I listen to my "Still Waters" or "One" or "E.S.P" albums. "Paying The Price Of Love", "Kiss Of Life", "Haunted House", "For Whom The Bell Tolls" and "Fallen Angel" are the best. Maurice takes an great lead on "Omega Man" and "Above And Beyond" and they both rock hard.I would advise any big fan of the Brothers Gibb, to buy this album if you haven't got it yet, because it's really great. Some people say that this is the best album the Bee Gees ever released, that is so true, but "Still Waters" I guess are the best.
1	I love this old-fashioned story: I happened upon this book by accident while cleaning out a garage and I am so glad I did. I had heard of the author years ago but didn't try to read any of her books. I'm glad it was A Lantern In Her Hand that I found.I could not put it down; reading till the wee hours of the dark a.m., about falling asleep with it, only to finish it as soon as I could awaken.I found myself in Abbie Deal's story as a wife, mother, and now grandmother, over and over again. What we give up for and what we do for, our children and husbands goes largely unappreciated, but we would do it all over again just as Abbie would. This story speaks to the heart of every wife, mother, and grandmother. It somehow validates what we have done and why.It is an old-fashioned story and not for you unless you appreciate settling the west in covered wagons on a prairie, living off the land, and learning how to 'make do' with what one has at hand.
0	Bob Hoskins good actor: Can't believe I'm writing a review for this movie.Out of all the flicks I reviewed this is probably the oddest of them all.Well Mermaids isn't my kind of movie ,but I can say I seen it.Bob Hoskins is a great actor and has been in films such as , Roger Rabbit , Enemy at the Gates and Unleashed w/ Jet Li.Mermaids is too soft for me to ever watch , I guess I'm trying to say it's for younger females.
1	A saw every professional and handyman should have: I came to know this type of saw when I was stationed in Japan. Brought back two and unfortunately they finally had their day. Was glad to find this one. Absolutely great!
1	Spoiler Alert: I loved this film- from beginning to end I was caught up in the magic. Much has been made about the ending. I speak as someone who has been through rehab ( a car accident 3 years ago left me a quad). They got the emotions right. You don't have to agree with the choice to realize the love these characters have for each other. Being handicapped means you loose many choices, these characters, this story is about the power given to you by love. And wow- this is a movie that shows the power of an extremely well made film.
0	for scam hollywood is constantly pulling off: a separate price for wide screen/full screen versions?!?!?!?im surprised they dont have a charge for the second disc as well.the movie itself didnt capture my interest.i feel clint is a fine actor and a competent director....but his movies tend to be slow in pace and over rated.again,the1 star is for the ripoff.
1	It is a boxing movie and you should see it: Kept hearing how this was not a boxing movie so I rented it to see for myself. It is a boxing movie and a good story woven into it. I felt a kinship with the character Swank plays (both from poor, trashy, southern backgrounds and trying to overcome that and reach a dream). It is difficult to review this movie without giving away the ending. So if you do not want to know more stop reading, it will not give much away but a small bit.........................the portrayal given by both Swank and Eastwood in making the choices that are made in the last few minutes of the movie are top notch and worthy of all praise to them as actors. I pray never to be on either end....Watch this movie!!!!
0	Dehumanizing.....: This movie blatantly equates man to the level of an animal (a dog to be specific). Instead of emphasizing the fact that man as a person is important and valuable as a creation of God, man is reduced to the level of animal, without a soul. In the movie Clint Eastwood, despite his CLAIMED Catholic faith, decides to murder the boxer that he trained, in the name of being humane. The very purpose of this movie is appalling.
0	A better idea: It would have been more believable if Hillary Swank was a model who falls off the runway and cracks her skull.This movie has no story, no character development, no interesting (barely intelligible) dialogue.How this move could beat 'Sideways' for Best Picture is beyond my comprehension. Mystic River was much better.Hey movie industry, try putting more effort into quality product and maybe box office returns will improve!
0	**contains spoilers**: You know, at the price of movies, it's cheaper to buy the DVD. So I buy the DVD, no problem. But be honest about what I'm getting. I thought I was buying some movie about an against-all-odds underdog woman boxer, not a political statement on euthanasia. And it is so preposterous that Swank's character (This role just reconfirms Swank is a man.) has fought & persisited & trained for all this time & then pow accident decides she will opt for dead in like15 minutes. If I'm supposed to believe her character up until then, I believe her character would want to prove the doctors wrong & fight to walk & even box again. Please, this sucks. Eastwood, don't veil your statements with a boxing movie. Just retire already. The only thing right about it (& I say this about many movies) is having Morgan Freeman on the cast list.
1	Multi-Layered, Spare, Beautiful: Million Dollar Baby seems like a simple story on the surface. It is told sparely, without ruffles or flourishes, but like all great art, has layers of meaning and symbolism.On the surface (and what a vivid surface!) there is the boxing, and Maggie's indomitable spirit, which all her life has helped her fight to survive.There are the relationships, laconic but deep, like slow-flowing rivers; the bones on which the surface lies.And at the movie's heart: there is religious significance. The story becomes one of Christ's parables of the Good Samaritan or the Kingdom of Heaven. And there is a Christ figure. But who is the Christ figure and how can that person save others?It is interesting that some conservative groups find this movie offensive. If they consider it anti-family or anti-religious, they are really missing the point.
1	Eastwood on top of his game: Lean and spare filmaking and storytelling. The problem with movies today is the lack of good movies. Here's a great one. A professional production in every sense of the term.
1	One of my FAVORITE movies!: I own this video and it is one of the best movies in my collections. I've seen it about 50 + times and never get tired of watching certain skating scenes over and over.. not to mention the lovey parts. This is such a sweet movie! Well-written, cute and the actors actually look like their skating. If you enjoy watching Olympic Skating..(and who doesn't) you'll LOVE THIS MOVIE!
1	the cutting edge: gold medal edition: i love the cutting edge i first seen it when i was eight and i remembered it when i looked into one of my pictures when i was five so i looked it up and bought it. i think everyone should see this movie atleast one and if it turns out to be a favorite you should buy it.
0	Boring, and a bad influence, considering its PG: The alchohol scene had no place at all in a PG movie. Some underaged friends of mine intentionally mimicked the lemon-drop shooters scene, to a degree that almost lead to the death of one of them. The movie is boring, predictable, and irritating. Both Moira's character and her trainer have got to go.The Redwings had the right idea but rejecting the character, played by DB Sweeney in the movie. We all should have rejected the entire movie.
1	The sweetest of love stories that you'll watch over & over.: I was so pleased to see the other reviewers felt the way I did about this sappy movie. The chemistry between Kate and Doug is so realistic and the ice skating is excellent. I can watch this movie anytime, again and again and never get sick of it.
1	Better than expected!: After nearly wearing out my VHS copy, I bought this on DVD. The sharp, crisp viewing was a very nice surprise, given my poor old worn-out VHS copy that I'd grown accustomed to.
1	A Masterpiece of the Jazz Age: It is tragic that he isn't more celebrated. This is one of the best books I have ever read, because it works on so many levels: it is a wonderful pot-pourri of character portraits, it's a revealing examination of sociological values at work, and it is a marvelous literary work of a million subtle influences in harmony. It is, in short, a reflection of the motion-pictures that made their appearance at the time, and beyond that, is ripe with biblical allusions wonderfully entwined with the storyline. Dos Passos requires the reader to work, and he should be given more credit for making us do so with so much satisfaction.
1	Good movie: This is a good movie. I would suggest you watch it. Good ideas about mental healthcare and it's practices are portrayed on this movie. Jack Nicholson did a great job too.
1	Archetypes: What a timeless film. As a child you're taught shame and fear. You allow them to be your limiters until one day you wake up, face the worst in yourself and choose freedom. Of course life isn't that straightforward but that's the essence of what I take away from "Cuckoo's Nest". Once your authentic self is awakened you can't choose another's definition of yourself anymore though. It's hard not to relate this1975 movie to Hitler's Germany, or shoot, even things that are happening in 2010.Director Milos Foreman put together an excellent ensemble cast of archetypes with Nurse Rached representing the status quo, McMurphy the rebel, and Chief the voiceless Everyman. All the other patients and warders serve as the Greek Chorus.
1	ONeFlew over the Kuckoo Nest: As ayoung man, (1967)I worked as an Orderly in a hosp and did work on a Psych ward, many people in our America need this care and attention. They are not "bugs" but some little thing can be skewed.
1	Not as good as I thought,but one of the best.: To say the truth,this wasn't a film that I TOTALLY liked.But,however,this is one of the best film ever made.In this world,there's a lot of people who have mental problems.They must be treated in very good care.Like in a hospital.(For example)In this movie,not only the guys who have mental problems have been more insane,but even a ordinary person gets mad being in this special hospital.Their not educating them,but treating them as an animal.All the human rights are gone in this film.Like the Shawshank Redemption.(Maybe Stephen King thought about this novel after watching this movie...)After you see this film,you'll feel blank.Not because it sux,but this flick will give you a good message.This message,you'll know when you see this flick. And one more thing.The acting was NO.1!!!!
1	what i think of one flew over the cockoo's nest: well i think that one flew over the cockoo's nest is a great movie that points out the importance of abnormality in todays society
1	Fabulous recording: This is, from all Händel Concerti Grossi recordings that I know, the most fabulous soul moving experience ever. Just super!
0	Silly junk: Best actor: the dogBest Actress: wasn't in this movieRunning time with banter of witty friends and cocktails:114 minutesRunning time home alone:114 hoursWinner: Worst production values for the yearWinner: Worst copy to DVD - EVER
0	bad, bad, bad: Where to start..graphics hideous, sound terrible, game play buggy. Avoid unless u can get it for under a buck!!! I think I spent 3.00 for it and am using it for a coaster!
1	Raffi is a timeless children's classic.: That's all- Raffi is a timeless children's classic. Easy to sing along to, easy to listen to!
1	Wonderfully Fun!: I don't know who loves this disc more, me or my 3 year old! The Baby claps along too! Great songs that make you smile and tap your toes!
1	Goose vs. Gander: Glenn Smith has really done it this time. Hell hath no fury like the Bushies who have reveled for weeks in the fiction the swift boat people have dished out, only to now see that Smith and Texans for Truth refuse to roll over and play dead without a fight.It's long been said that fiction uncorrected becomes the truth. Kudos to Mr. Smith for bringing truth back into the discussion!
0	Shameless Political Nonesense: No doubt written from the same typewritter CBS used for it's forged memos used in the 60 Minutes show. This is a transparent attempt to steal the amazing popularity of "Unfit for Command" a best seller by John O'Niell and Joe Corsi.
0	for some not others: This book is written by a liberal -and in my opinion-for liberals. If you are a conservative and a fan of Reagan I don't recommend it. Instead, I'd site a work like 'Ronald Reagan' by Dinesh D'Souza.
0	Director's Cut vs Original Release: I have to agree with other reviews regarding the Director's Cut. I have both versions in VHS, and find the original version far superior. I expected that, like VHS, both versions would be available on DVD, but that hasn't happened yet. How do we let the studio know that what we really want is the original version on DVD? I love this movie, but don't really want to buy the Director's cut on DVD, since I consider it inferior. Thanks...
1	One of the single greatest films of all time, released in flawless HD X 5!!!!: Where to begin? Blade Runner is one of the single greatest films of all time. If this movie was simply the Final Cut released with no Special Features it would still be a five star item. However, with the 9 hours of special features and five versions of the film, all in glorious, glorious1080P this item can truthfully be described as one of the finest film deals available on the market. If you haven't already done so, order this item promptly, it belongs in the Blu Ray Collection of any fan of good movies, and especially any fan of science fiction. The transfer to Blu Ray is phenomenal as it the sound. It is kind of a bummer that the special features are not in HD but that is such a minor point compared to all of the high points of this item that you should not allow it to prevent you from acquiring this item promptly. Simply the best!
0	ZzZzZzZzZz...: Everyone says its so great! I must have been watching a different movie. When it comes to movies I am one of those people that generally likes everything for what it is, if nothing else. This would have to be the exception to the rule. Boring, slow, cheesey effects, almost no plot, and the ending was unfulfilling at best. I've only seen the directors cut so I guess I can't appreciate the 'improvement', but whats so good about a polished version of a fundementally bad movie? Its like taking a class in remedial reading and getting an A; sure its an A, but its not a very tough class.
1	Director cuts out the good stuff: I have to disagree with the director and with Amazon. The voice-over was great and lent character and atmosphere to the original. Of course, the ending is better and there are some interesting new scenes with Sean Young and Harrison Ford, but Ford's voice and the Vangelis score melded into a wonderful future film noir experience.
0	How do you get the closed captioning to work?: Closed captioning not available...bummer! Luckily, I still have an older DVD which does have closed captioning. This purchase was a waste of money!
0	I would give it zero stars if i could.: Unbelievably terrible movie, and a terrible transfer. I'd go into more detail, but that would require that i think about the movie again, and i refuse to make myself do that.
0	am i the only one who...: Am I the only one who prefers the original version? Harrison Ford's voiceover added to the film's noir feel, and filled in a few background details that made the story more understandable. Perhaps creative folk are loath to admit that studio execs are sometimes right, even if it's for the wrong reasons. In addition, I LIKE happy endings, and so do most people, which is why moviemakers do them so much.
0	Check Your Discs!: Search the Web for "blade runner blu-ray disc return" and you'll find many people who got mislabeled duplicate discs. Amazon.com will help you out if you check the discs soon enough and find an issue, but if you wait too long Warner Brothers doesn't help. I have called multiple numbers that lead to message recorders. Nobody responds.Check your discs right away; Amazon is your only return option! If you have a bad disc and have waited too long, WB doesn't care.
0	Horrible DVD - Video quality is like unto ancient rental VHS: The movie is great the quality of this DVD is horrible. It appears to shimmy and shake as if someone were sitting in a theater with a camcorder. Very displeased with this purchase - should be sold in the $1 bin not as a $10 item. You would be better off with VHS or perhaps LaserDisc. Wait for the rumored forthcoming "definitive" DVD release by Ridley Scott the director.
1	Director's Cut makes the cut: When Ridley Scott released Blade Runner in1982, it showed the world how well the future may look like. Almost a decade later, a Director's Cut was made, and up to now I can never get over the future appearance of Los Angeles. I have to say, the Director's Cut was a lot better, especially the ending. This is definitely one of Ridley Scott's best movies, besides Alien, and provided a great role for Harrison Ford. The visuals are amazing, and has some of the best music by Vangelis. Sci-Fi fans should really invest into seeing this one.
0	A less than stellar DVD: First off the Director's Cut blatantly disregards most of the book especially at the end. But since I am inclined to base my rating on the DVD itself, I'll not count that against it. My big complaint with Bladerunner is that the movie was released with two versions and only one is present on the DVD. Thus, the viewer is forced to watch the Director's Cut. The DVD is also a little shy on extras. The movie itself isn't too bad, although its pace is a tad slower than many other good science fiction movies and may cause many viewers to become bored. I suggest holding off on purchasing this DVD as it is rumored to be scheduled for re-release around December of this year. Hopefully the new release will have both versions of the film and the additional extras such a famous film deserves
1	AMERICA'S CRITIC: I LOVED THIS ONE IT WAS PRETTY AWESOME MY FULL REVEIW WOULD JUST BE A WASTE JUST OWN THIS MOVIE AND THATS THAT!!!!
1	excellent Blue Ray movie: This 5 disk set for $27 is a good deal. 3 blue ray disks and two DVD disks are in the box.
0	A true classic that deserves better...: Bladerunner is still one of the finest cyberpunk movie ever made(Fifth Element don't even come close). When it was first aired, there were so may versions of the film. In my opinion, the European version is the best. It certainly has a lot more violence but it made the movie much clearer with Ford's narration and the happy ending that made the film less depressing than it already is. Sadly the DVD lacks all this offering us the director's vision only. Strangely the Criterion Edition LD(which offers the European version)has not made it to the DVD. This is sad considering that Ridley Scott's Legend is given a better treatment on DVD offering two versions of the film in a Collector's Edition(the fantastic director's cut and the horrible U.S version). Hopefully, Bladerunner will be rereleased with both European version and director's cut in the near future(and possibly a 'making of' documentary as well).
1	Old vs. New: While received poorly at the box office upon first release, Blade Runner has entrenched itself in the collective minds of moviegoers. Its greatness is evident by the number of new releases who continue to borrow visually from Blade Runner (A.I. and Dark City are prime examples). It is a shame Ridley Scott didn't devote more time to the sci-fi genre, instead of giving us "classics" such as White Squall, GI Jane and Hannibal. That aside I must agree with some of the other reviewers. I too enjoy the director's cut more, but would've liked to have seen both versions available. Each version has its own admirable qualities, but I think the narrated original is better for the casual viewer. I tend to straddle the fence of movie snob and "Joe Popcorn" and would like to have the option of watching either version as my mood dictates. And in all honesty, the narrated version is probably the only one I could get my girlfriend to watch.
0	@@@@ WARNING @@@@@: BUYER BEWARE ! i ordered this 5 disc blu ray from usa. now i wished i hadn't. it started out being cheaper than ordering from my country canada. it arrived today and disc 5 had a huge crack all the way from the top layer to the bottom. the crack runs from the inner hole to the outside edge. also my first disc is the wrong workprint copy instead of the final cut. i wished i'd read these reviews first. shame on amazon for shipping known defective products !
1	Amazon needs to sell the original version: The directors cut is very disappointing. The original with the voice over is better - it fits the piece better as does the music - and even the supposed happy ending is better because that happy ending is tempered by ford's character saying he didn't know how long they'd have together, but then again, who does...
0	new dvd: Warner Bros.! Please release Bladerunner in 5.1 Dolby and 2.0 Dolby surround. what's the point of making a DVD if it's not going to have the quality of a DVD? That's the whole reason in buying them.
1	Another great movie to bring back great memories: Another fantastic movie that came around at a time when this kind of thing was a lot more possible in peoples' imagination than it is nowadays.Great actors, great movie. I'll be watching this one probably a few times a year just because it's that good (so much better than the garbage coming out of Hollywood for the last decade!).
1	HD-DVD Final Cut review: This is a review of the HD-DVD Blade Runner Final Cut only. To put it in prospective I have the Laser Disk and the Director's Cut on DVD.If you have an upscaling DVD player then there is not too much visual improvement to the orginal Director's Cut DVD. What has really improved is the Dolby 5.1 sound. The improvement in the sound quality in the regular Director's Cut to a HD-DVD,Blu-Ray, Regular DVD Final Cut is great.The opening scene when the ships pass over the city, first from front to back L, then from back to front,R, are grealty improved in rear sound quality.Your ears will feel the diference.
0	Bring back the Theatrical Release: I saw the original theatrical release of Blade Runner and was dismayed years later to learn that the director's cut omits Harrison Fords narrative. Why was the narrative removed? I don't get it.... I want to buy a new, high quality DVD based on the original Blade Runner release where Harrison Ford narrates.... To me, the movie just isn't the same without the narrative sound track.
0	Studio Got Lazy On This One: Warner Bros. shouldn't have released the Director's Cut by itself. They should have released a Criterion Collection containing the Director's Cut, as well as the Original Trailer, the extra violence only seen overseas, the footage cut from the Workprint (such as the Holden in the Hospital scene, and Zhora's snake dance) and maybe a Director's Commentary since almost every other Ridley Scott DVD has one! The fact of the matter is that there are way too many extra features never before seen to produce a DVD as bare-bones as this one is. Personally i would love to see the trailer, the hospital scene, and the extra violence but unfortunately this basic DVD is all that's out there.
0	I don't understand the hype.: With all the hype this movie is supposed to be like the best movie ever. It's just okay but with such high expectations I'm not impressed.It gets an extra star because it has a very beautiful woman and a good soundtrack.
0	still searching: is it possible to buy the original theatrical version of blade runner on dvd without buying the 5 disc set????
1	No.1 cult movie: This one has it all;sci-fi,action,mystery and is truly one of a kind.An unforgetable masterpiece that has earned a special place in my collection.
1	Bladerunner special edition is awesome.: This is impossible to find in Brick&Mortar's anymore, was a breeze to find and order on Amazon, and got it quickly. Also, this is probably one of the best DVD special editions I've picked up in a long time.
1	Blade Runner: This movie is not one of the greatest sci-fi movies ever done, it's one of the greatest movies ever done, movies like this should be topping all time box office charts, (this movie barely gave any profit when originally released). Harrison Ford chose wisely when commiting to this project another great movie, director Ridley Scott transports us to the future, I wish so badly that time could be changed and this movie would have made lots of money and spawned a couple of good quality sequels. K.W. Jeter wrote three novels that are sequels to this movie, check the first novel Blade Runner 2: The Edge Of Human.
0	ZERO star rating: I probably should have payed closer attention to what the "directors cut" did not include. I thought the other version with Sean Young and Harrison Ford flying off together was definitely a four star rating. And that unicorn dream sequence? Whats up with that? My advice... don't waste your money on this one.
1	oh, the french *sigh*: Great movie. However, does the french guy not realize the entire point of the movie? He toyed with some of the less important points yet failed to comment on the unicorn. *sigh*hmmm...I didn't write this...but the movie is quite good. The directors cut lacks in many areas however. I would suggest purchasing the original. sorry for the above...I kinda like the french =)
1	The Best Sci-fi Movie Ever: Blade Runner (director's cut) has to be my favorite movie; it's special effects and setting are still visually stunning after 20 years, plus the breathtaking soundtrack and story make it a feast for the senses. Very few films can stand the test of time this well, and I cannot gush about this movie enough. It is a work of art.
1	Really good pursuit, action film: I liked the whole concept of this movie -A bounty hunter in the future, played by Harrison Ford, is told to terminate four replicant beings.Based on a novel by Philip K. Dick, Hampton Fancher and David Webb Peoples (who also wrote UNFORGIVEN) did a very good jobe with the screenplay.Ridley Scott directed and gives us some exciting, albeit brutal, pursuits. Scott seems to be very good at this kind of genre film, or action films.Harrison Ford is perfect in the lead role.Sean Young, Edward James Olmos, M. Emmet Walsh, Daryl Hannah and the other actors also are perfect in their roles.The music by Vangelis and the cinematography by Jordan Cronenweth are excellent.
0	Missing something...: Why don't they take Lawrence Sanders' name off the McNally books? Vincent Lardo obviously hasn't studied them in depth, since he makes mistakes with reference to Sanders' stories. Archy states he doesn't want to get married if he can't have a marriage as perfect as his parents. Lardo apparently is unaware that the "pater" had an affair in one of Sanders' installments! Archy isn't quite the same guy and is becoming quite the annoying snob. Al Rogoff was hardly in this one and I missed him. Archy's living with a girlfriend and there are few references to the McNally "manse", dinners with the folks, etc. And the climax was anything but; a true anticlimax that was over before I realized. Time to hang up the series? I do believe.
1	Byrds rock the fillmore: Byrds live at the fillmore is a great live album from the byrds at Fillmore east and features some of the best songs performed live amd is highly recommended.
1	Story Not As Good As "What's Up, Doc?", But Still Very Funny!: Hillary Kramer (Barbra) is a successful Perfume magnate, when she finds out that her accountant has robbed her blind and left for South America. Going through all of her remaining assets she finds a boxer, purchased as a tax write off. She decides to take Eddie Scanlon (Ryan O' Neal) who is much more at home giving driving lessons, into the ring and use him as her key to riches. Eddie thinks this will only get him killed, but Hillary won't give up that easy, nor will Eddie give up that easy from never fighting again. The story lacks originality and farce, which gave "What's Up, Doc?" it's brilliance. However Barbra & Ryan are in top form & they are still great and hilarious together!.
1	GREAT TALENT: THIS CD GOES TO SHOW THAT THERE IS MORE THEN ONE TALENT IN THE GROUP PUBLIC ENEMY A GREAT CD WITH SOME GREAT BASS AND RYMES
0	a typical mainstream album: i heard why and times up and welcome to d block, and i really liked them, anyone i knew that bought it said it was amazing, so i thought it might acually not be as wack as tha rest of tha stuff ppl are puttin out these days.....but i was sadly mistaken, those where tha only good tracks tha rest is unoriginal, unreal, and hes talkin about ice, rims, girls, and killen ppl, he actually says he is rapping for fame on one part of tha album.....THIS IS HIP POP NOT HIP HOP, not for real hip hop fansP.S. Idont know why i even bought it
0	what the hell did he just say: Why did Bush knock down the towers??I can't believe he said that sh*t.This guy is an idiot, screw his lyrics, f**k this guy.That song 'Why' sucks anyways. Many of us know about the struggle, I don't need to hear him bitch and cry about it.
1	"Good Carpenter Documentary DVD!": John Carpenter: The man who brought you "Halloween," Escape from New York"& more! This dvd that has everything you want to know about the famousdirector with many cast & crew interviews. I'm a big fan and own justabout all of his films. I recommend this good dvd.
0	many flaws outweigh fun: The game includes nowhere to store the black sheets for the "screen". The storage drawer jams every time you close it so opening it tends to result in pegs flying all over the room. You can turn the light on but not off; I seem to recall that we had on/off light technology even way back when I was a kid. The pegs don't stay in well, the blue pegs tend not to glow at all unless they're directly above the light bulb.You'd think with many generations of children to evolve and perfect this toy it would have gotten better rather than worse; your expectations would be frustrated.
0	Over-Hyped: Despite the advertising, I would say that this book is of little or no use to all but the beginning investor who wants a very easy to manage entry/exit system. I could replicate the "extensive historical research" that these "prominent authors" have performed for their systems in less than a few days and I'm no expert.There are more pages of text devoted to the history of Fidelity and to an overview and explanation of the Select Funds (the only useful chapter in the book for me) than to the 3 "powerful mutual fund models". The "computer programs" included on disk are nothing more than incredibly simple spreadsheet templates.I'm not sure if the authors are bull-market opportunists or just naive, but their book was/is a great disappointment to me.
0	TOO LAME!!: I think it is pathetic that both parties go at it here in the review section. I look to read customer reviews. Boycott outside of WB studios if you two have issues. I doubt there are really that many people distressed by the dvd's lack of commentary!! And NO, I DON"T WORK FOR WB OR KNOW ANYONE WHO DOES. Let consumers post the reviews!!
1	They should hav had more stuff!: the dvd's sound really great and i give it a 4/5 rating with all the extra stuff in it but it could have been a 5! they should have put those 3 video clips that started all this ! i wanted to see "American History", "Jesus vs. Frosty", and "The Spirit of Christmas" on thoses dvd's! maybe theres still time to cram these video clips in the dvd's!
1	Classic South Park Goodness...Nothing More, Nothing Less: I don't know why so many people are complaining about this DVD set. You knew what you were getting from the get go. If someone is thinking about this set, let me clarify:-There is nothing mentioned about "Uncensored Episodes". The only thing uncensored are the special features & the lead-ins for each episode. If you're expecting more, don't buy it.-Its the ENTIRE first season collected in one low-cost set. Yes these episodes are already available on DVD, but now the whole first year is in a collected set, and previously mentioned, cheaper than buying the separate DVDs.-Also, the commentary. Evidentially, it was SOOO controversial that it had to be REMOVED from the DVDs! Now you can get them by sending in the UPC, which I know is a pain, but from what I hear, its worth it!-Lastly, ITS SOUTH PARK! Any true fan will buy this set & like it without crying.I frankly can't wait for the next season! South Park: Buy it...Watch it...Love it!
1	Great start, great middle, okay finish: This book started out in a way that I could not put it down. It was a very interesting and well written beginning. Unfortunately, the narrative broke down a bit towards the end. I was able to predict what was happening about100 pages before everything was explained. To me this lessens the quality of the book.However, much of the information on psychology given in the book was absolutely fascinating since I do not have any sort of background in it.
1	Read the last150 pages in one sitting: I was so into this book I read the last150 pages in one sitting.
0	Awful piece of junk!: My son wanted this toy so badly for his birthday. I finally found the only one in town and it is a disaster. How difficult would it have been for the designers to actually figure a way for the arms to lock in place?? They do not stay in the back at all. This toy has since caused tears and frustration. Don't buy this piece of junk!
0	Not reader friendly: I should have paid attention to other reviews. Was looking forward to reading selected works by Edgar Allen Poe on my Kindle but determined immediately that it was impossible to go to a specific selection. This has been set up like that of a novel. If the reader wants to go to a certain selection scanning through every page to get to that selection is required. Using the Go To feature on the Kindle was not helpful either since a location for each story/subject was not indicated in the Table of Contents. I have read much of Poe's works previously and was looking forward to revisiting his genius but have to say that this Kindle Edition is not even worth the $0.99 that I paid for it. Will probably just delete it.
0	Unorganized impossible to navigate: Save your dollar. The kindle edition does not have any ability to easily navigate. You will essentially have to manually wade through the extensive collectioin of Poe stories which is cubersome and ineffecient. As well, this edition was linked next to a volume for stories and poems and the kindle edition only has stories.
1	This joint gets10 mikes: For 80deca, true school hip hop fans, this is one of tightest albums feturing 2 unsung, caucasion MC's who simply can rip a mike. Prime Minister Pete Nice and MC Search compliment each other like peanut butter does jelly.10 years later, this album still sits in my tape player. Big ups to all those who are still avid fans!
1	These aren't my clothes...: When friends come over for movie night, the first thing I always ask them is; have you ever seen 'True Romance'? It is always my first pick out of the1100 movies I own, when company comes. It is Tony Scott's masterpiece, and the best thing Quentin ever wrote. Over the top, way way violent, and unforgettable performances by a star-studded cast. So many memorable lines to add to the pop culture. And am still amazed at how unknown this film is to movie fans! Tony Scott will always be remembered as a high octane film maker. One who could make sense out of the kinetic editing process, to give us many thrills. Thanks for the wild ride Tony, may you rest in peace.
1	One of my favorites: Written my Tarantino this film is one of my favorites and my favorites of his. Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette are excellent in it, it's a fun, very 90's wild romp! It'll make you want to go on a road trip and talk in a Southern accent. Oh - and do it in a phone booth.
0	Check what region your in....: Love the movie and wanted it in my collection but it came from England and wouldn't play in my DVD player.
1	A DVD review: This DVD doesn't have much to offer other than a great movie with a bunch of cameos from some big name actors. A good DVD to have in the collection if you liked the film.
1	A classic: I grew up listening to Raffi, so my mother naturally bought this CD for my 7 month old son, when he was 4 months old. The CD is a lot of fun to sing to, and when he's fussy all I need to do is sing the first line of "The More We Get Together", "Five Little Frogs", or "Aikendrum" and he smiles right away and cheers up. I'd recommend it for parents who are looking for fun and simple songs to sing to their children.
1	Great songs! Our children love Raffi: If you haven't been introduced to Raffi, what are you waiting for! Our boy and girl love the books and the songs. Anything Raffi is generally a hit with them. My recommendation to parents or grandparents is to take time to learn the songs and sing the books - you will entertain your children and they will consider you a rockstar! The CD and/or books make great gifts too!
1	I LOVE this CD (oh, and so do my kids): I think this is one of the BEST Raffi cd's. I purchased it on a whim, not really sure which children cd i should buy. Well, my kids (2 and 5) LOVE this cd!!! The songs are really catchy and we find ourselves singing them throughout the day without the cd playing. Even my husband sings them. I really enjoy this cd and have since purchased another Raffi cd, which my kids also enjoy.
0	I know he's popular -- but I can't stand to hear his voice!: I know that Raffi is one of the most popular kid's singers. You can't go into a kids music section without seeing his face everywhere. I tried to like him, I really did. But his voice annoys the heck out of me. Doesn't anyone else notice that this guy can't sing? Yuck.Buy Kimbo's "Six Little Ducks", or Greg & Steve's "Big Fun", or Joanie Bartels "Bathtime Magic". In short, buy anything else!
1	ruler in the rapgame: foreshadowed and epitomized the pimpster attitude of many rappers during the late '80s and '90s,with gold chains, his eye-patch.Whit his irreverent,humorous,smart and rebellious style he is the King in the rapgame. bye all his albums!!
1	love it but 4 stars not 5: Although this show is very fascinating I find every episode to be almost the same. Starting with Morgan Freeman stating "when I was a young boy..." then something he did to get in trouble, or something he witnessed that ruined his fragile eggshell mind. Followed by rhetorical questions and theories, and tons and tons of examples. The examples even have examples. Maybe I just understand this stuff and the show really dumbs it down, but I feel like I wasted money investing in season 3. Which by the way, although not currently available, (I don't have cable and I still had the privilege of watching this before the DVD came out) but I will still probably end up buying it on DVD which is cheaper than I already paid for the electronic proprietary/DRM version on Amazon Unbox.
0	Doesn't Matter: The first 2/3 of this movie are spent developing the characters of Liu Xing and Prof Reiser and then all the strongest character traits of those two people are just tossed aside for the ridiculous ending. That made the entire film a complete waste of time. You're left wondering what moron wrote that idiotic ending and why. Anyone with a shred of intellect isn't going to be moved by this except maybe to anger at having squandered 90 minutes on it. It could have been a decent movie. It did have a really cheap quality about it as you never see ANY other students at the school.
1	great movie!!: Very powerful and artistic movie, but a sad story.Ye Liu is a great actor and the character he played was a scary guy!
0	Not one of her better ones!!: As I have a collection of all of Meryl Streep's movies, I added this one but upon watching it couldn't really get into it. Found it rather gruesome, weird and sad. To me it was not one of her better movies so I would not recommend it.
0	Defected Book!:1 star because the book was deffected!This book arrived on time and was in excellent condition. Upon reading the book to my daughter I noticed the pages were out of order. Please contact me so that I may persue getting another copy.
1	Excellent and Interesting: This book is a highly readable work of scholarship, showing us a huge slice of humanhistory that is often hidden and suppressed in our culture - that of the jockeying forpower at the juncture of several very archetypal and powerful issues in our culture-gender, health, and power. Anyone who wishes to truly understand the contemporary statusof natural healing and our current corrosive corporate politics should read this enjoyableand insightful book.
0	HOLY JESUS!: What the (blank) happened to Pete Nice? I had always wondered what happened to the Prime Minister after 3rd Bass imploded. I knew Serch put out a CD but I never even knew Pete did until recently. Sadly.... now I know why! I could barely even listen to this CD and haven't touched it since. If you wore out your 3rd Bass tapes back in the day and want to hear Prime Minister in action again... Just get the 3rd Bass CD's and forget this crap! Oh don't believe me?? Check out how much it's selling for.***UPDATE***01/24/13I've listened to this CD several hundred times since 2005 and I'll admit it.... I WAS WRONG! The Lumberjack, The Rhapsody (in J minor), Kick the Bobo and Blowin' Smoke! Pete was getting down like Charlie Brown! Guess I was so used to 3rd Bass I just couldn't hear it. This one is a gem buy it.
1	4.5 stars actually: first of all, you need to buy good batteries for this camera. I bought a100-pack of cheapies and they don't last but a few hours- if they work. Good batteries like energizer will last you a few weeks. I own a Mac and the pictures transfer easily onto iphoto. the 4x optical zoom is a nice improvement from our other 3x zoom on our sony. I was able to buy a 2GB memory card for $20(sandisk) from here also. There are also high speed cards available. I'm already satisfied with the standard one. I don't do a lot of "quick" shots anyways.Only one drawback. The video doesn't show up on my imovie. maybe I need more experimenting. I just assumed it would be as easy as the pictures.Overall, I am surprisingly satisfied with this canon product. Especially after being a sony fan for years.
0	Avoid this seller!: We ordered this camera for our daughter. We have never had any issues with having things arrive from Amazon sellers but this camera came to us in a flat rate envelope wrapped in bubble wrap. Nothing else. No original box either, nothing except the SD card that still had someone else's personal pictures on it. The box was pretty much flattened in the mailing process and the cameras' internal lens was totally crushed. When we contacted the seller we were told that's how he always mails things and never had any issues in the past. He even neglected to respond when we asked for at least a credit for another camera. I understand that things get lost/damaged in the mail but to send a camera through the mail without much more than one sheet of bubble wrap and the mailing envelope is ridiculous! Save yourself the frustration, time and money - buy elsewhere.
1	Canon Powershot digital camera: I bought this camera as a gift for my daughter. She absolutely loves it! The pictures are sharp and clear, and the camera is so easy to use.My daughter loves all the features on it. We would buy this camera again, maybe for myself next time!
0	workmanship: The workmanship in this 6th Edition is less than satisfactory. Several of my fellow seminar students had their books split upon opening the front cover of the hardback. Apparently, the inside of the cover and first page are defective, either in material or application. My copy has not split yet. However, it is obvious that there is stress and it is just a matter of time. I hope the appropriate person at Amazon reads this.
1	An Essential Book: There are very few books that are essential for one's personal library, but this book qualifies. One can argue the point, but you are pretty safe in saying that Shakespeare is the great writer of all-time. This collection of his works is magnificently edited by David Bevington. If you've never read anything by Shakespeare or read and re-read him a million times, you shouldn't be without this anthology.
1	This is what i'm waiting for!!!!: In Flames and Soilwork are sold out, so my only chance to find another album that blow my mind like Dark Tranqility's "Character", is this. This album is solid musicianship throghout. There's no filler here or the commercial flavor like the other two(In Flames, Soilwork), this is great melodic death metal with no complaints!!! There's industrial touches like in "Character", but sounds really good. Check this out, you won't regret it.
0	Disappointing Book: What about reading about an artwork:"This painter is in its best. His paint is full of movement and color, and it represents the best of this period of the art."And then you look for the picture and did not find it. Or in the best case scenario, you find a small, black and white, pale picture of the paint.That's what happens in this book.Disappointing :-(
0	Interesting but with one MAJOR flaw: An interesting author who knows his art but I found this a frustrating book to read because Hoving describes one great piece of artwork after another but only a small number are actually illustrated. Even a bad picture is better than no picture. The author tries his best but the beauty of words just don't measure up to the beauty of the artwork. Next time, the publisher should spend a couple of extra bucks and put in a few more pictures for us dummies out there who are not as knowledgeable as Hoving. They have, to their credit, included some nice color pages in the front and end of the book.
1	GREAT SOUND...GREAT VALUE: It was time to replace my 25 year old Technics towers. I wanted something much smaller, without giving up the great sound I was accustom to. I listened to a lotta speakers from Bose, Wharfdale, Polk, and for the money, these were by far the best. Good bass, crisp highs & rich midrange sound. I'm very happy with these & I hope they last as long as my last set.
1	Very nice: I got these speakers promptly and they are indeed a first class product. The first thing I noticed was howheavy they are. These things must have some serious magnets in them. FWTW. They really do sound good thoughSony nailed this deal.
1	Exceptional speakers: Recently bought the Sony SS-B3000 speakers. As many have mentioned are a little larger than most bookshelf speakers. However, these speakers are an exceptional value for the money. Plus they sound fantastic, clear highs, smooth mid-range and good bass response. Most music lovers will be satisfied with the sound and these are also nice looking speakers. You cannot go wrong.
0	Sony Speakers: Ordered Sony Speakers per a good review online. They arrived on time, but did not satisfy my ears. Their sound was adequate, but I planned to use them for listening to vinyl albums and like a crisp sound. I returned them and ordered Bose 301's which work great for me. Thank you.
0	Reading this book was hardly worth the struggle.: Lucia Robson St.Clair's novels have always been in the "can hardly put it down" catagory but this recent novel"Mary's Land" set in early Maryland history was a struggle to read. The story began with the promise of another wonderful historical drama but after the main characters landed in the colonies and began their new life,the story started to wander and never seemed to find its footing again.I was discouraged but glad to read comments from other readers. I learned I was not her only fan who must have been shaking their heads and furrowing their brows as they struggled through this recent novel by a favored author.
1	Byrds Untitled originally vinyl 2 LP set.: The Byrds UntitledA valuable part of my Byrds music library that used to have as a vinyl 2 LP set. I am rebuilding the Byrds music library with CDs.
1	THREE AND A HALF STARS, (there are no half stars): Paula Cole's CD, Amen, certainly does not have the same caliber music as her previous one. By far her best one so far has been Harbinger. Amen has at times very cliche lyrics, but her guitar and drummer are both great on this album, (most people reviewing seemed to forget that it is now the Paula Cole BAND). I do like some of the songs, and DJ Premier is a fine DJ. All and all it is a swell album, and I would recommend it.
1	I loved this CD!: In moments of creativity, you can only hope to put as much of yourself as possible in your work. That's what Paula Cole has achieved with "Amen". In this eclectic mix of funk, pop tunes, and bluesy numbers, you not only hear and feel her struggle for love, inner peace, political righteousness, and a life of spiritual meaning - you want it too. Honestly, there are a few "fillers" in the album, hence the 4 star rating. But with evocative tracks such as "I Believe in Love", "Amen", "Pearl" and "Be Somebody", these "fillers" are forgiven. In short, Paula Cole offers a musical reflection of herself and ourselves as well in our struggle for harmony in our personal relationships, our humanitarian responsibility in the world, and our spiritual balance in the universe.
1	A different album from Paula- yet a much needed one.: I'm a little surprised that so many people would come on to post such negativities about this new album or about Paula herself. I have been a fan of hers for well over 3 years, and will continue to be. This is a remarkable, powerful, and unusual album. It's great. She does a remarkable job both in her compositions, her vocals, and her lyrics. Hey, and to all you people out there who, like me, support Paula in this effort, remember one thing about some of these negative and weird comments from people; remember that not everyone is blessed with intelligence!
0	Paula Morissette?: This is Ms. Cole's worst offering. I totally loved "This Fire" and most of "Harbringer". This album is laced with Mariah Carey sounding vocals (who's doing the high stuff? - NOT Ms. Cole), Alanis 90's disco grooves, and Dr. Dre sounding beats. Her lyrics I might give 2 stars to, but there very self-centered and pretentious most of the time. This was a drag becuase I have been a fan of Paula's since her days with Peter Gabriel - but this "Amen" album is terrible. I was totally dissapointed. Thanks for selling out, Paula.
0	sucks: overrated fan. just go to lowes or home depot and save money and get something you can return in person.
1	Miracle cure: I have suffered from insomnia for close to 8 years. After trying every herbal remedy available, I finally reached for Ambien. After two years of Ambien use, I still struggled with a decent night sleep, battling depression as a side-effect of the drug.Last month I ordered Roberta Shapiro's Sleep Solutions CD and am so glad I did! For the first time in years, I am able to go to sleep and stay asleep. The CD offers recordings for the purpose of falling asleep, as well as some shorter recordings to equip the listener to get back to sleep easily if sleep gets interrupted.I find Roberta's voice very calming, and she clearly has a great understanding of what insomniacs have to overcome. If you struggle with sleep issues, this CD is a wonderful solution.
1	Excellent: This is an excellent sleep aid. Although my sleeep problem had not been fallng asleep, I find this CD helps me fall into a deeper sleep. Although I have experienced periods of wakefulness during the night, using this CD has meant that the wakefulness is far less. I went from 40-50% wakeful to 5-15% wakeful. It is very seldom now that I get out of bed during the night. Highly recommended.
1	Impressive Sleep CD: I have finally found an effective safe method of getting a restful night's sleep. I would highly recommend this CD to anyone who has ever had a fitful night's sleep.Jonathan Rubin, MD
1	Perfect Background Music for a Bachelor's Pad: While "Night Lights" would be perfect for a romantic evening, it also stands up well to serious examination. The original Philips vinyl LP is fairly rare now, but was one of my most valued jazz albums. It sure is nice that the jazz catalog CD re-issue wave is including this beautiful work of art. Bobby Brookmeyer on valve trombone, Jim Hall on guitar, Art Farmer on trumpet and of course Gerry Mullgan on baritone sax are at the top of their form in this early1960's small big band date. This was recorded shortly after the Concert Jazz Band period for Mulligan and further testifies to his abilities as a top-notch arranger. You might also check out these earlier big band recordings on Verve - Gerry Mulligan and The Concert Jazz Band "Live At The Village Vanguard" is the one most accessible currently, although there are others to be found on CD.
0	High Hunt by David Eddings: Not a too great book, at least not nearly as good as"The Malloreon", "Elenium" or "Tamuli" which are all very good books. Very exiting and reads easy!
0	Waste Of Money!: A lot of the book was based on any breed. In the training section, it was hard to understand what they were saying. I own two Chis of my own and thier behavior was not as nearly bad as the book described the attitude! I might as read a book about German Shepards!
0	Don't do it.: When I built my computer, I was stupid and wanted it to be obnoxiously illuminated and filled with cathode lights and LED's and EL wire. I regret all that now, and I also regret this mouse pad. It's bulky but provides little room, the colors are a stupid novelty that wear off after a day or two, and it absolutely kills teflon feet.
1	In a class all his own: I learned a lot about playing blues piano from listening to Ray Bryant (not that I know1/100th of what Bryant knows....). Bryant has a style all his own. He is a master cook. All the tracks on this classic disk swing, and the trio musicians are in perfect sync with each other. This is pure jazz with its roots in the blues, pure joyful inventiveness and rhythm - which is what jazz is all bout. (There is NO harmonica on this album.)
1	Perfection: I, the instant I saw an episode of the Zoid series, thought that it was completely awsome!!! Zoids is100% better than "Yu-Gi-Oh!" or "Pokemon" or "Digimon." It is totally cool. Once you see, it you'll love it.
1	my 2nd fav. by her: I love Laura Ingalls Wilder as an author. I think her books are interesting and well written. Her descriptions of events, places, people, and time periods cannot be beat and it draws you right in.
0	Poor Customer Service: I bought the 4gig memory and only one worked. Tried to return it and was given the run around for almost two months. They told me to send it to amazon, amazon told me to send it them and back and forth. I was going to spend a little more and buy something different from them but after all the hassle, NO WAY.
1	Cat's Eye: This is one of the many Stephen King classics. Definately should be on DVD for future generations to enjoy. A riveting tale of a cat's quest to teach errie lessons and save the day. Looking forward to the DVD!
1	Scooter Mirror: This is a well made and super easy to install mirror, after receiving the first one I ordered a second for the other side.
1	Solid and sharp: I had to cut the grip on my handlebars to install the mirror but it works great. It looks solid and visibility is excellent. Tightened up secure, instructions were easy. I like it.
1	Best Mirror on the Market!: My Mirrycle MTB is now on it's second bike. I did have to replace the mirror part after dropping the bike...no fault of the mirror itself. It stays in place and gives a wide view of what's behind you.
1	Nice mirror for the price, but you may need to lube the cap screws: I was looking for a simple mirror that wasn't too expensive and this one did just that. I was also interested in something that would not break if the bike tipped, so the option to mount this toward the "inside" of the handlebar instead of the outside was attractive to me.I noticed some of the negative reviews centered on the mounting "screws" being too tight and of a non-standard size. I found this to be true for me as well. The cap screws would only go in a couple turns before binding up and making me fearful of breaking the plastic parts. I tried to "clean" the threads with a metric tap and die but it appeared to be 4mm x .8, which I did not have. In desperation I sprayed some teflon lubricant onto the threads. This worked wonderfully and I was able to connect all parts with the supplied hex-wrench without fear of breakage.This will now allow my wife to see how far I am behind her when we ride! :-)
1	Mirrycle MTB Bicycle Mirror: A great value and looks cool on my bicycle. It comes complete with detailed instructions and the appropriate Allen Wrench. The instructions call for using a knife to cut away the covering at the end of your handle bar. For a much safer installation, use a step-bit and drill.If I were to fault this mirror in any way it would be this: From the photo it appears that the mirror's upright tube is flexible - it is not. Those baffles are just for show.A rear-view mirror is an essential safety tool only following in importance the use of a helmet. I am a teacher and ride my bike over city streets to work every day.
0	Never in my life to find a product so poor in quality????: My last Mirrycle was purchased some 21 years ago and used on the same bike until recently when it broke.The same new one arrives from Amazon, must be made by exceptionally inferior manufacturer, the plastic simply broken into pieces when you tried to assemble the unit. I am now having a pile of broken plastics....
0	Cheap and horrible design: I mounted this mirror on my bike, and THE NEXT DAY I accidentally tipped my bike over on the side that the mirror was mounted on, and the mirror hit the ground. Luckily for me, the mirror is made out of glass and it shattered on impact. I guess this product is too cheap to be made with any type of shock-proof material. Oh well, $15 lost and a lesson learned.
1	Great mirror!: I've had one of these mirrors on my bike for seven years. I liked it so much that I ordered one for my husband's new bike. It's easy to install and a tough little mirror. It's been crunched several times and I'm always able to readjust it just fine.
1	Great Little Mirror!: Bought a couple of these for our bicycles.Had to slightly modify my handlebar grip to install.When installed, the mirror is very secure, can be easily adjusted and maintains its position.I guess it's about the perfect size for a bicycle.I wouldn't ride without this mirror now.Highly recommended.
1	Works with a road bike!: I bought this for my road bike and it fits in the end of the drop bar. I left out the middle piece and it works well. The only potential problem would be in case of a fall, as the mirror is quite rigid when installed. Great image quality, and I have grown quite accustomed to having a mirror in just a few weeks.
1	A must have: And after a mile of riding after mounting this, I wondered how I could have ever lived without rear view mirror on my bike. The only "con" is that it is very difficult to mount (you do need lots of strength to tighten it up), but it's also a plus because one it's on, it stays one (you really don't want the mirror to swivel or move every time you hit a pothole or go over a bump). I've dropped my bike a few time and the mirror did not break.
1	Great Bicycle Mirror: This is a great Bicycle Mirror, and if you ride in traffic an invaluable safety feature.Installation is easy but READ THE INSTRUCTIONS FIRST! The screws have a locking feature so they're VERY hard to turn. Use an appropriately sized screwdriver, installing the assembled unit as the LAST step in the process. Tighten the screws just tight enough so that the unit can be adjusted following installation, but not loose enough that bumps will 're-adjust' its position.
1	Good mirror: This mirror is actually a mirror and not a mirrored surface, which is great. It doesn't minimise or enlarge the reflection, so is a true reflection. It's very clear, even around the edges, and is actually glass and not plastic. Unfortunately, I dropped and broke it before I could use it, so I can't comment on how it functioned.
1	Mirrycycle mryycle: I have owned these mirrors for years. They can be positioned under the left handlebar also, with the mirror pointing toward the stem. You can still see behind you and the mirror won't constantly clang into things and you won't look like some sort of Shriner nerd.
0	Poor Quality -- A Name Brand Signifying Nothing Today: Well, big surprise -- you get what you pay for. I got this set a year or so ago for about $5.00. Can't complain on the price, but the smaller knife was garbage. It had a blade that just flopped limply about between the closed and fully opened (locked) position. And there was also a ding type flaw in the blade. Useless crapper. The big one is OK for a letter or box opener I guess, but no guarantees. I've never used it. Winchester name is not wisely used here -- just another cheap Chinese import.
0	Flip Album:(: This company has a set of business ethics which are questionable. The owner of Flip Books (EBooksystems) plasters their name and links to their website all over your finished work.
0	Disco is Over: I always considered myself the ultimate Donna Summer Fan..butwhen this long awaited Geffen release hit the air waves I knewDisco was over..I have never been so disappointed in an album..even though I remember the first time I heard Hotstuff its hard rock edge I knew things were changing...
1	Donna's not just a Disco Queen: "The Wanderer,"really show's what a fantastic Artist Donna is.She really reaches a new level on this album.I had a Christmas party in the early 80's,and when I put on this record,everyone loved it.If anyone doesn't have this tape,you've got to get it.I believe its Donna Summer's greatest album.Also,years later we saw Donna sitting at a counter in Atlantic City drinking cofee.When people went up to her,she was very friendly.A wonder person off stage as well.
0	Visit Bruce Damer's Website: With all due respect to Mr. Damer, this book is basically an introduction to what Avatars and Virtual Communities are. Mr. Damer provides a guided tour of several online communities. One or more of thewe worlds no longer exist. This is another example of web-time and how difficult it is to publish a book with a technology topic. I found the book very basic. Visit his web site to learn all you need to know and be introduced to the awesome online worlds. . . and save some money.
0	Morbid Ending: If you're expecting Mark Twain's usual funny and cheerful stories, stay away from this one.*Spoiler alert!*The ending is simply sad.
0	HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!: DO NOT GET THIS HORRIBLE BOOK!!! IF YOU WANT A FUN BOOK TO READ, THIS IS THE WRONG ONE!!!! I READ 3 CHAPTERS AND IT IS UNBEARABLE!!!!! IT IS SO SAD AND TERRIBLE!!!!!! DO NOT GET THIS BOOK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!NEVER CONSIDER GETTING THIS BOOK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!CONSIDER THIS REVIEW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0	Not What I Expected: I've purchased loads of stuff from Amazon and have been happy with my purchases. This is my first disappointment. First, I did not receive what is pictured. The tool is "similar" but cheaper looking. Second, the "set" end of the tool is not round (it's kinda oval - poorly ground), nor does it have a concave end as better nail sets do. It tends to skip off nail heads. I'm into multi-tasking tools. So if all I get for my $10 is a mini nail puller - it will sit and rust in my box!For your10 bucks buy sets made by Starrett $10 each - they're perfect.
0	Not as good as Mame: I watched Mame with Lucille Ball and enjoyed it very much. Auntie Mame with Rosalind Russell was such a let down that it has been a struggle to watch the whole film. Perhaps it is because Miss Russell looks like she is acting and Miss Ball IS Mame. Or it could be that there is no music or singing in Auntie Mame, the singing in Mame made it a joy to watch over and over. I doubt that I will watch Auntie Mame a second time.
0	Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz: I just don't get it. I had heard so much about this movie, that I just had to have it. Boy was I disappointed. Not funny. Not entertaining. Just a lot of "dahling" this, and "dahling" that with no substance. Rent it, but don't buy it. I already gave my copy away.
0	Lucille Balls version was much better....: I found the movie Auntie Mame a huge dissapointment.If you enjoyed Auntie Mame I highly suggest that you see MAME which is a musical version of Auntie MAME and Stars Lucille Ball.MAME is one hundred million times better.
1	A bit of Sunshine in a Box: I had an Auntie Mame in my life and before she died recently I gave her a copy of this movie and we watched it together and laughed and reminisced together and just enjoyed the movie and each other's company. Then she was gone. I'll always treasure that day and the memories I made with my Auntie Mame. Don't pass up an opportunity to enjoy true entertainment - and have a few tissues handy too!
1	A CLASSIC!: I always look at this film around Christmas time. It never lets me down for getting me into the holiday mood. One of the greatest comedies ever made. From Agnes Gooche's "How Bleak Was My Puberty", to the ever up-beat Rosalind Russell"s Auntie Mame, the laughs are always there. The fox hunt is a side splitter. I'm sure everyone who is anyone will benefit from seeing this film. Especially around the holidays. ciao yaaah69
1	Great Wireless Headphones !: This set of headphones is just right. Good plastic; headgear that is not overly fussy; responsive buttons with good button feel. Tuning is immediate, and the transmission is good. The ear cushions are great... very soft vinyl.I have a earlier model AR wireless headphone set which I like, but those earlier phones are bulky, made of cheap plastic... with foam earpieces that don't feel that great.These new AR772 phones are easy to carry and wear. The recharging unit works nicely with no fuss. The sound is great.
1	Love this product!: Product great. Had one small problem with the product. But seller turned around and made it right. Very quick. I would buy from this seller anytime!!!!
1	good christmas songs: This is a good cd. It has some traditional christmas music, and a few cute little songs but stays with the reasonable realm. It is typical of Raffi's style and the kids love it.
1	Electric Light Orchestra - Part II - One Night Live in Australia '95: The title of this DVD is misleading, as it is not their complete concert from Sydney Australia.This is the same DVD that has been released as "Access All Areas".It consists of interviews with the bands members, intermixed with concert footage.It is still a very good production and I recommend it to any ELO/ELO part2 fans. I was a little disappointed as it wasn't what I was expecting as I already own a copy of Access All Areas.
1	Excellent: Kneipp's bath oils are the best on the market. This is my particular favorite, but I use several and have for many years. The company produces the highest quality of bath products.
0	Better, cheaper options available: Poorly built and fragile, received this one as a gift and it broke very soon after we got it.We have the Rubbermaid mixing pitcher that we've used for years with no problems. It is cheaper and has a much better designed lid.If you want a mixing pitcher, this is not the one you want.
1	So warm and cozy!!!!: I live in New York and find the winters a little tough for my "little tootsies". I moved here from California and never know my feet could get so cold. However, since I bought these North Face boots my feet have been warm, snug and happy! Even on the coldest, snowiest days, trudging around in wet slush, my feet stay warm! I am in awe! I LOVE these boots!P.S. They run true to size
1	search this out please!: it's so amazingly brilliant/pretty.even my acquaintances who don't like shoegazey stuff likethis. "something goes wrong" is one of the mostappallingly good and simple songs i have ever heard.the stars of this band were the drummer jim goodall(a monster!) and of course braddy the brat (brilliant,knows it). i used to write them off as mbv rips--then i got this...and went back to the equally enticing "shot forth self living""the buried life" title cribbed from a Matthew Arnold poem, by the by. the shot forth from Blake, i think?! i think goodall dreamed that up cause my friend said he reads Joyce and stuff. a drummer-reader? amazing. i loves the meds!!!
0	A young girl experiences world war 2 as a jewish girl: This book was very interesting. The topic at least. Most of the Characters were not described in detail so it was hardly ever sad. Th plot skipped around alot so unless you can understand difficult reading I would not recommend it.
1	Engaging: This book gives you a good look into what the people on our police forces go through every day of their lives. Its enough to make a person wonder why anyone would ever decide to do this job.
1	I can still quote this book years later: This is such a memorable book I can still quote it years after reading it. For example, a cop puts someone in a holding cell. He comes back later and can tell instantly if the person is guilty or not. How does he know? Read the book! Or how does a cop look at the home of an 80-year-old man and know he's a child molester? Then there's the story of the mobster who actually says, "It's so hard to find good help." One cop tells what child molesters say when they're captured, how they sickly view the relationship with the child. There's the capture of a child molester after a kid describes lots of yellow doors and seeing a plane through the ceiling -- this book just captures the attention with lots of quick, compelling stories. Very well done, worth reading!
1	Couldn't put it down...: I thought the stories in this book were good for the length of each one. I have to say that "Captivated by You" was the best of all three. If you like short, steamy, predictable stories you'll like this book!
1	Excellent Book, but full of Errors: This book is a MUST HAVE if you plan on working with XML within Flash. The book covers all the details of working with ActionScript and XML. I started out with little knowledge of ActionScript and working with the ActionScript associated with Flash's XML objects and methods. The authors explain almost every thing so clearly, that you understand not only how to work with the XML objects and methods, but how to work with ActionScript. I've found that there are quite a few errors that cause things not to work, which kind of bugged. But with my new knowledge was able to correct the bugs. .... I gave it 4 stars because it was enjoyable learning, easy to understand and I was able to do what I wanted...Learn XML in Flash, I would have given it a +5 if the errors wouldn't have been there.
0	Does not work with Lifeproof Iphone Case: I just received the dock extender and it does not work with the LifeProof case. Has anyone gotten it to work with the Lifeproof case? It does not seem to be long enough to reach the phone.
0	Great Film, Horrible transfer to DVD: Gold Rush is a one of the best movies ever so unless you really dislike silent movies, it's a must see. Anyway, all my complaining that follows has to do with the this particular transfer to DVD. The DVD is simply awful. Don't get it. The contrast is so messed up that almost everything in the picture is either completely black or completely white. Needless to say, a lot of information is lost. A while ago I have seen a cleaned up version of the film that was excellent so I know that it makes sense to wait for someone to do better job of transfer to DVD.
0	&#65533;I Am Not Amused&#65533;: Watching The Gold Rush, I understand why Chaplin had trouble achieving a breakthrough in Britain. The humour in the film is very unsophisticated, at times even ridiculous. Chaplin has had 4 or 5 ideas for 'funny' situations, and has then tried to link them together to a film. A few of the situations are a bit funny, but the film as a whole is not funny at all.
0	This DVD is pure garbage. I plan to use it as a coaster.: Don't waste your money on this one. The transfer is so bad that it is virtually unwatchable. This movie is a classic and it is just a shame that the producers of this DVD obviously have no respect for it. This is the last time I buy anything from this company.
0	ZZZZZZZZZZZ: Carly couldn't have selected a worse bunch of songs to cover. Oh Suzanna...come on now! Same dull monotone throughout the cd. One redeeming feature it may get your youngsters so bored they will fall asleep quickly at bedtime.
1	Simply Beautiful!: listening to this spare yet very elegant album is a joy indeed! goes to show why we fell in love with Carly in the first place.
1	"Wings Over America" shows the band could really rock: For Christmas1976, Wings released the triple live set of their most triumphant tour. Most of the material is from "Band On The Run", "Venus And Mars", and "Wings At The Speed Of Sound", as well as a few Beatle hits. The band here comes off rocking harder than their studio albums would lead you to believe, and you often can't help but remember what the excitement was all about then. A great show.
1	Definitive In Many Many Ways: This is one of the best live recordings of McCartney I have ever heard, and I say that having collected Beatle-related releases for many years. If you want the definitive version of "Maybe I'm Amazed," this one's for you. If you want to hear what the Beatles circa1975 would have sounded like, check out "Call Me Back," perhaps one of McCartney's finest vocal performances ever. The lovely "Blackbird" puts in an appearance, as does a chilling and memorable performance of "Yesterday." "The Long and Winding Road," with its beautiful, Penny Lane-like interlude and harmonious rejoinder, "don't keep me waiting," is another highlight not to miss. The Wings stuff is pretty good, too, but if you love McCartney, you don't want to miss this one.
1	Shark is right: This saw cuts fast and straight. I cut PT 5x5's flat and straight no problem. Pulling to cut lends to accuracy and ease. Handle sucked, I replaced it with an old wooden handle, now it's perfect.
0	one of Mandys worst movies: This movie was one of Mandy Moores earliest movies. Her acting was good, she looked real good, and she gets turned down, get real directors, not likely to happen in real life. Franka Potente looks too old and too hard for this movie. The story is weak and unrealistic, Elija is ok, but plays the part of a stupid dude. Don't waste your money, unless you just want to see how a bad script is made into a bad movie.
1	Great product, great vendor: I have used guai from Fludan for probably 5 years now for fibromyalgia. They are a great vendor. I used the powder for a while, but switched to the 600 mg capsules. Since the product base is powder, I think it appropriate to comment even though I got tired of stuffing my own capsules. (I do still have the equipment though to create my own capsules.)I order in bulk now and it lasts me probably a year at a time.Pay by check if you can, save the international conversion fees.I highly recommend Fludan's products. I have used a variety of100% guai over the years from different vendors, and rate their product, customer service, and delivery the best.
0	How long will this be "Under Review" ?: I have been waiting to be able to purchase this for weeks now, but the item is "under review". I've contacted Amazon support staff who seemingly made no effort to investigate the issue directly, or suggest a time at which it might become available for purchase again. I'm very disappointed and frustrated by this situation, and the lack of useful customer support. Please attend to this issue as soon as possible.
1	performing betty in the crucible: My name is Marissa and this freshman year of my high school career i am playing betty from the crucible. because of this experience, i have become very familiar with the play. based on the salem witch trials, abigail williams is accused of having been owned by the devil. written in a fascinating way, arthur miller really makes this play an extraordinary doing. i reccomend this book for basically anybody, it is a great type of writing for anyone to read.
1	On the subject of symbolism in 'The Crucible': I enjoyed this play very much. Although historically relevant to the salem witch trials in my opinion this play's meaning had little to do with them. What I see Miller focusing on is more the symbolism of the events transpiring within and their relation to modern events (e.g. The Mcarthy Trials). While portraying what happened in Salem during that era, what Miller is focusing on and what he try's to inform you he is focusing on is how he feels it relates to the times in which he lived. Not as a historical account, but dealing with the act's of propoganda, lie's, and how gullible people are to be drawn into a web of deceit such as portrayed within the play
1	The book showed how stupid and gulable people can be.: The book had a lot of interesting conflicts. It showed how easily people can be decieved. If they want to believe they will believe anything. The people pointing the finger were very quick to judge and very quick to accuse. The book was kind of almost unreal. It was hard to believe. I know that it was based on what really happened, but I think that the events were kind of extreme
0	Missing Lines: This was supposed to be an unabridged version. It is not. Thus, the audio is not helpful when trying to use it while reading the play -- there is nothing like missing whole sections of the play while trying to find where the cast has skipped to next. Also, the way that the characters are interpreted make the Puritans out to be cartoonish. Perhaps, that is the way that some view the Puritans (or other highly religious people), however, when combined with some of Miller's lines (which can at times come across like a bad church play), the characters lack genuineness. As someone with a theater background, I kept on wondering what Abigail's character would be liked if played straight. Anyway, the main thing, be aware that you aren't buying the entire play.
1	Great Sound: worth the money for sure would buy any Onkyo product any time very high quility for the money move over sony you got company
1	EXCELLENT: THIS HAS BEEN GREAT. IT PLAYS WELL AND IS EASY TO OPERATE. I COULD NOT FIND ONE IN TOWN, SO THIS REALLY HELPED.
0	Look elsewhere: The other morning, the unit suddenly came on by itself. No surge -- nothing else was effected, the lights didn't even dim. Came on, but won't function by either the remote or the buttons on the face of the unit. Gone. Should have paid attention to all the poor reviews. A little under a year old. Heck, I've had off brand units last for five years...
0	Very Disappointed: Worked great when first connected to receiver / speakers. Then it just stopped working. Couldn't even remove my CD's that were inside. Amazon refunded my money, (minus shipping and restocking fees). I only had it for 5 months.
0	quality control: save your money folks. this one aint nothing but a paperweight. very poor quality control. only good thing is I'm returning within 30 days so I can get my money refunded.
0	Don't Listen to it more than once.: The first time I put this CD into the Discman, I was feelin it. The album was pretty hot. Than I heard it again. The beats are tight, but Bone sounds like Popeye. They gotta slow down the flow.
1	resurect E.1999: Dear Mr. Ougi, There has never been a group that could flow like Bone. Eazy got it right when he put those guys together. All thuggish Bone fans will love this album. It makes the art of war look like Britaney Spears (with the exeption of "Thug Love"). I am sorry, but I just dont think it compares with E.1999 NOTHING EVER WILL! Thats why I gave it a 4!
0	THEY MIGHT NEVER LIVE UP TO E.1999 ETERNAL: With this new album, I was expecting Bone to go back to the lyrics of E.1999 Eternal(A classic, one of the best rap albums). Unfortunately, like Art of War, the songs that are good can be counted with less than all my fingers. Each album after e.1999 has fallen short of it. This album is alright but too many slow songs, SOMETHING I DON'T WANT TO HEAR FROM BONE. Their gangsta style is what got everyone, and Easy-E, on their new redifining rap flows. After the Crossroads, their songs turned more pop for money. 2 Stars cause there is much better stuff out there right now like Chronic 2001, Alkaholiks, etc.
1	2nd in a terrific family saga series: It's not easy to find this book anymore - I got it at my library but had to special-order it from another branch. The series has two different numbering systems - one by order written, one by order of events. In the order of events, this is the 2nd in events, following The Building of Jalna. I wasn't crazy about the opening, but the story really picked up after that and is a delightful mix of humor and drama. If you like family sagas, then you'll enjoy the Whiteoaks series. I especially enjoyed the children in the story (Ernest's 'my eye' comments really become comical). I plan to read the whole series.
0	The worst creatures in the world.: Yuck! How can they do that, so incredible and disgrace. I've never heard this kind of songs before. And they call it songs? And their looks, oh gosh, some black hair, some blond hair, what are they doing? Their look is soooooooooo disgusting. And make me want to vomit too. How can u guys have such bad taste? Really make me wonder, they must be God's mistake. PITY.
1	Magnetic to children: This is the first time I have purchased Raffi in CD format. I have bought many tape copies over the years as gifts for many children. I have travelled by car all over the North American continent with my own children and this music made the trips fun. It was the only music we still played after a trip! I feel like the music helps them put feelings and thoughts into contexts that they can understand. It also entertains the adults. After once through the songs, you will be humming along, after three times through you will be making up verses. Highly Recommended!
1	Great Head Unit: Pioneer makes some great auto head units and this is no exception, The unit works and functions flawlessly and looks great. Very simple to operate and there is not a clutter of buttons to add confusion. The USB port is a very handy thing to have but I found that it did not function well when playing music from a jump drive, I think because of the different formats, it locked up and stopped playing. My Ipod worked without any problems at all and was easy to control from the unit. I really think Pioneer makes the Best auto stereo for the money.
1	Excellent: This was the best and perhaps the most slow books of the series but I absolutely loved it? Who IS Taran?
1	An excellent and heartfelt story, though not my favorite: This is probably my least favorite of the Prydain Chronicles. Don't get me wrong though, I liked it, just not as much as the others. I thought it moved slower than the others, and also Eilonwy was left out of the book, and she was always the highlight for me. Anyway, the basic plot of the book was that Taran at last cannot stand not knowing who his parants were, so he goes on a personal quest to try discover his identity. He hopes to find out he is from noble birth because then he can marry Eilonwy, but what he finds isn't exactly what he thought... So, in general this was a great book that asks the ultimate moral question and deals with the truth that it isn't who your parants are the make you you. This is an excellent series that I would recommend to anyone, though it would make more sense if you had read the previous four first.
1	A Children's Classic: Blessedly devoid of adult humor and sexual inuendo, Sleeping Beauty pits good against evil, and good wins. Intricate background scenery, silly fairies, and wonderful singing highlight this classic fairy tale. Is it a realistic picture of life as a medieval princess? Of course not. It's not supposed to be.
1	AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!: Thank you for replacing the movie that you sent me with a brand new MILLION time better copy of it! was a great package to come home to! it made my daughters day
1	Disney's Sleeping Beauty on Blu-Ray: History repeats itself! "Sleeping Beauty" was the first animated Disney film to be released on VHS tape (*many* moons ago), so it makes perfect sense that it would be their first animated film to be released on Blu-Ray. I can hardly wait! I have always loved the distinctive artwork (kudos to the late-great Eyvind Earle) and the villianess that is Maleficent (voiced by the same actress as the Evil Stepmother in "Cinderella"). And knowing that it was originally made in wide screen format, it will certainly be a feast for the eyes on Blu-Ray!
1	Sleeping Beauty: What a wonderful movie. Reminded me of watching when I was a kid and so happy to have found it again for my kids.
0	Okay Film - Poor Extras: This was sneaked out onto release on region 2 disc ages ago in England (minus commentary). Although the film is visually stunning and has some nice set pieces it lacks warmth and, with some small exceptions, has no compelling characters. The extras are as dry as sticks and smack of the pompous. If you want a special edition Disney disc stick to 'The Lion King' or 'Beauty and the Beast'.
0	Beware! Digital flaw: Everything about this release is wonderful except that it has a manufacture digital flaw. Both our original and replacement had the exact same digital flaw, in the exact same location. Too bad that this dvd was released without getting the bugs out first.
1	the most amazing masterpiece of animation ......ever/: i can only say ,that this movie meant so much to me as a child ,growing up in ROME ,my mother used to draw me the characters from the movie ,while playing the beautiful music ,at the piano,this movie got me interested in drawing and painting,,if this movie is ever made into a regular feature film ,the actress to play MALEFICENT hAs got to be ,the singer SIOUXSIE SIOUX,she has the voice ,and the sinister ,and yet powerful allure ,to keep the movie going...thanks disney ,for creating a wonderful MOVIE for generations to enjoy....machi
1	Sleeping: I love this movie. It's one of my favorite earlier Disney films. I love all of the colors and the music. I personally think that this is one of Disney's better Fairy Tale adaptation. The movie just really flowed well with every thing.
1	sleeping beauty: It was so easy to order and the product came earlier that I thought. My greatgrandaughter was so delighted it was in excellent shape and the process was effertless. I have since order other products from Amazom. thank you for excellect service.
1	Wonderful Film. Excellent Extras.: ALL of the short film Extras are on the Second Disk. If you want any Extras, be very careful to order the TWO Disk Set.Here are some of The EXTRAS on Disk TWO..."Disneyland" (1954), Once Upon a Dream: The Making of Walt Disney's 'Sleeping Beauty' (1997) (V), Grand Canyon (1958), 4 Artists Paint1 Tree: A Walt Disney 'Adventure in Art' (1958)
0	Disappointed...: I was more than thrilled to pay the $70 dollars to own this timeless classic, as it is one of my faves.The reason why I didn't rate my purchase 5 stars are for a few reasons. First it arrived a day later than what I was was predicted. I didn't think too much of it, however, the problem was it arrived with scuffs and scratches on the plastic housing the cover art. The case had a crack on the upper corner of the blu ray case. I was under the impression that I would be receiving something that looks new as it was deemed on the packaging. It was also just the blu ray case with the dvd sleeve taped over the case. Was it not supposed to be in some sort of box-set? Overall, I love this movie but I'm extremely disappointed at the condition the film arrived in. I feel as though I paid more money for something that may not have been as much as I spent. Oh well...
1	Excellent Buy!: Made my first batch this morning. I added bananas and pecans. Excellent! I highly recommend this mix if you are in the market for a gluten free muffin mix.
1	Gluten free mix: Kids and I love this. Texture is great. We use it to make scones and kids ask for it all the time.
1	I'm no R&B fan, but you gotta hear this!!: I'm a major Talking Heads fan and some years ago I heard these guys do the final track featuring 'Once in a Lifetime' and had to get it. To my pleasant surprise I really enjoyed most of the CD. The vocals are so smooth you too will take notice! A sample of the intro of tracks won't do the CD justice as many need to build a bit. It also wouldn't hurt to be somewhat spritual as many songs reference the faith, but don't let the 'Christian R&B' thing bug you. This is just good music.
0	Deceptively surprising: The many good customer reviews encouraged me to buy this book, with one eye pointing at women stories and one pointing at knowledge of other cultures and different realities. Although the book is well written and the story engaging, its placement in the desert seems arbitrary and not faithfull to geographical and gender reality = I did not learn anything new about the desert and Islam, nor about women. It was a nice, easy to consume fuilleton.
1	agama tantra : my hands and yours: This is the most helpful tool I have encounterd for use in prayer.The illustrations are very exact and obviously extremely well studied. Kleen's texts are invaluable to the western practitioner of agama hindu bali(Agama Tirtha).
0	Just Dang Perplexing: I have a deep and abiding respect for blacks, black culture, and the need to continue the important struggle for equal rights. The great civil rights icons are my heart-felt heros.This is why it makes me wonder drop-jawed, when I see so much of black America (it seems) embrace some clever gang member, who can couch his utter nonsense in some cute rhymes, dip & bop on stage, and then get glamorized and idolized. I see no value in his work because there is no value.It makes blacks look dumb, and they are NOT dumb.
1	Donald Goines-Excellent Writer: I read this book when I was13 years old. I was so impressed with this book that I read his entire collection of writings.I am now an adult and have encouraged my teenage children to read them as well.All of his writings are highly recommended. It will make you cry and laugh and I guarantee that you will not be able to put them down.
1	Hubba hubba hot stuff: So Mars needs men to repopulate? If they all look like this babe, sign me up! She's tall, sexy, and cold as ice. This may be the first and only sci-fi movie centralized around a female alien dominetrex. Talk about hot. She could melt the polar ice caps just walking by.Her robot companion is nothing much more than a huge walking box. Maybe the movie went broke after the dazzling special effects they used inside the space ship.The movie is pretty entertaining and creepy in a strange way. It's not my favorite Atomic Age movie, but if you enjoy 50's Sci-Fi, you need this in your collection.
0	Devil Girl * a very Bad copy: This isn't really a review of the movie but rather a review of the video sent out. My copy was so bad (just simply too dark) I could not see any the player in the scene. I would guess it just over copied, as besides dark hard edges in the movie (like walls of a building) were wavy. I returned the DVD and got a full refund. I will continue looking for a better copy.
1	Nearly perfect example of the genre!!: That is, cheesy '50s sci-fi flicks featuring women in skimpy outfits. This has pretty much everything the disbelieving guy, the sexy alien who underestimates us earth folk, the other girl that also falls for the disbelieving guy; the older couple, and the kindly boss. Everythng, that is, except a logical plot, and who needs that? Buy this right now!!
1	A high quality album for lovers of good soul music: 'Sleep Talk' and 'My love is so raw' are the stand out dance tracks for the more energetic among you, while the lovers would like 'Just Call My Name ' and 'I Need Your Lovin' for chilling out to.
0	take it from me: this suction cup did not work at all i was very disappointeda waste of money on the dent i was using it for i put the suction cup on it and started pulling but the dent didnt go any where you could tell that it was tryna work but it didnt
0	A time to kill: This is not a full sized book. It was a little more worn than what was noted. I did received it before the arrival date and I would order from this company again, but I will make sure the book is a regular sized book and not a book club sized book.
0	Came Bent: I was excited to get this to put on the wall in my playroom for magnets for the kids. But the item came bent so i had to send it back. I know that what I wanted to use it for was not the intended use for this item, but I imagine it would need to not be bent for most usage.
0	sorry.......: i have to say that i am sorry for letting this go on this long...you see, i bought this set through amazon based on it's 5 star rating about a year ago and i feel that it is my duty as a person with good taste in dance and trance music to say that it SUCKS! don't make the mistake i made. i'm talking boring mixing, decent tracks. i don't think that there is one moment on these two cd's that there are actually two tracks playing at the same time. of course, i haven't listened to it in several months now... actually, i think i gave it away.
1	longer version: this book is packed with info.. it's the longer version of "a brief history" and how your prof. has so much info..that's not showing up in your shorter text (if you're getting the brief version) it has a lot of pics..and maps..and is easy to read.. very informative ..text book
1	FIRST MP3: The screen is very nice and easy to view, even in bright sunlight. I was able to load songs with no trouble, and sound quality is pretty good. Only negative is that you must use a USB hookup to charge it.
1	Its what I wanted!: I am very pleased, compatible with windows vista, (was worried) and as far as battery usage, I walk on my treadmill for 40 mins and I usually don't have a bar missing from the battery for atleast 3 uses, not to mention the battery has 3 bars. Very lightweight and user friendly. Will buy another for my boyfriend.
0	Where Eagles Dare: Did not like this movie. It might have some juvenile appeal but certainly not for someone in touch with reality. lol,lol,lol!
1	Broadsword calling Danny Boy...: Clint and Richard in the perfect movie to watch on xmas day! Great script, excellent dialog and some very nice set pieces.When is this thing coming out on DVD!
1	A great movie about how the Americans outfoxed the Germans: The movie was well made and how the Americans thought that they had captured the right person, instead they were mistaken.
0	Monotone: Great movie, unfortunatly it only plays in monotone not stereo Dolby like it says on the case. I played it on 3 different DVD players with the same result. Rather distracting.
0	Messy Air: It starts off pretty well, then decides it doesn't want to be a Mash type of film but wants to be a big buddy buddy action flick. Yet it's not that either.It winds up being a mess of uninspired satire, that has Mel Gibson spouting off a series of trying too hard to be funny one liners .The story is about the CIA's secret drug smuggling for cooperation and arms in Southeast Asia during the Vietnam war. It can never decide if it's just a glib buddy buddy action film or satire with an edge and winds up being a crass over-produced failure. Robert Downey Jr. is enjoyable for a while but no one is given anything resembling a real character to play. And the parade of stereotypical characters, ethnic insults and missed opportunities becomes numbing after a while.Chris Jarmick, Author of The Glass Cocoon with Serena F. Holder Available End of January 2001....
1	Expensive: A valuable book in this field. Better and fuller text than most Quimper books. Along with the average color photos, there is a broad and useful appendix of many small b&w photos. A good addition to any faience library, but -- it is too expensive, even through Amazon.com! Publisher, get real!
0	Inexpensive but be careful: The previous reviews are all correct. Inexpensive, silent and easy to load watches. However, I have had this unit overwind two watches. These are $200 Japan automatic movements so I wasn't very happy. Might be better on a swiss movement, but why would you want to risk a more expensive watch on this winder.
1	For once a product worth more than cost: I have seen fancier watch winders made from elegant wood and perhaps of finer craftsmanship which are offered at costs for a double winder (which this is) starting at multiples of the cost of this product. I have had the item for two weeks and it is a fantastic value. It offers settings to wind both clockwise and counter-clockwise and an on/off switch which I shut off at night.It also winds for one hour and rests for three. A whole lot of features and great bang for the buck!! I keep it in an unobtrusive place and it is surprsingly quiet. The vendor (AA Store) provided outstanding service and I am hard-pressed to imagine any buyer of this winder not being delighted with it. Even the finest timepiece (I only own a watch) would not object to a home in this winder...perhaps not elegant, but certainly functional and cost-efficient.
0	Very loud!: I bought this winder for my husband because of the price. But it is so loud!!!! We had to put it another room because it was way too noisy for the bedroom. I wouldn't recommend this. I guess sometimes you get what you pay for.
0	I would not buy it again: At first, I thought this was a pretty good deal. I figured I could tolerate the somewhat cheap, plastic appearance because of the favorable price. However, the winder lasted only six months before dying. At a rate of two per year, the price starts to look a lot less favorable!
1	The hit of Xmas - why did I wait so long?: Since a kid I've wanted one of these - put them in my grandchildren's stockings - what a hit! What a cool call! Simple but effective - I will now finally order one for myself!
1	Feeling Mellow: This is a great CD when you're feeling mellow or slightly sad. Nonetheless, the lyrics still have bite, which keeps it one step above the rest. It doesn't push, but is very subtle and understated. For this reason it lives on as a classic, after all the other fads of music have passed on by. You have to hear it.
0	Urgh! Ruined by an Americanisation!: This book is beautifully illustrated, however it is RUINED by the fact that the wombat at the end calls his Mum "Mom" (it would get 5 stars otherwise, the Wombat is my favourite "native"). If you're going to write a book on an Australian native mammal, at least give it a sense of authenticity and an Australian "accent". I picked it up at a local bookshop and almost flung it out of my hands when I saw that.
0	HELL NO NOBODY TAKES THE NAME FROM 2PAC: nobody takes the light out of tupac and sais all eyes on us....First of all, 50cent is a wannabe, he has no skill, no lyrics he just tries to act tough and his music is boring and he throws on heavy beats and tries to beef with everyone to get credibility but he is overrated because the rap world is so weak today. DONT BUY THIS instead get something real before these guys rapped about money cash hoes
0	WTMI: I found The Devils Highway nearly impossible to slog through. Not to make light of the level of human suffering the author was attempting to expose but I found it repetitive and exasperating. The author felt it necessary to wallow in the details and belabor the point by taking each individual involved and describe their role in the account or suffering separately and in meticulous detail. I wanted to shout at the author “I got it already” now get on with the story or as my daughter is fond of saying “WTMI” (Way too much information)
1	Outstanding: I reside in Texas and have personal knowledge of the immigration situation from a different view than that reflected in the book. It very much humanizes this situation and makes one aware that these are real people with families and a history.
1	A third novel that surpasses its predecessors.: Hugh Holton is a Chicago police officer who uses a vivid imaginationand a good sense of story telling to weave some prettydifferent mysteries set in a realistic Chicago background.While it is generally helpful to have read Presumed Dead andWindy City, it is not a requirement.One of the most intriguing characters on the side of law and order isthe Master of Deception and Disguise. Read the book and seewhat I mean.Larry Cole is truly at his best in this book. I look forwardto reading Hugh's next.
1	I have really entered the dru.: Since the day my girlfriend introduced this group to me, my heart has never been the same. It has "given me one more reason" to love her the more. Sisquo is really talented. Woody has real soul. Nokio is the man and Jazz be fine. I can hardly wait for a new release from these guys. Let's hear it for dru hill. Drufans show them more love. Psst whatever happened to their official website?
1	Don't Sleep On This Album, I'm telling YOU!: I wish I would've taken my own advice earlier, cuz that's exactly what I did at first. And I regret ever doing that! I used to listen to only 2 songs "These Are the Times" & "The Love we had" But, NOW the whole CD is GOOD! So, for those few bad reviews that were written. I know how you may listen to a CD and it might not catch your interest at first, but you have to atleast listen to a CD 3 to 4 times to really feel it. This CD has some really funky soulful songs like #2,#3, #6, #7 and some really romantic ballads! My favs are "I'll be the One" & "Everything" DRU HILL I really wish y'all the best, because this CD is the BOMB!
1	THiS iS mY FaVoRiTe CD Of aLL TiMe!!: Dru Hill definetly did it again.. These 4 men are ASTOUNDING! I love them! They are so amazingly talented!! I've had this CD since it came out in '98 and it hasn't moved from my CD player! This album is AWESOME! Anyone who hasn't bought it, you are missing out on the best CD ever.. I'm not exaggerating at all. All of my friends seem to agree also because everyone who has it (which is just about everyone!) simply adores it just like i do! So y'all gotta go out and buy it if you haven't already!!
1	It was off tha hizzie shizzie: This cd was really good. It was just amazing! And of course they are too. All of them! Anyone who does not have this cd needs to go out and get it. I am glad that I bought it.
1	lightweight and it works: If you are looking for a lightweight trimmer this is the one. It is a good length and it is one of the handiest garden tools I have. Highly recommend.
1	Best I've Found So Far: My four year old son will sit and watch this even though he insists he does not want to learn Chinese and prefers to watch cartoons. It moves pretty slowly, but it does have entertaining features, such as real animal photos, funny masks, and video of kids playing on the beach. The speakers are not native, but they seem to be taking care to speak clearly and use correct inflections. There is a decent amount of repetition. Even though my son refuses to repeat any of the words, I think it is training his ear to pick up Chinese more easily later. I find the pin ying subtitles helpful and wish they were provided throughout, instead of just the first time each word is introduced and during the recap at the end.
1	a six star album: Weezy, congrats!! The uncrowned king of the rap game, seriously !!! Dawg , I wasn't a fan of the breakup, I still don't agree, but time changes ,so do people. You were the bigger person to make a record about your feelings about your dawgs, instead of riding on the other Hot Boys, you kept it trill. Mannie you cut the buck on this beesh. Hot as fizzuck, the best Cash Money album of all time. A sure Grammy !! Weezy if you top this you one, I am going to campaign to call it Wayne's World . Man, I aint riding your sack, but dawg you are just flawless my n*gga . Jada got a pretty good album, but yours will be the album of the summer ,fall and so on. Maybe you can do a collabo with Dirty out Montgomery !!! Mannie did and it was scorchin' ! Well done whoadie !!!
0	Best rapper alive? HAHAHAHAHAHA: Yea dont make me laugh, best rapper alive?? Yea f*cking right! First of all cash money is THE stupidest name for a rap group ever, even though it does accurately describe the greed and ignorance it spreads like a wildfire through its music. Though i hav to admit Lil Wayne IS the best rapper in cash money (which really doesnt say anything at all when u look at the competition). His lyrics are all about the 4 big things in commercial rap these days, (money, cars, women and jewlery). Man if Tupac, Big L and Biggie were still alive there wouldnt be clowns like this around. If you want to know the REAL best hip hop albums of '04 pick up Madvillainy, 4th Dimensional Rocketship Going Up, Viktor Vaughn 2 and Murs 3:16.(Oh yea, and please click the "not helpful" button so i have an accurate count of the number of mainstream loving retards that read this, thanks).
1	I love Lil Wayne: I think Lil Wayne is one of the best rappers alive.I haven't been a big fan of Lil Wayne until I heard him with Young Money now I love everything about him.All of his albums are the bomb including this one.Anyone who doesn't love his flow and his style is a hater.Lil Wayne keep doin it big don't let these haters slow u down.
1	Lil Wayne beats all of his other albums: Think about it...if birman and mannie fresh put alot of work in this album it's got to be great. The problem is it's not an album that you can listen to over and over again.
0	Lil Wayne is a Lil Wack!: this guy is a pathetic excuse for a rapper, i dislike lil wayne alot and he cant rap and he is no good n his face is really just there for u 2 knock him out. this guy sux and i cant believe he is famous and selling records, its embarrassing and i hate him very much, his album would be just as bad as himself.----------- DO NOT SUPPORT LIL WAYNE ---------------
1	Didn't expect to find this classic: This game is a diamond. Fun, challenging, exciting, and enjoyable to :) This is a DOS game from the pre Windows 95 era, but with hi resolution and 256 color support I believe it still holds it's ground today.
0	Looks Tough: Looks are deceiving. I haven't taken this item out on any serious adventure yet but out of the box it feels rather flimsy. The light in the back that swivels is tough to maneuver and I think it will probably break off sometime. The front light is kind of dim. The radio and flasher are OK. Everything works as supposed to, I just wish I shopped around before I picked this one up.
1	A worthwhile investment!: I have to disagree with the prior review of this album. Yes, its late period Wynton not long before he died, BUT, the album contains some spirited swinging trio music that certainly agrees with my ears! Tunes like Scufflin' and Dontcha hear me callin to ya are are simple but infectious grooves equal to any of Wynton's earlier trio efforts. I will admit that Walk on By isnt exactly all that inspiring, but on the whole this is a decent performance from a cohesive group of star performers. Its not the greatest jazz trio disc around, but its sits nicely in my collection as one of only a handful of readily available CD's that Wynton made under his own name.
1	A Great Season - A Limited DVD: SciFi 's (hereafter 'Skiffy') quixotic post-cancellation rerun schedule has forced die-hard "Farscape" fans to invest in sets of DVDs. Unfortunately, the kind of static, text-only "extras" ADV includes do little justice to the series. Rumor has it that the fans have been heard and Season Three's set has significantly improved.Having said that, the move by Skiffy executives to scuttle the show after Season Four's cliffhanger is made more incomprehensible with each viewing of the previous seasons. Even the minor episodes contain multi-faceted character development - most startling in Henson Creature Shop's Rygel - and layered writing. In spite of the flaws in ADV's presentation, this set is well worth owning - and certainly provides a more convenient viewing atmosphere than the present midnight rerun madness.
0	Yawner: The DVD is great in quality for picture and sound. The CD does not have near as good quality. There are no suprises here and a live cd should not be made by Coldplay...why? because the songs are the exact same as they are on the album. All of their songs follow the same structure, same chord progression, same repetative beat. Yellow is to Politik as The Scientist is to Amsterdam. The worst song on the album would have to be In My Place, where he clearly doesn't want to sing the chorus because he probably is scared of going flat and allows the crowd to do it for him. The song is not as powerful as it is on the album. Just buy a Rush of Blood to the Head and you'll be more satisfied. A reviewer referenced Oasis copying the Beatles...well Coldplay copies U2.
0	You have got to be kidding me!: I loved Coldplay's other two albums, but I have never heard such crap! I am ashamed to say that it is not worth the money. He sings out of tune and can't harmonize for crap! Five stars come on people...rate the CD not the Band!
0	DVD Problem: The rate would be a good 4,5... but the DVD doesn't play in Europe... So don't buy it if not American... otherwise music is neat, enjoy it, America.Marko Smolej, Slovenia
1	EXCELENT DVD, BUT SOME OF THEIR BEST SONGS WERE FORGOTTEN: First I want to say that when I say "some of their best songs" I'm refering to some of my favorite coldplay songs like "Green Eyes", "Warning Sign", "Brothers and sisters", "Easy to please", "Spies" and "We never change". But don't worry all Coldplay hits are in here like "Clocks", "Yellow", "The scientist", "in my place",etc.The performance of Coldplay on stage is totally awesome and the documentary is interesting. This DVD is very close to be PERFECT but the fact that some of my favorite coldplay songs are missing makes me stay waiting for another coldplay DVD.Check out the new songs theyre really goodIf you like Parachutes and a Rush of blood to the head go buy itAlso listen to some travis wich is with coldplay my two favorite British bands.
1	1 of Da BEST Hip Hop Albumz Eva!!!: This album is1 of the best Hip Hop albums ive listened to in awhile, its really cool & catchy.

1	EXCELLENT: These boys are having their best year ever! After putting out Necroshine(5 stars, best metal album of the year,1999) earlier this year, the band releases a12 pack of cover tunes. With my faith restored in this band after Necroshine, Overkill rip n' tear into all these songs. Personal favorites being Purple's Space Truckin', Motorhead's Overkill, Kiss' Deuce, Manowar's Death Tone, and the Ramones I'm Against It. But all the songs are good, and this band is ready and headed for a re-birth to the top of the metal scene.
1	Incredible healthy, great tasting meals: I own both the High Fit - Low Fat cookbooks (regular and vegetarian). The books are good for both novice and experienced chefs. Using these cookbooks, I have learned how to eat incredibly healthy while serving really tasty meals! The Eggplant Parmesan recipe is now a requirement for potlucks I attend. I love it because it is so easy to make. The cookbooks make great gifts too, I bought10 as gifts for family members. Although I own many cookbooks, I do the majority of my cooking from the High Fit - Low Fat recipes.
1	Combat lighting: This light was highly rated here and on Youtube! I use it on my Mossberg12 ga thunder ranch shotgun. It's very light in weight and great in a home defense situation.
1	Excellent flashlight. I strapped one to mod 22 glock 22 handgun, and the other is on my ar-14, yankee hill carbine rifle.: This flashlight is very good.Beam brightness and focus is great. Also, the flip switch works great for rifle or handgun.
0	Out-of-print for a reason!: The premise of this book, written by an ad agency exec, is that corporate clients are clueless morons who just don't realize what geniuses their ad agency guys are. Marconi's answer to "Getting The Best From Your Ad Agency"? Throw a lot of money their way, question nothing, and worship the results. The book is poorly edited with numerous typos, sequencing errors, etc. It also contains outrageous amounts of filler material - a 3 and1/2 page list of celebrity endorsers and their products, 7 pages of ad slogans going back decades - as well as self-serving examples of "successful" vs. "unsuccessful" ad campaigns (hmm, let me guess whose Chicago based ad agency produced the much lauded campaign for the Chicago Board of Trade.) Waste no time, effort or money tracking this one down.
1	Building with Nature--Review: This is a very important reexamination of the American origins of the Arts and Crafts Movement and the major contibutions of a small group of Bay Area designers. The central role is occupied by the Reverend Joseph Worcester who created one of the true landmarks of the movement with the Church of the New Jerusalem in San Francisco. The author provides new context and a great amount of new reseach. This book is a major accomplishment.
0	Am police and religons expert: it is inaccurate.: Having served as expert witness in comparative religions, and in pyschology, as associate professor at a state college, and as police officer, my opinion of this book is it is not worth reading twice. It is highly inaccurate and biased. It overlooks the proven cases of criminal satanic practice, such as Matamoros Mex, (Palo Maiombre). It agrues from silence. It is just an attempt to make a buck by telling people what they want to hear, religios crimes do not exist, or at least are not a serious threat. Too bad he does not know what he is talking aboiut
1	Steve Perry is AMAZING!: LOVVVVVEEE this cd. Steve Perry is outstanding. His vocal range is truly one of a kind and cannot be duplicated. Great music!!!!!
1	Love ol Jerry Lee: Being in my teens in the 50's , I loved Jerry Lee and Elvis but as I have gotten older I like the slower songs and this CD suits me just fine. I have a lot of 8 track of Jerry Lee and then I bought cassettes and now I'm buying his CD's. I was fortunate enought to see him in person twice and he was great both times.He's a talent and a showman.
0	Tedious!: Maxwell's writing is enjoyable but the restraint of his characters makes the story very slow-moving and boring. Reading this book was a chore
1	Ultra-heavy techno-metal with evil fury: I love this cd. I found out about this little known band thru an industrial website link...I'm glad I kept track with the band and got this cd. The best songs are Cannibal:Burn, Newthead, Scream Johnny Scream, and Twisting and Turning...highly processed vocals but they sound good and evil with buzzsaw guitars and keyboards everywhere. Buy this cd if you like industrial...heavy! This band toured with the likes of16 volt, Acumen Nation, Clay People, Chemlab...stuff like that. good cd...band broke up. might as well buy their one perfect good cd.
1	A Good Collection Of Cindy Morgan's Music: I remember a couple of my favorite Cindy Morgan songs that did not make this collection: "Love Will Break Your Fall" and "Reason To Live". Are there any songs out of these14 that should be taken off to make room for one of these two? Not really. That means this is a good collection.Besides the two I mentioned, this collection also has these other personal favorites: "Sweet Days Of Grace", "How Can I Ask For More", "Real Life", "Listen", "Let It Be Love", and "I Will Be Free".
1	Her Best is as Good as Anybody Else!!: While from album to album, Cindy Morgan's songs can be inconsistent (especially on her first two CDs), when she hit her stride with LISTEN and UNDER THE WATERFALL, in particular, and THE LOVING KIND (which got majorly overlooked), she is as good as anybody else out there. This is truly an exceptional collection. When Cindy Morgan is good, she is really, really good: "Sweet Days of Grace," "How Could I Ask for More," "I Will Be Free" (for my Grammie W. . .), "Listen," "I'll Stand," "Praise the King" & "Take My Life," for starters. The two new tracks are great, too--I love her take on "Love is the Answer." Her best is as good as anybody out there in Contemporary Christian music, and this is a superb collection of those top shelf songs. Not sure I would have added much or left off much. No fluff, no filler--just her best!
0	A bitter disappointment: This Mellencamp album stunk even more badly than Whenever We Wanted. Like another reviewer here said, the only worthwhile songs on this album are "Key West Intermezzo" and "Just Another Day," and even they are nothing compared to JM's other work.If you are not that familiar with Mellencamp, do yourself a favor and get an album like Big Daddy or The Lonesome Jubilee to see what greatness he's capable of. I wasted my money on this sorry collection of third-rate material.
1	10 Stars: On the edge of your seat excitement, great acting, great plot, wonderful ending. Just loved it. Mos Def is an astonishingly great actor. Don't know a thing about his rap music, but have seen him in several films, including "Something the Lord Made", and give him two thumbs up for being able to act like a pro.This is a true thriller - bad cops, bad cop turned good, petty criminal who wants to change, car chases, crowded NY streets, and everything in between.Give it a try and ignore the critics.
1	great movie: This is a great movie to watch. If you like happy endings, don't watch the alternate ending, it sucks....(just didn't like how it ended) I like happy endings
1	Good story line: Starts a little slow, but I'm glad I kept watching. It was a different story line and for once Bruce Willis isn't wearing a 'white hat', more of a gray hat. He's not the good guy, but ends up doing the right thing. Good story line with complicated twists in the plot.Chrissy K. McVay - Author
0	Terrible movie a waste of 2 hours: If your into an endless chase movie without any real plot or substance than this movie is for you. The movie runs forever without any fluidity to the storyline. Bruce willies, an over the hill detective, is forced to chose whether his going to line up with his old squad and eliminate a witness that is about to bring a lot of "good guys " from Willis's old squad or whether he is going to do the right thing and bring the witness to court so he can testify against the corrupted cops. Well the choice is obvious and from there the never-ending chase begins. Overall just a terrible movie. Don't waste 2 hours of your life on this one. Edan Aharony.
0	Be prepared for a warped movie: The back of the DVD case called the movie a "wickedly funny" tale. Not true at all. It is one of those very warped movies, true or not, that makes you feel sick to your stomach. I tend to like the more unusual, moving films, but this is over the line. Reminds me of the Squid and the Whale. I feel very sorry for the author if this truly is based on his life.
0	Great cast, but missing the dark humor of the book: I had high expectations for this movie - I had read the book and knew that the cast had great potential. The actors were great in portraying their roles - from Annette Bening as the eccentric mother to Gwenyth Paltrow as the obedient daughter, but the plot of the movie missed the biting dark humor that had put the novel in the top10 of my collection. I'm afraid that, if I had seen the movie before reading the book, I might not have read the book.
1	True Story, Huh?: Running With ScissorsWhat a movie based on a autobiographical account of the movies main character Augustin. His life is to say the least dysfunctional. He makes it through the with the help of a crazy yet meaningful family of loons that are actually quite lovable. To suffice, the movie is a must see because the acting is outstanding with a great ensemble cast including Annette Benning, Alec Baldwin, Gwyneth Paltrow and the lead whose name escapes me right now. This movie is a must see!!
0	Not a comedy, just strange: If you want to watch a depressing movie about a crazy family then this is the movie for you. Yes, anyone who can survive this is truly remarkable but was marketed wrong as a comedy. I found nothing funny about it. The acting was good, but not what I expected.
0	Running With Scissors: Polarizing performance by Annette Benning. Great cast that followed the story-line as true to the acclaimed novel as possible. An abstract story, entertaining in nature but drags its feet.
0	What A Mess!: Like others, I decided to see "Running With Scissors" based on a trailer I saw that presented it as a dark, eccentric comedy. The cast looked more than promising, and I love quirky movies, but I shut this one off after watching an hour of venom-filled yelling and swearing. It's very unusual for me to not watch a film in its entirety, but I felt I was completely wasting my time and turned it off. I didn't like any of the characters, although I felt some degree of sympathy for the boy (not enough to see how he fared, however). This was the most disappointing film I've seen in a very long time.
0	Sorry: While this review won't be very detailed, I think the point will be quite clear:read the book, skip the movie.
1	Amazing: This game is amazing. It takes an incredible amount of strategy and skill. There are always decisions to be made. Buy it, you will love it.
1	Excellent for the price!: This an excellent comforter for the price! The down pockets are evenly spaced and plumply filled but the down still moves around a bit between squares and it takes a lot of time to wiggle the down back into the center of the comforter. The feather pillows that came free with this in November took nearly 3 months to arrive. The cover is soft and the comforter is very comfortable.
0	BEWARE Cut Version!: I sold this DVD version of Wayne's Alamo on Ebay after I watched the CUT documentary. And where was the documentary cut at? All the interviews with the Mexican actors, or participants of the film were deleted from it!!!! When I watched it a few years ago, I noticed something wrong with it, and I soon realized the parts where the Mexicans were interviewed were cut out of the documentary! A trip, indeed. This is a piece of crappola, and MGM s/be ashamed of itself....but, knowing its past history, I know it isn't ashamed of itself in this racist cut of a documentary! It just wasn't the same without those Mexican participants somehow! It was lacking spirit because of their slanted cut of those Mexican participants in the film, shame on you MGM!!!
1	great movie: The Duke's Alamo is a fine film. So is Walt Disney's Davy Crockett and the 2004 Alamo with Billy Bob Thorton as a fine Davy Crockett. You can't beat all of these for excellent historical adventures.
0	The Alamo with John Wayne: Having seen the wide-screen version, this video was very disappointing. I expected the same movie. I couldn't even sit through the first hour because they kept on cutting out parts that I remember from the full-length wide-screen version. Very disappointing considering you can't return videos that are viewed.
0	To Commit Treason...: If I may commit treason in the eyes of all John Wayne fans--this was NOT the movie for him! Most of his roles (most notably "True Grit") he just fits into, as though they were written with him in mind (and most probably were). This one just doesn't work for him. John Wayne is NOT Davy Crockett; he just says the lines and valiantly dies when the script says the time is right.
1	Great Film!: The Alamo is a masterpiece from John Wayne. Any controversy over this film is overblown and outdated. Who really paid for the keg of Corn Liquor that got blown up by the cannonball, Chill Wills or Davy Crockett? Did Davy sleep with the senora?
0	Honor, courage, duty, hokum: Now that the cold war is over, America should take a cold shower and re-examine this fascinating (if overblown) episode in its history and once more dare to interpret it (perhaps even objectively) for the silver screen. John Wayne's embarassing rendering ages badly - unless, of course, you are a John Wayne fan. Wayne is less interested in history than in a make-believe story of what he thinks history is. As a proud liberal and American I will state it loud and clear: This movie is junk.
0	Not the Director's Version: I want to warn others not to make the mistake I did. This is not that beautiful director's cut which was issued on Laser and VHS. If that is what you are looking for, WAIT.I am completely in awe why the studio would release the trimmed down version of this film on DVD!Please please release the 202 minute version.
0	Do Not Recommend: Unfortunately is stopped working a month or so after I bought it at Target. I called the manufacturer and was told to send it to the repair center at my cost and wait 6 -8 weeks until they fix it and return it to me. Very poor customer service too, the technical support rep took a very long time getting my name, address, proceeded to spell my name military style several times....
1	hard swingin: Everyone is taking long, energetic solos in front of a lively crowd. Johnny Griffin wails on his tenor sax. Roy Eldridge creates some amazing sounds on his trumpet. Bassist Niels Henning Orsted Pedersen swings as hard ever and takes amzing solos. Milt Jackson plays long creative riffs. Louis Bellson takes an awesome solo on "Lester Leaps In" after trading fours. And then, ofcourse, the Count: his performance is too amazing, and on "Lester Leaps In" he begins the song with 4 choruses of own special 'stride' piano which was popular in jazz' early days.The songs performed are the1. quick paced blues- "Billies Bounce" (Charlie Parker)13'35"2. the more relaxed "Festival Blues" (Basie, et al)11'54"3. "Lester Leaps In" (Lester Young) based off of Ive Got Rhythm16'06"
1	Scars and All: I have been trying to get this song on CD since I heard Jeff sing it on Crooks and Chase in 98. It absolutely moved me to tears and so perfectly described my relationship with my boyfriend. I was thrilled to read in Country Weekly Jeff is coming back - am anxiously waiting for his new album. What a talent. His CDs will be stacked right under George Strait, George Jones and Alan Jackson.
0	Cornwell can do better: I was reading through some of the reader reviews and one reviewer called Marino the most "put together" character in the book and I realized with a start that this was true! How unexpected that this overeating, cigarette-smoking, tough and prejudiced cop would be the one to stay grounded, while "Bang Bang" Lucy struggles to stay balanced and Kay struggles to find peace and people that aren't out to get her. Problem is, I buy the Scarpetta books to read about Kay and her WORK, not the emotional stuff, and not to see how 90's Marino is becoming. Great forensics, as always, but a mess of emotions, a mess of a plot, and a silly ending that was just too abrupt.
1	Captivating, I couldn't put it down...: I love the Scarpetta books. The charactors in these books seem so real, it is like you can get to know them and their habits. It almost feels like you become one with Kay, Lucy and Marino, you worry about what will happen to them next. I like how Jo's parents have to deal with her lesbianism, and how Kay tries to explain it to them. These books show just how screwed up this world can be, but how there is some good in the world, people just need to be more open minded. This book was a little bit more predictable than the others though, the plot leading up to what I knew would happen. I find that annoying, but still the book was very good. I can't wait for the next one to come out.
0	Not At All Like Patricia Cornwell: I was very disappointed with this particular book. I was hanging in there until about the last 25 pages or so. We got to France and the book just fell apart. It wasn't that great to start with, but some hairy guy. Please. The romance was wrong, the Lucy character is disgusting and just rude. I love Patricia Cornwell, but at the French trip I was ready to throw the book in the trash. I suffered through, but I hope this is her worst, and I will look for suggestions from you other readers for my next. I have not lost faith in this author. Even her wrost has a way of always holding my interest. To me this is a great writer, who just decided to write crime novels. She has great potential.
0	Let's put it together: Over 300 reviews so far, let's summarize the half of them (although I found many very funny): Cornwell's first 3-4 Scarpetta novels were, without a doubt, excellent. These books had a good storyline and believable characters, but in the meantime the series has hit rock bottom and started digging. I am so fed up with Kay's constantly miserable life! Lucy is a spoiled brat and she should have been killed instead of Benton (although he was pretty boring too). What happened to Marino? Come Ms Cornwell, you owe your readers more than this poor little effort. I agree with another reader that Cornwell should write a psychiatrist into her next novel and get her characters a therapy.If there's no other way then end the Scarpetta series and start something new. This is not the way to go! As far as I am concerned I won't waste money on another book. This is so depressing!
0	Could be better....: well, as a die-hard kay scarpetta fan, i was thrilled that patricia cornwell came out with another book. one of the best things i can say about this book is that it is not as bad as the last one. i was glad to be reunited with all the characters that i have grown to think of as family, but the quality of the stories has faded since the death in the subway (true fans will know what i mean by that). although i was disappointed in this book, i will be waiting, patiently, for the next one. if you are losing faith in kay scarpetta, try reading books by tess gerriston, tami hoag or jeffrey deaver.
0	There is No Hope: Unfortunately I gave Cornwell yet another chance to return to the form that made her early books gripping and a worthy read. This one is filled with the now trite themes we've seen before: power brokers plotting against Kay to remove her from her job, internal suspicions at the office, the angst of her personal life, the sniveling and relationships of niece Lucy, and what appears to be the ever increasing stupidity of Marino. The only refreshing thing in this book is that the villian is not apprehended in the bedroom of her home. Thank you Kay for running outside. Sorry Patricia, no more for me.
1	Exciting continuation of Cornwell's talent.: I had read reviews of this book that were not good and almost skipped this one, even though I have read all of her books/ I'm glad I didn't. This was as good as Cornwell get.
0	black notice: I have read all of her books. The last two have been just terrible. She has lost her touch. Try Nelson Demille- he is outstanding!
0	Bad plot & character development, just plan bad=0 star: I was a fan of Cornwell's very early books but in the last few years I have given up on reading them because of her poor writing. I was influenced to read "Black Notice" because of some very glowing reviews on this web site. Luckily I didn't buy the book but found it at my local library. I read the first 50 pages or so and couldn't believe that anyone would publish a book with such poor plot and character development, poor knowledge of police procedure, and choppy unconnected writing style.Ms Cornwell either needs to take a vacation from writing or her editor needs to edit better.
1	Overall, a good read.: I have read all of Patricia Cornwell's books, and I was glad to see Scarpetta back. Even though this novel was weaker than her earlier ones, it was a far cry better than Southern Cross or Hornet's nest. Scarpetta's character was a little too depressed and drug the story down a little. Overall, though, it was enjoyable reading.
1	Great Book one more for a great series: Ok I was reading the reviews and I think alot of peeps are giving this book a bad review. The book has twists and turns but also has a startling sense of reality. It shows that not everyone deals with things the same way. and if you think about it Kay has got a lot to deal with .... How many men in her life has she lost now 4-5 and the romances take a lot out of her because when she loves she loves with all her heart unless shes scared... and everything thats happening in the end just leads to a greater plot in the next Book I cant wait to read The Last Precient
0	Don't waste your time !: I have never been draged through this author's sordid mind before, and I don't plan on it happening again. Her characters are the most implausible group I have ever encountered. She lumps totally opposite people together and never gives us a single reason why we should believe these people would ever have anything to do with each other. She drags us up and down the narrow streets of her mind splattering us with gore and deceit, but never gives us a reason to feel for these troubled characters. It is seemingly an after thought that she finally creates the main villian in this story. He never actually materializes though, and of course it is next to impossible to believe that he even could exist. All that is bad enough, but suddenly and inexplicably the author tires of the entire charade and ends the story so abrubtly that it took me a few moments to accept the fact that it was finally over, and be grateful that it was. Don't waste your time !
0	Continued Disappointment: A new book starring Kay Scarpetta is guaranteed to cause me to pull out my checkbook immediately. Unfortunately, like many of the other reviewers, I found Black Notice a disappointment for a number of reasons. Wesley Benton was a moderating influence in previous stories, and I miss him greatly in the current book. Kay Scarpetta seems less organized, more bitter, and her angst colors the entire story. Lucy has become a distraction, rather than a contributor to the storyline, perhaps she should have been the one killed off! I would also agree with one of the other reviews that the ending of this book was hurried, poorly crafted and undeserving of the hundreds of pages of buildup.
0	Unless you're into frustration, don't waste your time: You never realize how truly disappointing a book can be until you realize that there are approximatley fifty pages left and countless plot lines flapping in the breeze. Cornwell is a master storyteller. Unfortunately, Black Notice if incredibly similar to many of Dean Koontz's books in that the author tells a great story but has no clue how to tie everythign together and end the book. Like Koontz, Cornwell chooses to simply end without tying up many of the plot lines.My advice, don't waste your time.
0	Full of holes and threads that peter out.: The main story line doesn't even start until halfway through the book. There are some half-hearted attempts to tie everything together, but they don't really work.And what's with the niece and her relationship? Its as though Cornwall feels she has some obligation to include a dysfunctional lesbian relationship. WHY?? Its not as though the book's about homosexuality, and its not as though there is an integral character who just happens to be a lesbian. Its pointless. And Lucy is SO unsympathetic.I guess the worse part is that its not really a mystery. There are no clues that would allow the reader to figure anything out. Everything is resolved abruptly. Scarpetta doesn't figure anything out.
0	Better than "Point of Origin" -- but could it be worse?: Okay, Scarpetta, get over yourself. Sure, your life is tough, but whose isn't? At least you're not as cranky as you were in your last go-around. And tell me, when did you stop being a simple medical examiner and start saving the world from every lunatic out there? You might want to speak to your supervisors, 'cause they're putting a helluva lot on your shoulders. And do me a favor, will you? Slap Lucy for me. I know it must be hard to be so smart and find out your ex-lover is a pyschopath, but gimme a break. And if being gay in the '90s were as tough as she makes it out to be, I and a whole lot of other people would've slit their wrists long ago. Doesn't anyone in your family find joy in anything? Maybe this new young stud of yours can knock some sense into you. I hope so, 'cause your adventures are becoming just a little too depressing for words.
1	Anywhere she is....: Patricia Cornwell may take you to a city street in Virginia or to a country across the ocean, but the fact is that Patricia takes you where ever she goes. You cannot resist the tug of her pen as she writes her story all around you. Before you know it, you are not sure if you should put on a pot of coffee for Marino or a neglige for Benton. Thanks Patricia, we can all use a break from our own lives now and then!
0	Terrible: I am midway through Black Notice, the first book I have read by P. Cornwell and I cannot believe she has been a best selling author for how long? Would somebody email me at ajohnson@vvi.net and let me know what is so wonderful about these books? I am not a dodo, but this stinks.. Sorry
0	Cornwell needs to push the narrative.: A few years ago I discovered this series. Mystery mixed with forensic science made for an interesting story. Also you cared about Kay, Pete and Lucy. But something happened to our heroes. Kay became an adulterer. Pete became irrational. Lucy never grew up. And worse, the books started to be more about these characters who I liked less than about the problem to be solved. I just finished Black Notice. I think the whole story could have been told in three chapters and 40 pages. Everything else was personal problems and politics. I love a good mystery. The main characters should be interesting people who you care about but they should always be secondary to the narrative.
0	The Downward Slide Continues: In Cornwell's 'Scarpetta' series, drama has increasingly yielded to melodrama, and characters have deteriorated into caricature. Moreover, the characatures have become revoltingly self-important and Self-absorbed. Scarpetta herself spends a great deal of time deploring the extent to which others fail to accord her the deference she deserves. Her attitude is understandable, though, since the world (as depicted by Cornwell) revolves around her. She is the target of all the villains, and is idolized everyone else. It's sometimes difficult to remember that she's only a medical examiner. I've about given up on Cornwell. Her non-Scarpetta books were dismal failures, and her latest Scarpetta books haven't been much better.
0	A disappointment: Ever the optimist, I bought this novel hoping that Cornwell had improved over her last, disappointing Scarpetta stories. Kay has changed for the worse, remaining hysterically out of control during the entire novel; the realism and credibility of this character has disappeared. The secondary plots are distracting to the point that they overshadow the story line, making it incidental and trite. The climax was predictable and silly, and held no enjoyment for me.Scarpetta is overbearing, controlling and convinced of her own, singular wisdom as she seemingly fights against everyone else in law enforcement. Absurd. Lucy's situations are irrational and her character continues to be focused on her lesbianism (sounds like Ellen). I was disappointed- couldn't wait for the book to end.Save your money.
1	Great characters and wonderful suspense.: I really like this book. I found myself invested in liking certain characters, and disliking certain others, because the character development was so well done. It was accomplished subtly, so as not to bombard you with needless minutiae. The suspense builds throughout several congruent story lines, to hold your interest, and make the reader wonder what will happen next, or what will the outcome be. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes suspense, strong characters, who have a strong ethical presence, and a love of having your imagination activated!
0	Black Angst: As a long-time mystery and Scarpetta/Cornwell fan, I bought Black Notice for entertainment. I wasn't prepared to be a captive voyeur to Scarpetta's angst and to wonder between the lines how much was projected from Cornwell's own psyche. The axiom is that successful writers write about what they know best. I wish she had stayed with fiction
0	I was disappointed in the plot & characterization: I keep wanting to like these books. I don't. Kay is not a likeable person. Marino is not a likeable person (is he even a person?). Lucy is the personification of a snotty brat. Who is the winner?
0	Don't Bother: Patricia Cornwell's books, while not great literature, are still somewhat enjoyable to me. Not so with this one. The plot is absurd, the characters anoying, and the ending very abrupt. Do yourself a favor and buy one of her other stories.
0	What's the Name of this Book Again?: I bought the audio version of this book - I'm 3 tapes down - and I keep asking myself if I've already read it. I came to Amazon.com to make sure this was Patricia Cornwell's latest book. Nothing in Black Notice is very original. It's all a repeat of Postmortem and Body of Evidence. Very disappointing.
0	get a life!!: ms cornwell's stories are interesting, but lately dr scarpetta has become the most whinny, self centered character to hit the literary pages in some time. as for the ending it seemed (and not for the first time) that ms cornewll got tired of writing and just hurried the ending and left me at least wanting more or at least some answeres to the questions she posed in the book. overall another disappointment in the series.
0	Dismal: While each of the vignettes suggests a possibly interesting story, none really lives up to the promise of the book. I think we all understand by now that morally unappealing people can and do own and enjoy beautiful works of art. I'm just sorry I had sit through Vreeland's novel to be reminded of it--I kept hoping it would finally get better, or there would be something to bring it all together, but there wasn't. Very disappointing.
0	I can write better: I might as well read my own juicy but amateur stories for some entertainment. Vreeland's writing was dry dry dry. No magic, no juice, no beauty, no heart. I felt as if the characters were crying out to me, "Please, we have so much potential! Don't let us die on this page as bland imaginings!"Her creations and ideas were unrealized and her abilities (hopefully she has more abilities) unutilized. It was more like reading a book of genealogical studies, except I have often laughed and cried more at a family history book than I did with Vreeland's story. Read Girl With A Pearl Earring instead!
1	Follow that painting!: Vreeland does a wonderful job with this book, which follows the life of a painting, from the present day back to its creation. The style of the story is reminiscent (albeit in reverse chronology) of the movie Tales of Manhattan (Ginger Rogers, Cesar Romero, you remember), which follows a tail coat through its remarkably adventurous life. What makes such a journey insteresting is the way the painting is bound inextricably to the scandals, loves, secrets, and desires of the characters who, at various times, own it. Reading the frankly personal chapters, I almost felt like a private eye, tracing the painting's history and linking the characters together.While Vreeland doesn't claim to be an art expert, she does a wonderful job describing the nuances of the painting, and she clearly has admiration for the craft of the artist. I very much enjoyed this book, and it reads surprisingly quickly. You can easily finish it in one or two sittings. A real gem.
1	Unique and beautiful...: Susan Vreeland beautifully tells the fictitous tale of a piece of artwork by J. Vermeer. We follow the piece back in time through eight stories of previous owners until we end with the hardships of Vermeer himself.Each story transports you to the time and place of the artworks owner. You begin to understand them through the eyes they cast on this particular work of art as it illuminates moments of their lives making them and the art unforgettable.
1	A Book of Short Stories: This book is really a book of short stories woven together and proceeding backwards chronologically to trace the provenance of the painting. The stories are not connected very well although they build on each other, the transitions from one story to the next are not very good but the concept works if you treat each as a standalone story. Where this novel really shines is in Vreelands descriptive prose. She excels in evoking the emotions and feelings evident in a piece of art work, even if the art is fictional. I liked the writing so well that I wished the painting existed so I could see it. The story development itself was a little disappointing but it was a surprisingly quick read.
1	a must read: although this book was in print quite a few years agoi must say its one you can reread and enjoy time and again
0	Contrived: Not much of a book but maybe entertaining for those who want a book for the beach. Tracy Chevalier's book, The Girl With the Pearl Earring, is a much more engaging treatment of the same topic (Vermeer.)
1	Incredible!: I know what you're thinking. Is this going to be one of those artsy "literary experiences" where almost nothing happens? NO! Incredibly, this book is pretty much of a page-turner, with a group of inter-connected stories about a fictional Vermeer painting. The book is done backwards, with the contemporary story first, followed by the World War II story, the turn of the century story, etc. It works beautifully! The characters are so well drawn that you'll come to know them well in only a few pages and you'll CARE about them. You'll also care about the painting, so remarkably word-painted by Ms. Vreeland that every nuance of it is indelible in the mind. When you finish the book, you'll turn back to page one and start again. One of the best books ever, and I read evrything from Sidney Sheldon to James Joyce.
1	Art and Literature: If you've ever held and antique in your hand, and wondered about all the tales it could tell, this book is for you. I understand each chapter was written as a stand alone short story, but put together, Vreeland weaves an incredible tale about one of Vermeer's paintings. If you've ever loved the light of Vermeer's paintings, you'll be even more enchanted by this fictional "story telling" of the life of a painting.
1	A Timeless Piece: The depth of this master piece is timeless for all generations to come. Compared to what we are having on the market today, most of them are cheap, superficial and rediculous, I recommand this movie to everyone; at least watch it once to experiece what real love and real life are.
1	Dr Zhivago: Great movie to begin with and this 2 disc set was especially nice. I enjoyed watching the old interviews with Omar Sharif and Julie Christie which were conducted back at the time of the original theatrical release.
0	Doctor Zhivago DVD Poor Quality: I have loved Dr. Zhivago from the moment it hit the big screen but this DVD copy is of poor quality. It is cheaply produced and you discover that the movie is on both sides of the DVD. It is just disappointing. The lesson is that often when you buy cheap you get a substandard product...lesson learned. I'm going to find an old VHS copy to watch.
1	Those eyes: Lean made beautiful movies. He told good stories. And Julie's eyes can drown you. A movie the story of an observer. One of the good ones. Images you keep.
1	Sweeping historical epic: A sweeping portayal of love and betrayal in the chaos of the Russian revolution. One of the great epics.
1	Bite me: Buffy's not your averege girl. Well she used to be the sterotypical Valley girl who's main concern was shopping and her equally shallow boyfriend. Then she meets the man who claims to be her "watcher" and says that she is the Chosen one, the Vampire Slayer. She dosen't believe him at first but with a little persuation she realizes her destiny. Buffy's popularity at school is falling but she's meet a new guy who makes her smile. The only problem is a powerful vampire is after her, and she may not be ready to take him on.Though not as good as the TV show, the Buffy movie is a great flick for any true blue fans. I'm just glad TV Buffy acts more mature than this Buffy. Though I would be Happy to see Pike guest star on the show!
0	Watch This Atrocious Movie At Your Risk: ....Perhaps if I hadn't become addicted to the far superior television series before I saw it, I might have given it the benefit of the doubt, chalking it up to yet another inferior fluff movie. However, because I had the knowledge beforehand that both Kuzui and Whedon could do much better, I was disgusted by this atrocious effort at comedy. .... Yet, I supposed something good came out of the movie - the role of Buffy Anne Summers. Once matured and smoothed around the edges, the character was a gift to talented actress Sarah Michelle Gellar, shooting her to the level of fame she deserves. Also, it introduced us to the excellent James Marsters, who in my opinion is severely underrated. ....
1	The Ultimate Rom-Com with Vampires in the Valley: With the exception of Luke Perry's painful portrayal of a 20-something year car mechanic turned love interest, the film stand as a pillar for sensationalism brought on by the following TV series. As an avid fan of the sho, I found the discontinuity in the plot somewhat pesky but nothing significant enough to detract from this testament to the wonderful era of Dr. Marten wearing valley girls with one liners to last a lifetime.Basically Clueless meets Francis Ford Coppola's Dracula but with more spandex and David Arquette AND PEE WEE HERMAN!!
0	Nothing new for anyone: Only women who need feminist bravado to feel secure in their womanhood will find this bok useful because it repeats what these sad women need to hear. For the more well rounded woman who's secure in herself, this book is basically useless.
0	Batteries Not Fresh?: I'm giving this product 2 stars because Eforcity shipped quickly and when I emailed them about the inability of the battery to hold a charge for very long they quickly shipped a replacement free of charge. Good customer service. Unfortunately, the second battery exhibits the same behavior, holding a charge---with extremely light phone use---for about half the time the original Motorola battery did. So I strongly suspect these are not real Motorola batteries, or they are simply too old to work properly.
1	Great Look at the NBA in the 70s: Bill Bradley does an amazing job of showing what the NBA was like in the1970s from the small details of what the locker room was like to how race relations impacted the players on his team. His player profiles were so insightful and I particularly enjoyed his looks at non-teammate greats like Oscar Robertson, Wilt Chamberlain, and Bill Russell.I thoroughly loved the book and recommend it to any NBA fan who wants a peak at a bygone era.
0	Does not work: The first four seasons were great. Did not want the episodes to end.This one you cant wait for it yo end.
0	Stick to the first three series: The first three seasons are wonderful! However......after season 3 they try and try....and try...to recapture the magic of the first three and never do.
0	Kindle edition NOT good: It does not read well, as it is a list of items to be further researched and validated with study.And, while the content is intriguing and worth study, the kindle version is nearly worthless.* The kindle edition does not render Hebrew correctly (it's a jumble of characters & letters), though greek seems to come through, usually.* The 'tables' do not align when presented.* There are no breaks, chapters, etc to make navigation easy and this edition as a worthwhile reference.
1	A good Christian understanding of numerology: I borrowed this book from a friend, and after reading it, I've decided to buy a copy for myself.I am always happy to find out about God's original purpose and meaning for things that Satan and the occultists have stolen, perverted, and used for their purposes- things that were meant to help us better understand God and His purposes, which, as it was presented in this book, did in fact do-I felt a whole new world open up for me and I'm not as "afraid" of how I see numerology used all over the world because I understand it better-from God's perspective.
1	Another Very Good Book!: I very much enjoyed this book. It covers many areas and is full of good info. Not a generic book with the word dachshund filled into the blanks. Lots of nice colour photos.
0	Not really good: While the first two seasons were very successful, the third season is awful. THe idea of changing the format slightly is understandable and the creators were probably aftaid of getting in a rut. The problem is that the show was really very good. Until, at first Earls goes to prison, during which time he stops crossing things off his list and then he goes into a coma and it gets worse, a lot worse. Also, while previously the storylines were funny now the want to shock also slightly and the whole concept does not work anymore really.
0	Karma intended for plots to be simple: Karma intended for formulas and plots to be simple. My Name is Earl was never screened on television where I came from for a pretty good reason - the story-line was dumb, the themes confusing and too R-Rated and the episodes beginning to become too stale and painstakingly lengthy. You could sense that the writers were scrapping the bottom of the barrel when they dwelled on homosexual prisoners from rival gangs and prom night in prison. If you want to have good memories of what a great TV series this was, stay away from Season Three.

1	Journey....We Have A Problem: Even though this re-release sounds better than previous ones, at the beginning of the first song, "Girl Can't Help It", a split second of the very first drum beat is missing. Overall, the CD is excellent especially with the added tracks. If you like your recordings of studio music to be prefect like I do in most cases, then this re-release is not for you. Find one used that was recorded from the master properly.
1	Charlie's place: Nothing better then to listen to the music of one of Rock & Rolls legendary voices of all time! Steve Perry!! He has a soulful commanding voice!!
1	Bobby taught Soul1 everything he knows: Yes folks, it's true. Bobby taught James everything he knows. Not to detract from the Godfather himself, but Bobby is just so underrated by most who think they know something about soul music. One must take into consideration that this is a greatest hits compilation and as such has some duds in it as filler. But when you put that first track on and hear that first guitar pickin intro and then hear James back in the sound booth just shouting to get out, it's because he knows Bobby's got soul.
1	Loved Loved Loved this book!: Wow. This book is hilarious!Characters were believable. I felt as if they were people I knew.Storyline was intriguing. Loved the whole betting aspect of their relationship.I read it in one sitting because I couldn't force myself to put it down.Found myself laughing out loud and wearing a stupid grin for most of the book.What a fun read this was.It's one I would read again and again.
0	LAME!: Sorry, but what happened to this author??? She used to be witty and interesting. Now she has gotten so lame. The contrived humor, the one-note characters, the gimmicky plot devices. I used to love her work but the last two books have been real stinkers! Also the stuff with Min's mother reminding her about her weight kept falling flat because these weren't remotely well-crafted or nuanced interactions. Instead, Crusie keeps beating us over the head with what we're supposed to find funny. I wish someone would tell this author to stop trying so maybe her books would feel natural again.
1	Makes you want to start your own snowglobe collection: 'Bet Me' is an absolute, hands-down all-time favorite. While it can easily be categorized as "chick-lit," this story is so much more than that. It's fun, light and airy, has funny, well-meaning, and meddling secondary characters (the couple's friends), a pair of hate-worthy exes, and some very memorable lines from the first page right up to the last. While comedy-romance may not be for everyone, this is one of Crusie's best works and worth at least one read. Just don't be surprised when you fall in love with Min and Cal, too!
0	Unfortunate: After waiting for over a year for a new Crusie, Bet Me was a big disappointment. The gimmicky plot was bad enough (A grown man still betting on whether or not he'll score with a woman? Give me a break!), let alone the cloying cutesyness of the unending props, but what really killed it for me was that I simply didn't like these people. With two minor exceptions, they were whiney, immature, bitchy, bitter, and boring. The minor exceptions themselves were drearily smug. Not even Crusie's trademark style can save this one. Too bad.
0	Cute story, but...: This was an engaging, light read. Crusie is good at writing snappy dialogue, but I could not get past her choice to give her 2 leading characters the very old-fashioned names- Minerva and Calvin! I kept imagining my grandparents, which frankly is not a picture you want in your head when you're reading a romance novel!
0	Very Very Disappointed: I am such a huge fan of Jennifer Crusie, I have read all her books with true giddy excitment. Unfortunately this book did not give me that feeling, it was so bad I started to skim through the book, I have never done that with a Crusie book before. I almost felt like crying that was how upset I was with this book, I have re-read all her books several times, so me saying one of her books are bad is very tragic. I know I must sound so dramatic, but she is my favorite author and I feel I have been let down. I hate to say this but I will be very cautious about going out and buying her next book.
1	Wonderful funny read: This was a terrific story that had me laughing all through it. The characters really grow on you and the plot has plenty of twists and new developments. This is my first Jennifer Cruise novel, but I will be looking for others soon!
1	New York Slick is just that: Great album, perfect for popping in on a quiet Sunday morning and reading the paper or making omelets. Definitely worth adding to your collection.
1	losing control: One of Kira Reed's best. In case you don't know, Kira Reed, a former playmate who besides being beautiful, is a very good actress. The movie has a plot you can follow and keeps you intrigued til the very end. If you've never seen the uncut version on cable you won't know what you're missing, if you have, than avoid buying this movie, you will be disappointed.
0	Ye gods: The worst record I have heard this year. The guy I bought it from sold it because he couldn't stand it. Even the Princeton Record Exchange won't take it.It's not even well-recorded. Or interesting ... even though it seems like it should be, what with Richard Stoltzman's clarinet interacting with percussion and all.
0	Bad. So Very Bad.: This movie has awesome cover art. That is about it. The catering on the set may have been good too(unconfirmed) but nothing in the film was good. The story was weak. The actors were weak. They tried to make the main character look just like Brandon Lee in The Crow. The background music songs were cheesy knock-offs meant to sound like popular songs. For the most part I laughed at it. Bad. So very bad.
0	Yikes! I should have read reviews: Because this is an Apple product, I didn't read the reviews carefully. Didn't expect serious problems.The big issue: Because I am right-handed like most people, the cord does not reach the plug on my MacBook Pro, unlike every other mouse I've used! No where did I notice this limitation in the Amazon product description. I work faster with a mouse than with the Pro's trackpad.Now that I've tried this mouse more than a month after receiving it, it's probably too late to send it back and probably too much of a nuisance.
0	Apple always the best (FOR MAKING MONEY): Just as other customers already said, very simple: After short time the little scroll ball gets erratic and stops scrolling.Why? Obviously because dust gets inside and then makes it malfunction. Unlike all NONApple mouses, here YOU CANNOT remove it and clean it or wash it with soap. Therefore, once it starts working erratically, you can simply throw away you Mighty Cra.. Mouse. Thanks Apple.
0	Love the scroll ball, hate the second "button": It's nice to see Apple finally moving toward two-button mice, but this just isn't the answer. Maybe it is just my hands, but I find it impossibly hard to separate the left and right mouse button. More often than not I am right-clicking when I try to left-. It practice it means I keep doing stupid stuff like removing elements from the Safari toolbar when all I want to do is click.Mine is now collecting dust in favor of a traditional two-button mouse.I do, however, really miss the scroll ball. I know many do not, but for me a normal wheel seems hamstrung once you've used the ball on the mighty mouse.
0	A real bummer: I'm a big mac user, usually love their products, but I gotta say . . . this mouse has turned out to be a disappointment. Two reasons:1. The right-click/left-click technology has never worked.2. The scroller just stopped working today . . . after owning it for only a matter of months. I can no longer stroll down, just up and side-to-side.I've just ordered a new mouse.
1	Great mouse for OS X: It took about a year but it finally gave me carpal tunnel syndrome in both arms and hands. The exposé feature is really bad for that problem. I moved back to aLogitech Optical Marble Mouse (USB/PS2)I once used for a while after buying aLogitech Trackman Wheel Opticalwhich didn't help. But after a few months using that trackball, the carpal tunnel returned so I'm now back to limited use of a Mighty Mouse, trying to use more of Tiger Keyboard Shortcuts and the Universal Access Mouse Keys feature.
1	box set dvd: this order was very well packaged, and was shipped even sooner than i thought, also the product was better than i expected
0	Doesn't meet the reputation: The wimpy treatment of Jesus in this movie is disgusting and misleading. The treating him as a slacker and a dreamer borders on slanderous. Heston's acting is wooden, the plot is slow and stiff and painful to the 21st Century Christian viewer.
0	It sucks: I ordered the Ben Hur DVD and it arrived with the middle piece broken that holds the DVD. So, the little broke off plastic pieces went to the buttom of the DVD and, of course, scratched it. For a classic movie like that for $30 it should be 4 DVD's and have some writing on the top. I waitet for the intermission part to be over after about11/2 hours, and the movie never came back on.So, big, big lemon DVD - don't buy it!!!!Ben-Hur
1	GREAT MOVIE!!!: I HAVE ALWAYS LOVE THIS MOVIE AND NOW I HAVE IT FOR MY COLLECTION!!!! A DEFINTIE FOR ANY DVD COLLECTION-EXCELLENT STORY!!!
1	Classic!: Great old classic, great acting the color and scenes were spectacular,glad I now have it in my collection of old movies1
1	An Excellent Epic: This movie is truly legendary. What I can't stand is people criticizing it for copying other films. Can anyone explain how Ben hur could have "stolen" from Smokey and the Bandit when Smokey and the Bandit was made nearly 20 YEARS after Ben Hur? If you are going to criticize a movie, at least get your facts straight. That argument is just as bad as criticizing The Seven Samurai of copying The Magnificent Seven Ughh, manners people! manners
1	Essential edition: Well, the movie is arguable the greatest movie of all time, and the edition is in fact the best ever so, what more can i add? The image is so astonishing that you even can notice the imperfections of the film, only 2 little things are not perfect, but they are so little that most of the people will not realize. One during the chariot races (only a decimal fraction) and another one during the battle at the sea). The prize is great too. So, make you a favor and buy it.BTW, amazom.com works100 % perfect.
1	The Greatest Hollywood Epic since "Gone with the Wind": William Wyer's epic masterpiece is now in a four disc DVD set with bonus features as exciting as a chariot race, it's the epic story of betrayal, freedom, loyalty & revenge, the tale of a hero, a tale of the Christ. The legendary Charlton Heston who brought the savior of the hebrews Moses to life stars in a mighty performance as Judah Ben-Hur. It's a spectular & sweeping triumph, a mighty crowning achievement, terrific entertainment. See this legendary film.
1	One of the greatest films of all time.: Charlton Heston gives his best performance of his long distinguished career as the Jew Judah Ben-Hur who stood up to the might of the Roman army and became a legend . Charlton Heston and Stephen Boyd are excellent as the boy hood friends turned foes.Oh yeah, watch out for the little chariot race, it's quite good.
1	First time Anais Nin Reader: Delta of Venus By Anais NinExcellent Erotica. This is the first time I have read her work. Will read more.
0	wont buy without listening sample!: the description is interesting, but nowhere to find a listening sample. wont buy a cat in a box! more customer service please!
1	Angelic music: If you like uplifting, soothing music that will waft you above the mundane and touch you to the very core, give Snatam's music a try. You may just love it.
0	not rock and roll: I bought this album when i was converting from tape to cd and could not find This Means War, or Beyond Belief on cd. This one had the songs on it that I was looking for but the original versions compaired to the new versions is like some one took a Metallica song and had the Back Street Boys sing it accapella
1	Awesome: I love this movie...its so classic, and like a Disney but buff and with more romance. Girls kick butt and the fightin scenes are the greatest...one of the best Foreign films Ive seen.
1	Classic Chinese Folklore: Anyone and everyone in America has grown up on the fairtales of Europe. This is one the best movies out there about a classic chinese tale of swords and sorcery of horror and love. As the title suggest. I can't really find the words to explain it but this movies rates up there with Fong Sai Yuk1 and 2. Its that good.
1	WATCH VIDEO WITH AN OPEN MIND: I just finished watching this video and I have to say wow this truly blew me away. Great collaborations, great sounds and footage.The only people singing in this video are those who appreciate and understand Bob's music. It is not Bob Marley who is singing, so stop criticising the rap/reggae mixes. Not all the songs are about rap/reggae. The majority of the songs are reggae.The extra footage on the video was excellent and surprised me.Only downfalls in video are "waiting in vain" performance???? and an absense of bunny wailer and bob himself =)Lauryn Hill (my babes)was awesome, Ziggy was outstanding and Stephan blew the video up with "High Tide or Low Tide".Overall it is a good video and recommended for those of both old school and new school reggae/rap/ragga
1	GO OUT AND BUY......NOW: The best live album from the pulse. Extremely tight sound and reminds you of steel pulse at their very best. I kept playing this CD over and over again, but then again I am Steel pulse number one fan.IT MAKES SENSE TO STUDY REGGAETOLOGY!!
1	Great Purchase!: This book is full of fun activities that can be used in my classroom. I would recommend this book to any Language Arts teacher!
1	A great book for all ages to appreciate!: This book combines humor and wit with lessons appropriate for all ages. The author is able to paint a clear picture of the joys of being friends with people who are different. The illustrations are fabulous, and you will want to read this book many times over.
0	a very shallow character: I enjoyed the reminders of the fifties but I couldn't get past her shallowness. When one of her friends starts to date a boy that is out of their circle she suggests that her friends class finally shows. She is an avid reader but seems so unconnected to anything that is going on in the world. I don't think she would have been someone that I would have been interested in when I grew up in the fifties. I thought it was a story going no where and had a hard time finishing it.
1	Red Sox Version of Moneyball...Great Book!!!: If you're a Sox fan, and are interested in the history and certain insider information involving certain Sox moves that may not have been the most popular, you'll love this book. It goes into the history through the current ownership and how close the John Henry and Co. side came to NOT owning the Sox. I grew up near Boston and have followed them closely my whole life, and this book gives me information that I did not know about, kind of a different perspective.
0	It's junk don't buy it: It's hard to cock, it's hard to load, it's hard to shoot, and then it doesn't even have power to penetrate cardboard. I wanted to give it to my wife, so she could chase rabbits, and stray cats out of her garden, but the effort to squeeze this trigger makes my hand shake too much to hit anything, I doubt if she could even squeeze a shot off. It looks real eneugh in a dim setting to possibly chase away an intruder. Though pointing a fake gun at someone is probably the best way to get your self shot, so I wouldn't recommend it.
1	Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle's Magic: Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle's Magic is about an old widow named Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle who has cures for everything! For example: The Interrupters Cure, The Tattletales Cure, and The Never-Want-to-Go-to-Schooler cure. One time Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle had to use her magic on a boy named Christopher. Christopher had the worst table manners in the world! Christopher's mom called Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle to see if she could help. Well, Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle had a pig named Lester who had the best manners is the world! So Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle let Mrs. Brown keep Lester for a week. Lester taught Christopher the best table manners in the world! I'm10 years old and I don't like to read books, but I loved this book! (Parents would too)!
0	One of the worst films ever made?: What alternate universe did the makers of this film come from? It doesn't even deliver on the ick factor like Ilsa She Wolf of the S.S. did. It's just plain embarrassing.
1	Their best CD no doubt: I didn't care to much for their music after "Core" and "Purple"... or so I thought. I just knew what I heard on the radio. I bought "Thank you" just to see and then I bought this one. "Shangri-La Dee Da" was so good that I had to go back and get "Tiny Music From The Vatican Gift Shop," which is also excellent by the way.
0	STP goes Pop...: What a mistake it was to buy this CD. This is one of those CD's that has1 or 2 good songs on it. I was expecting the usual STP hard rock that made them famous, instead this CD is 90% "STP does Pop music". I wish I could take it back to the store...If you like Pop music, you may like this CD. If not, don't buy it...
0	They coulda' aspired to be so much better..........: ... However...I anxiously awaited "Shangri", bought it the day it was released, and an hour later had a great little coaster for my table (the CD was subsequently broken in a game of Trash Frisbee). The songs were so trite and repetitive that any positive aspects of them were lost to redundancy. After listening to it, I would have rather sat on Satan's lap in Hell than be subjected to such a horrible display of otherwise talented individuals attempting to all of a sudden be happy-go-lucky pansies. I mean, how do you go from "No. Four", in which the speaker is confronted with his own sins and shortcomings on Judgment Day, to "Hello It's Late", which is just an unoriginal rehash of "Amazing Grace" (I mean, Amazing Grace is a classic song, performed by everyone from Johnny Cash to Dropkick Murphys, but come on...).The rest of the album is equally empty and suicide-inducing to most serious music fans. Don't waste your time, money, or mental well-being.
0	This is why you shouldn't marry and have 2 kids: SW, after going to jail and releasing two sub-par records (NO4 and this one), has so much nerve to marry and father two kids, when because of the commercial failure of both, is going to find it a challenge to support his out-of-control, multiplying-like-rabbits family. There are heavy reasons this coaster of a cd hasn't even sold past gold status: because it's a pain. THat's why. Every song gets worse as you listen to more on the track list. You'd think it wouldn't be possible, cause the chances of one being good would neutralize all of 'em being horrible, but it's not to be. This is so bad that if STP back in '92-'96 would have heard of what nightmare they'd turn into, they would commit suicide; or at least would beat up their future degenerated versions.
0	STP goes out with a whimper: Possibly the last album from Stone Temple Pilots, 2001's "Shangri-La Dee Da" is undoubtadly the worst album from the band. Most of the tracks featured here either sound too poppy or too generic, and the lyrics ("there's so much God can teach you...") are trite and uninspired. Scott Weiland's voice sounds great though; when this album was being recorded he was cleaned up (for a little while anyway) and his voice greatly benefited. As for the rest of the band though, I can't understand what happened to them here. "Coma" and "Hollywood Bitch" are standout tracks, but that's about it. All in all, if your a new fan of STP, check out "Core" or the brilliant "Purple" before listening to this disappointment.
1	can't wait for their next album: In1994 I bougt their single Plush. Vasoline was the next one.In1996 I heard Trippin on a hole in a paper heart. That song was in my head for years. Last year I bought Tiny Music for thatsong. A great album with no bad song on it. No 4, purple and Corewere next. Maybe a little late but not too late to became a fan.Their last effort Shangri-La Dee Da is a classic too in today'sirritating and narrow-minded music scene. Shangri-La Dee Da gotgreat rock songs on it. In addition I also like their soft side. It was like listening to The White Album. Even the fiercest critics must admit that STP got a great endurance. I can't waitfor their next album.
1	BAD TIMES FOR MUSIC!: I just listened to Shangri La Dee Da and, to be honest, is not what I expected, I liked it though, but there's nothing to do with the STP I was used to.Lots of people say STP and other american bands are having a bad time,(maybe because Pop is everywhere) while british bands are taking the lead.Shangri La Dee Da is not usual coming from STP (personally that's what I think), but people should consider Scott is living a happy new life and that makes the difference.Good Work, I will always be proud to be a STP fan!
0	Maybe Dave Coutts wants his old job back!!: Tool is the best band nowadays, for the one, sorely sensitive reason that stp are failures: as stp's career has furthered itself, their albums have died. Tool, on the other hand, only continue to get better with each release. STP NEEDS to stand to take a lesson from Tool's page, and stop putting out fearsomely abnormal pop garbage. To every mistaught, five-star reviewer: you should employ excessively MORE virtuous standards, like the Tool analogy, in your spitefully self-righteous, hidden agenda reviews, where you fake that stp's shangri-la is buyable.
1	Great insight into one of the best selling album of all time: This is a great DVD from the classic albums line. the DVD is split into 2 sections part1 is 50 minutes (?) It goes into great detail how the band put this album together. The interviews were excellent and Steve Clark finally gets the recognition he so finely deserves (and has done for years). I think they should have had more than a 30 second interview soundbyte from Steve though. This dvd also features promo videos for different songs both live and through music video. In closing on section1 I thought this album had the band at breaking point though it was very draining on all on them to get the results that they got.The second part about 50/51 minutes Joe and Phil take you almost track for track telling you how each song was put together. Joe and Phil also perform unplugged versions of songs from Hysteria. Overall this was a very DVD I got mine for... and I thought it was wellworth shelling out for in the end.
1	I bought the cd on a whim and gut instinct...: and I don't regret buying it. It's an overall fantastic cd. I was trying to think of who her voice resembles. I'm reading a lot of Janis Joplin, Alanis Morisette, Sheryl Crow but I would like to add Stevie Nicks (voice wise) on some of those tracks.My favorite tracks are; Just a Little Hole, LA Song, Is That Too Much To Ask, Get Your Sh*t Together, and Mama.Her voice will, undoubtedly, catch you but don't pass up her lyrics while it does...
0	Misleading: I just got this unit and must say that I am disappointed. It maybe because I was expecting it fully decode hdmi audio instead of having another optical in for the same source. So when I connect my PS3 I can not listen to full uncompressed audio in LPCM which is available only in hdmi. If you have only optical audio to take care of, you will be find with this receiver. But if you are looking at it just because it has "HDMI", beware and read the fine prints.
0	A poor book overall.: Flashes of what could have been a great story, but ultimately disappointing. The final pages seeming attempt to turn the story into a fable were too little too late.
0	Horrid, Disgusting and Vile: I found this to be a work of no redeeming value. I treasure my books and I threw this one out. I wanted the hours of my life I spent reading it back. The characters are flat, the plot stale, and the action lame. Additionally, every woman in this "novel" (and I use that term loosely here) is a prostitute, betrayer, or sadistic torturer. Stay away.
1	Great Movie from a Beautiful City: I really enjoyed this film and I do not generally enjoy subtitled movies. The characters were believable and I enjoyed watching the relationship between Mehmet and Francesco slowly develop into a physical and emotional bond. The only reason I did not give this film a 5-star rating is because I disliked the ending. I felt that it's message was one about the hopelessness and futility of gay life and that it has no serious future. This is simply untrue. There was no need to make the wife into the type of character she became. Great scenery and a rich introduction into Turkish culture and family life.
0	Pointless movie!: This movie is pointless. It's not erotic. It's not poetic. It's not passionate. It's not dimensional. It's not dramatic. It's just plain boring, and it doesn't even look very good. Most of the film takes place in dark, dingy rooms. The lead actor (Vittoria Gassman's son) is attractive, but not much in the talent department. Skip this movie.
0	Buy a Different Edition: This edition was scanned from the original using Optical Character Recognition software to keep the cost down, therefore, there are typos that resulted from smudged or worn pages. While this information is disclosed in the book as well as in the product description from Amazon, the typos can be distracting while reading. Also if you need to read the entirety of the novel, do not waste your time with this edition as it only covers chapters1-31. There are many more than that (63 I believe). Overall, I would not recommend this edition to anyone. Do not waste your money on it!
1	An Irresistible Winning Comedy! Halarious!: This movie si really funny and one of the best of1997, it is very original and it gets it's laugh in a very unique and honest way. The acting is great and the actors are perfectly cast, the accents are a bit heavy, but you can still understand. I recommend this movie to anyone who's looking for a good comedy and a good time.
1	I loved it!!!!!!!: I took my husband to see this at the theatre and didn't tell him what it was about. It was one of the nicest afternoons that we have spent together in years. Even my 75 year old mother enjoyed it. My son just bought me the sound track for Mothers day!
1	Different and great....: This movie is " different " and great as achange of pace from the standard farethat is available. Watch this movie andbe totally engaged in a new experience--and have a great time to boot.Highly entertaining and I do recommend itto anyone seeking a good time movie.
0	A test of credibility: THE FULL MONTY is a movie buff's test of credibility. It doesn't have the suspense to carry on as a drama. If it is a comedy, the film is a one joker. It is predictable to the nth. Scene A: We're off, we're going to get going with our nude revue--oh! oh! there is a problem that we have to sort out with one of the guys who is going to back out of dancing in the nude and that's funny! Scenes B,C,D etc. : Same as Scene A with a different guy ad predictalitum. What ever happened to those good British comedy story writers who gave us Wrong Box and Ladykillers?
1	A classic!: Must read. If you like poetry, then you must read Beaudelaire. This book is actually part of the French curriculum or was at least for a very long time when I was at school and still it is a pleasure to read as an adult, also maybe even more because I know can read more into it. A must..
1	excellent book: We love this book so far and it came very promptly after ordering. My son likes this year's literature much better because of the stories covered in this publication.Thanks! We'll order again from you!
1	Soulfull and Gorgeous Writing: I don't know where to begin with my praise and appreciation of this book. Right off the bat I loved the atmosphere, the harbor and the lobstering, the lapping sea and creaking boats--and, in the midst of these atmospherics, the lobsterman's inner life.The author's ability to enter the minds and sensibilities of these four people is wonderful. We see how differing perceptions take their toll. I was especially impressed with his ability to fathom and render the many layers of the women. I'm definitely going to check out Mr. Weesner's other works. The writing is at once elegant and unpretentious. The people are likeable and complicated. The story casts a spell. I loved it.
1	Any Gardener's Must-Have Book: I have other gardening books, but none of them are as easy-to-follow or as comprehensive as this one. The text is so much fun, it's easy to read cover-to-cover. Yet, if you need specific information on a certain type of vegetable or technique, the index is very easy to use. The appendix gives the dates and growing seasons for every major (or minor) city in the U.S., as well as additional resources and catalogs to consult. A wonderful resource for a novice or an experienced gardener.
0	Terrible toffee: The toffee tasted like butterfinger bars... ok...if that is what one thinks toffee should taste like.. Very underwhelming.Dissapointed and will not buy this brand again
1	A writer's book: This is a book about becoming real in a world of unreal people. Not many of London's regular fans liked this book, a little too real for them I suppose. But, writers love this book and with good reason. If you write and haven't read this, put it in your shopping cart right now. If you're looking for a classic Jack London adventure story, skip this one.
0	Not famous for good reasons.: Three chapters on doing laundry. 30 chapters on trying to get a story published. Stupid ending. Not worth the while.
0	Broke.... After I broke it with a hammer!: What is she thinking, all of the song have absolutely noappeal. I listened to it once and that was all it took for me to hateit. Her voice is sqeaky high and nasaly like that of Suanza for those of you who know who I'm talking about. No soul and all her malismas are weak, without skills but repetition in the studio. I certainly hope Suanza won't try the same in the future. One huge embrassement is all we need for the Asian community.I would have gave it NO stars but in order to share with all of you my opinion, I had to give her at least one. Just to let you all know negative 5 stars is an understatement. END
0	Oh Please!: First of all, the lady should not go around declaring that she is the first asian singer to sing R&B. (It's more like a tacky version of R&B-pop) Nor should she go around (for she did in Asia) saying that she hopes the Grammy committee will consider her as a nominee (God forbid).The songs lack soul, although she has a nice voice. Most of her songs lack substance, and she trys to be hip and everything but fails (plus she even has two songs with almost the same title!). I have no idea why Kelly Price would want to guest on this CD...Coco Lee can do much better than this. She had better, if she ever wants to be considered a world-class singer. Disappointing. Don't know what the hype has been about.
0	My God! where is the creativity?: Wow... as I express, I don't know what those song writers and singers are doing? Sampling others has been a trend that pretty much thumbs up our music industry thus far (Yeah. all you copy cats, you know who you are!) I find it very tiring listening to her music. First I have to be proud that she is first asian ever hit the U.S. market. BUT, I am so disappointed that she didn't do it with a BAM! She tries to hard to imitate artists like Mariah Carey, Celine Dion,and Whitney Houston. All the songs are pretty much the same from track1 to track10. (I gave it away the next day. I should've bought Best of Mozart! ) Please bring back the nuances!
0	What a disssapointment: Wow I waited all this time for THIS - what was he smoking. Is this the new trend to try to be like Outkast and mix bad rock with hip hop.Come on Mos you can do better. This album is unlistenable and it almost pains me especially when I compare it to the first.3 out of19 songs are just OKThe Easy SpellChampion RequiemLife is RealIt's too bad. He is going to have to come again in order to claim back his respect.The mystique is no longer
0	WHAT HAPPEND!!!!!: I REALLY LOVE MOS, BUT I HATE THIS ALBUM. THERE ARE 3, MAYBE 4 GOOD SONGS ON THIS SELL-OUT FEELING ALBUM. THE SONG WRITING LACKS THE SUBSTANCE, AND DEPTH THAT MOS FANS MAY BE USED TO. THE CONSTANT REPEATING OF; YEAH YEAH, UH COME ON UH, LEAVES ME WONDERING WHERE ARE THE LYRICS? IF YOU LOVE THE THINGS THAT SEPERATED MOS DEF FROM STANDARD HIP HOP DO NOT BUY THIS ALBUM.
1	The Unthinking Brilliance Of A Casual Genuis: Most people will be put off by Mos Def's new album on the basis that it's different from the norm and what they are used to listening. I have read reviews treating it as Hip-hop and reviews treating it as rock. I've yet to read one that views it as I do as an eclectic amalgamation of all forms of music that are dear to the artist. This album is Mos's own; it's selfishly his own. Yet some of the tracks appear to be put together so casually that it is all you can do to listen and revel in the sheer brilliance of such haphazard beauty. I would Mos Def recommend this to all lovers of music, if however you constrain yourself based on genre, you should be careful. This album makes 'The Love Below' seem like a cynical commercial cash in.
0	New Danger should have been danger.: Mos Def has produced great albums, but new danger is not one of them, this is utterly forgettable and predicable dud, featuring a plot on this album that is so ridiculous the songs are over the top, mos def singing and everything else is so preposterous, it makes KRS-One happy, I Hope he does a better album next time.New Danger Album Review *1/2 Star.
0	Horrible...: When I heard that Mos Def was coming out with a new album, I couldn't wait. Black On Both Sides is one of my favorite albums ever and I picked this up as soon as I could. When I listed to it I couldn't help and be dissapointed. I was expecting something much better than this.
0	Garbage, garbage and more garbage: Mos Def spends a good portion of this album making gripes about something or another.Here is my gripe to Mos Def, thanks for wasting my $15 with this crap album.Now Mos Def not only makes bad movies, but bad albums too.
0	ehh,,,take a pass: I have to say that Mos kinda crapped out on this one. I was expecting a lot more out of this album than what I got. The album is ok, but I wouldn't go running around telling people to buy it. I stlll will enjoy Mos on other levels,,,specifically I against I, a track you can find on Daddy G's album. That track is amazing. Sorry Mos, you should of worked harder on this one
1	A Master Statesman/Politician: A well documented video on the life of Britain's finest statesman/politician, Winston Churchill. The video was everything I expected and more on this man's life. Well done!
1	Lost Potential in Spy Drama...: A young mathematical genius, Tom Jericho, is returning to the British code-breaking center during World War II after he has been sent away due to personal problems. They are now trying to crack the new code that the Nazis use when they communicate with their U-boats, since it seems like the Nazi's are now trying to attack convoys coming from the US with food, ammunition, and other equipment. The British Intelligence Service is very suspicious of how the Nazi;s knew that they had cracked the former code and they begin to scrutinize Tom's past. Enigma can be described as a cat and mouse game that has a soul, but lacks flesh.
1	Flawed but very intelligent WWII thriller: Enjoyable, smart WWII thriller about code breaking, based on a true story, and notable for being a war filmmore about human intelligence then daring action. The script by Tom Stoppard is strong.While it's a very good film, some irritating flaws keep it from being great. With the exception of Kate Winslet, alot of the acting is over the top. Worse, the film wimps out on the true story, and misses some fascinatingcomplexity, since in real life the lead character was gay, at a time where that alone was enough to win everyone'sdistrust and indeed he faced persecution in the post-war years rather than being hailed as a hero.Further, the whole style of the film feels old-fashioned in a way that goes back and forth between charming andfeeling forced.And yet, all that said I'd still urge people to see it, for daring to be a wartime thriller with smarts.
1	A great find: I stumbled upon this album and immediately fell in love. The songs resonate in memory; the emotions expressed are universal experiences; the feeling way they're presented is unique. Nick Reifsteck has a rich baritone that has the same quality the great Ian Tyson possesses, evocative and lyrical. You can dance, you can just listen, you can cry--this album runs the gamut from giving opportunites to just get the old ya-yas out, or to reflect on the fools we all are for love.
0	the shadow of her smell: ok, now THIS one is dick & liz at their most self-indulgent. even "boom" (not yet released on dvd, alas) is a better movie, if only because it is sooooo bad. it is amazing to realize that right after this, arguably her worst performance, taylor went on to give her best in "virginia wolff". i have given this a second star because the shorts about the making of the film (included on the dvd) are pretty interesting. only for dick & liz completists.
1	One of my favorite love stories: I was able to see this movie in high definition ON DEMAND USING XFINITY/COMCAST. The picture quality was equal to a Blu ray, however is was full screen. The movie titles were in 2.35 widescreen. NOW FOR THE QUESTION,SO................HOW MANY YEARS WILL IT TAKE TO CREATE A BLU RAY???????????
0	Not One For Wedding Processions: Adult literary techniques do not always translate well to children's books. Although there is some interesting insight into the lives of children that shows through this book, the writing is forced. Having not read the other Rootabaga Stories, I can't say if Sandburg wrote everything this way, but this particular story is probably one of the most annoying books I've read to my child. The awkward illustrations didn't help either.Having said that, a book is a book and everybody enjoys different kinds of books. I would simply recommend checking it out at the library before you buy it.
0	Another Disappointment: At this point I am undecided about this whole series. Once I get over the poor writing style, the overused cliches and simpleton dialogue, I can usually get through her books. Usually her ideas are phenomenal, but the execution tends to be mediocre. It is so frustrating-think of what a good writer could do with these story lines! This book is no different. The idea is awesome-a Dark Hunter falls in love and impregnates a half Appollite who is destined to die. But once again, the execution of this idea sucks! And it doesn't even make sense half the time. For example, Wulf is squeamish about drinking Cassandra's blood and initially refuses. Even though it would save her life! And Cassandra accepts this. Come on, give me a break. Plus the "out" that Ash gives them in the end is way too convenient. I will try a couple more books in the series because I did like Night Pleasures and Dance with the Devil, but if they are anything like this I'm done.
1	Love Kenyon's books !: I recommend her books highly. She also writes as Kinley MacGregor, Highland series, and those books are wonderful, too. Her romances are heartwarming, fun, intelligent and believable. You can't put them down.
1	Finally a plan of action...: I read a few other books, and they were good in that they told me what I needed to change to be a good husband. This book was different in that it had a plan on how to repair your marriage and how to use what I had learned in real life. It had a few steps that you both can do to get on the right track. I appreciated the honesty and frankness of the guidance. You or your spouse has the option for divorce, but if you don't want to choose that, it show you what you need to do and work on to fix things.
1	Piano trio at its finest: My favourite type of jazz is the piano trio. And the Roberta Piket trio is fabulous. I picked up this cd in a store, not knowing anything about her, and I have to say, it is one of the best buys I have ever made. Not only is she a wonderful pianist, but she is also a terrific composer. On this disc they play 3 of her original compositions as well as 4 standards. With her wonderful improvisations and reharmonizing the standards become brand new again. On two of Pikets originals, 'Just a Blues' and 'Five-Four Play' the trio is joined by saxophonist John O'Gallagher. I really can't praise this cd enough, just go buy it and see for yourself that the future of the piano trio is in very good hands.
1	Without question, one of the most complete movies I've seen.: I can only add my voice to the choir of accolades for this thought provocing, moving film. Few films are as complete in every respect in which a movie can be. I have searched for a copy of this film for five years, and can but wonder why films of much less repute are released while this epic is kept from us.
0	Very disappointing: I've never read Michael Stackpole and was pretty happy with the first book in this series..couldn't wait until the second one came out. Of course, the ending was a bit of a shock (the author's own notes warn about ill will towards him because of it) but I still was hoping the story would pick up a bit of speed and resolve itself in the third installment. What did I find? Ho-Hum...I had to force myself to finish. Nothing is resolved to any satisfactory measure - the most important character is a lump of clay (literally) and the other characters just seem to start fading away. We can't always expect a happy ending, but there didn't even seem to be one at all! A thoroughly disappointing way to spend some hard earned cash. Next time one of his books come out I'll be sure to see if my local library has it first so I at least don't bother spending my own money.
0	FALLIN' FOR SAW PRODUCTION: It didn't work for Kylie Minogue, neither Bananarama, the SAW production it's the music that dated the less gratefully from the 80's music. So Summer take on this ill advice move, although yes we all know she returned to the top10 with THIS TIME I KNOW IT'S FOR REAL, the sound on this album sounds extremely dated, and hearing the entire album it's extremely painful since I DON'T WANNA GET HURT and LOVE'S ABOUT TO CHANGE MY HEART sound extremely equally the same. This record does not differ from other produced SAW, who in fact could be say was pure 80's POP disposable music, no wonder they didn't promote Kylie's 80's music in America, it was like this Summer album painful.
0	Worthless!: This book is 50% old exams (old, and current exams are available for free on the USPTO website) and 50% snippets from the MPEP (also available for free on the USPTO). The snippets are have plenty of errors (both typos and in content), its outdated, and provides almost no useful information.It provides only the highest level of overview that doesn't come close to anything that will help you pass the patent bar. If you don't want to spring for the expensive study aids and think this is a cheap way to get some help, you're going to be very disappointed. You're much better off slugging your way through the old exams and MPEP on your own. If you write down the first sentence in every major section of the MPEP, you've just about wrote this book.
1	My husband's Fav Shorts: Finding these cotton thin mens' shorts are difficult - they are the only ones my husband will wear. Their year-round cotton comfort and roomy legs and waist is what he wants. He likes the pockets and the drawstring waist too.
0	Not true to size: I ordered these shorts to replace my husband's old pair of Russell shorts. Although I ordered the same size, the new ones were far larger, and the fabric was much thinner and lower quality than the older shorts. I sent them back.
0	Terrible Sizing: The sizing of these shorts is a joke. Read all the reviews very carefully before buying - something has changed within the last couple years.
0	Not100% Cotton: I have been looking for some cotton shorts that look good on me and these are not them. The crotch area is way too long. Most important, these are not100% cotton. I was under the impression that they were all cotton, being that they are supposed to be premium.
1	Got what i needed!: Pretty much got what I was looking for. It fit my dinosaur of a band saw and the shipping was quick and cheap. 62" blades are extremely hard to find but amazon pointed me to the right one.
1	A beautiful voice and spirit, for singing beautiful music: This CD must be close to the best, if not the best, recent addition to my growing collection of Christmas CDs. Jewel's voice has a unique vibrancy which suits it pervectly for traditional Christmas carols. Her renditions of "O Holy Night", "Silent Night", "O' Little Town of Bethlehem", and "Ave Maria" are the best examples. On the other hand, she conveys a relaxed and swinging style on "Winter Wonderland" and "Rudolph, the Red Nosed Reindeer. Her inner spirituality is feelingly expressed in her own originals, "The Face of Love", and "Hands". I hardly consider this a CD to use as background at a party. It's too beautiful to waste on a group not really listening to it. Instead, I recommend it for personal enjoyment and to share with special friends of like mind.
1	Wonderful CD.: I have never purchased a Jewel CD before and this was a excellent start. I thought she has an angelic voice and I plan on buying more CDs of hers.
1	What a pleasant Christmas CD!!!: I was always a quasi-fan of Jewel, but this CD cements my fanship! I never realized just how nice her voice really was, or how beautiful her folksy Christmas songs would truly be.The pictures in the liner notes of the silvery, snow covered field really suit the whole mood of the album, too! It's beautiful! The kind of Christmas music that you just sit down and LISTEN to, if you know what I mean!Winter Wonderland, Silent Night, Joy to the World, Hark the Hearald Angels Sing, and the Go Tell it on the Mountain medley are perfect for Christmas in the countryside (where I live)!Oh Little Town of Bethlehem, I Wonder As I Wander and Hands capture that feeling of searching in the wind and the snow and then finding the true spirit of Christmas! And Oh Holy Night is the most beautiful thing I've ever heard from Jewel! I didn't know she could SING like that! It's wonderful!Highly recommended for anyone who wants to relax and enjoy soft beautiful music this Christmas!
0	Merry Jewel: This is the closest thing to mainstream folk Christmas album anyone will get. Although there are backing vocals and an orchestra thrown in for extra holiday glee, this still sticks to a campfire sing-a-long feel. Jewel's vocals stray close to yodeling territory without getting too uncomfortable.A Holiday Collection remains not as exciting as other season albums, even with a helping hand from a jingled-up version of "Hands."
1	Jewel has an awesome voice: Jewel's christmas collection is awesome, she really hits those notes, this is an awesome cd for anyone who loves music. Donna
0	Pass on the '06; you'll need the '07 by the time it arrives: I ordered this calendar as a Christmas present for my friend at the beginning of December with a shipping estimate of about the16th of December, and the16th of January is approaching and it still apparently has not shipped. In my opinion I should receive1/12th of it for free since my friend won't be able to use the January page; along with a complimentary Christmas gift for next year. But instead I decided that I would do the world a favor and save them the embarrassment of wrapping and giving an empty box with an IOU note as a gift. You can't use an IOU note to keep track of the date. So please do ME a favor and pass on this calendar no matter how attractive you think an actor might be. They're not very attractive when they're stealing your hard earned greenbacks, think about that. Oh and by the way I've also been forced to give this item one star of which it doesn't deserve since to my knowledge it may not even exist. Thank You.
1	good headphones: I use these headphones with my clix 2 and not many complaints here. The cord is kind of long but I can deal with it. Decent sound. The only caution that I give is to avoid turning on the headphones while wearing them and music is playing. Also, when batteries start to go it can cause some weird, loud noises.
0	not bad, but cheap: got these headphones as a gift about a year ago and just started to use them more frequently. sound quality was better than I thought for what I expected from logitech although I feel the noise-canceling feature was weighted in one ear (the one with the battery) and that produces a hiss which is kind of annoying. Then they started to just fall apart. first a little black square panel. then another piece cracked off. actually have tape on them. Within the next year I'm thinking they'll just turn to dust. There are better headphones out there, but if you are dead set on these they don't sound bad.
0	ear piece broke after one year use: It worked great for about a year, then it broke just above the ear piece. The mechanic design has flaw. It breaks easily.
1	Great Value for the Money: I just wore these on a trip to China. Worked awesome on the airplane drowning out cabin noise. Made the trip much better. I was able to hear the movie much better than with my other ear buds. I have not tried the more expensive Bose units, but for $40 these were well worth the money!
1	Best Book Ever: Have you ever heard of the Redwall books?. I would highly recommend this book to people whom like fantasy, love adventure, adore animals, and like an action packed adventure. The book starts out with Martin (a warrior mouse) walking along a snowy path. Martin will eventually go on a quest to Salamandastrom. He goes there to find Boar The Fighter. Sadly, Boar is killed in a battle. On Martin's quest to Salamandastrom, Gonff, Young Dinny, and Log-A-Log accompany him. The Woodlanders verse the Kotir Army outcome is unpredictable. So it's your choice, (A) go charging over to a book store and buy this book, or (B) don't even listen to me. Pick A
1	Michael Whatley's review for Mossflower: This book is an excellent thriller with mystery and non-stop adventure on every page. You just can't stop reading this novel of a lifetime.
1	An adventurous aminal tale.: If you like action, suspence, and adventure, this book has it all. I gave it five stars because it's very well written and excitting. You should read it! I'm trying to read the whole series.
1	"Amazing, exiting, every one who reads it will love it!!!!!: This book is Jacques's best work. Who ever reads it will love it. Touching, funny,sad everything you need to make a book perfect!!!!! Ones who open it wont be able to put it down! This is so great, you will have to read it, you can find it HERE or in book stores. Look for more of Brian's work like Bellmaker, Mariel of red wall & others!
1	This was a gift: This was a gift for my husband to replace a casette tape he had for many years. He wanted it in the CD version. He was pleased to be able to find it.
0	Looks great but wont fit BMW keyfob: Well isnt the #1 job of a BMW key chain to fit a BMW keyfob? The slot in the keyfob is too small to insert the ring into it. You have to get a second smaller ring and attach that to to the keychain ring. Otherwise the keychain looks nice and is made with quality.
1	An alternative to Wheelock: I have finished Wheelock and its workbook. I am now using Learn to Read latin and its workbook to both take a different perspective and consolidate my effort to read Latin after a seventy year hiatus. Learn to Read latin serves that purpose. Very good selections unaltered from the original.
1	Great movie: I always rent from amazon always great qualityNever any streaming issues. Great prices I use amazon strictly I no longer use other rental options
1	OEM, worked like a charm: OEM GM part, direct fit, solved defroster issue, got radio reception back. Need I say more?... apparently I do because it won't let me submit the review without putting more words. That should do it...
1	Like Being in a Popcorn Popper!: I first heard Jonathan Richman in the movie "There's Something About Mary" but at the time I wasn't as interested in music and didn't seek him out for a better listen. Many many years later, my uncled played the album "I, Jonathan" in the very somber setting of his son's memorial service. This was music my cousin liked. For that reason I will always have bittersweet feelings about these songs, but I think it also proves how bright and happy they truly are. You really can't help but move around. Like my uncle said, "It's like being in a popcorn popper!"
1	Greatest party album with mellow songs and dance songs: the disc gives you a feeling maybe that summer feeling because it will haunt one day in your life. Just like this cd does if your into fun and entertaining music by a musician that you can actually understand this disc is for you. Roomin' house rocks i've seen some cover bands do the number i would love to see jonathan live one of these days pick up this one.
0	Doesn't Hit The Mark: I have seen quite a few productions of COMPANY including the original on Broadway. Unfortunately, this one doesn't come close to hitting the mark. In fact, it's way off. If the director were trying, once again, to be innovative by imposing his concept for SWEENY TODD onto COMPANY it doesn't work. ANOTHER HUNDRED PEOPLE is perhaps a good example how this fails. Were the singer and the musicians really together? I heard not. It's a tough song and this singer couldn't keep up. Who could be better than Beth Howland anyway (grin). And unless my CD player is failing, a lot of the times the singers sounded quite flat.What surprises me the most is that Sondheim would sanction this. And the weird thing for me is that I enjoyed SWEENY TODD, directed by the same John Doyle.
1	Company: Excellent production values characterize this latest Sondheim CD. Vocals and instrumentals came through with remarkable clarity so that the words could be understood and none of the Sondheim wit was lost.
1	Definitely a great album to chill and read by the fire.: If you love piano and hearing a maestro exhibit amazing talent and passion, the Koln Concert is definitely a buy!
0	WARNING: Product Rip-off !: WARNING! The bridge assembly shipped is nothing like the photo. It is much cheaper in construction. The package is branded as "Kluson":- the actual individual saddle adjustment screws are NOT contained within the body of the steel bridge (as shown in photo), they just sit in open slots and so they pop out easily.- the actual individual saddle adjustment screws are NOT Phillips head screws (as shown in photo) but are cheap slot head screws.- the actual bridge saddles are NOT pre-grooved (as shown in photo), and grooving them yourself is a royal pain in the butt.- the holes in the bridge body for the vertical adjustment screws are NOT chamfered (as shown in photo) and so the bridge body does not ride smoothly when adjusted.Basically, the bridge assembly shipped by W D Music is total junk. It deserves a negative star rating.
1	Liberalism: A Spiritual Cancer: Most books on controversial subject matter embody a certain element of overkill to prove their point but Michael Rose is 'shockingly on the mark' with, Good Bye! Good Men. Many in Detroit have lived through what Mr Rose describes in his book. A close friend was subjected to professional psychological counseling for a year (at his own expense) and needed none. The final report read, This client did not need counseling and has no sign of pathology or abnormality. Basically, he was just too Catholic. The current sexual crisis in Holy Mother Church clearly shows what the Liberalism of1960-1985 produced. This brand of mis-guided and unholy leadership never results in reform or progress. Through the concerted efforts of current Rector, Bishop Allen Vigneron, Sacred Heart Seminary is healing from what I call "Metastatic Liberalism" and today continues to heal and grow in Grace and in Favor with God and Man. Glory to God!.....a student
0	Take Another Look Please: This author doesn't explore the real issue of what the church considers valuable, instead, he stays mired in the same old sacrifical muck. He tries to explain that the liberal years of the 60's through the 80's caused much of the church's decline, but many of us life-long Catholics in the real world have a somewhat different viewpoint. Narrow minded thinking and the belief that only men can run the church, has now caught up with us. But this off-limits subject certainly isn't explored. Now with the harsh light of truth shining on the recent ugliness, perhaps men with power in the church will listen, and perhaps now they'll start to widen their outdated stance about women taking larger roles. And maybe someone will even have the courage to write a book about it! If you want to read the same old stuff on Catholicism, only with a dramatic twist, then this is your book.
1	IT IS WHAT IT IS: This film footage was filmed in low light conditions (stage lighting conditions only), so the picture quality is a little grainy - but no big deal. Walsh's voice is fine - don't be fooled by the "purists". Overall, this is a good DVD and I would recommend it to anyone.Here's the negative: Aside from poor lighting, as I listened to the DVD, it just seemed like some things were missing. Case in point - I believe there should have been another guitarist at least. A piano would have been nice. The lead guitar riffs came up short. But then, trying to compare a concert sound with a studio sound would be fallacious.
1	The Viking!: This is the best NHOP cd I have ever heard! Most of the songs are traditional Danish "Folk songs", re-arranged by NHOP in one way or the other. Ole Kock Hansen, on Piano, has been a friend of NHOP since his childhood. He is one of Denmark's most abundantly gifted musicians, and it really shows on this particular cd. Lennart Gruvsted, is an outstandingly and accomplished drummer from Sweden. His work here is beuatifully coherent and sensitive. All in all i give this cd a top score. As I'm from Denmark, I fully understand the feelings, and moods that these 3 muscisians creates, and I hope that you will give this one a chance, no matter where you're from - just remember to have an open mind before listening to this cd, and hopefully you will have as gret an experienxe as I have had listening to this masterpiece. Thank you, and happy listening :)
0	Pathetically Awful: The original serious was pretty good. This1999 movie was so painfully bad that it looks like it was the last thing the writer, Buddy Ruskin, the creator of the original series, ever did in show business. This flick is so godawful that I'd rather watch a loop of Roseanne Barr singing the Star Spangled Banner.Co-producer Aaron Spelling must have been mortified at the final product.
0	Loud, Bright, High Action! And Borrrrring: Amazing how so much action, noise, pulsing rock music and lively young actors can add up to such a dull movie. I rated it one star because Amazon won't allow Zero stars. This one is unwatchable, literally. Not even laughable so you can't sit there and mock it. It is just boring and dull. Rent anything else at all - you're sure to like it better.
1	Inspired and Brilliant: I didn't love this as much as I loved "Mere Christianity" but I did really enjoy the amazing insights of C.S. Lewis into human nature, the spirit and temptations. He really was an inspired and brilliant man.
1	Understanding the enemy: This book was an awesome read and really opened my eyes to how the devils operate within a Christian mans mind. Beautifully written, Lewis is one of my favorite authors and was an extremely talented, beautifully versed man. A literary masterpiece due to the way it was written and the effort one must put forth to see what Lewis was actually saying apart from what was put down on paper. Enjoy!
1	I loved reading this, but I am sure it was not easy to write!: Absolutely great. Not an every day read, but something to pick up on occasion and read through.
1	a must read: a must read, as applicable today as when he wrote the book. C.S. Lewis had insight intopeople and there characters.
0	Not for learning Thai: I have to say if I were Thai and wanted to learn english, or use it to speak english for me, this and other models will do. But this does not work both ways, it only speaks english and translates to english. If you try to take thai script to english you will end up with nonsense, and a few laughes. It is a shame with the tech available that they missed out on making a great product. I have a talking english spanish translator from franklin that is simple to use and useful. I can only hope they will learn from their mistakes.
1	Amazing: I bought this CD for my husband, and he was estatic when it arrived. The music is amazing and calms the sould on a wild and chaotic day.It was also in its original wrapping which I was very pleased with.
0	I didn't enjoy reading Frugal Families.: I love Jonni McCoy's first book, Miserly Moms! It has so much information and recipes that I have read it several times! And give copies of it as gifts. This book, Frugal Families, was boring. I won't be reading this one again. Not enough interesting information.
1	Lots of tips: Great book on frugal living. However, this book doesn't suggest ways to cut down on grocery costs. Gives several different areas on how to save like Pet Care and Gardening
0	Good music, but not the advertized music: I bought this CD after hearing Lucia Micarelli's incredibly compelling version of "To Love You More". You can hear the song at her website, luciamicarelli.com. However, the snippet of music above called "To Love You More" is *not* that song, and sadly it's what got stuck on the CD.
1	beautiful music: my husband wanted this for a certain piece of music he had heard but the whole total of music is stunning.hes fallen in love with itcompletely.
1	A beautiful strory; beautiful people; beautiful land.: Having lived in China for seven of the past10 years and having traveled to Mongolia many times over those years, I was surprised to find a movie which reflected the "souls" of the three nationalities I've known here: the Chinese, the Russians, and the Mongolians. In "Close to Eden" the cultures don't clash with each other; rather, they meet and reflect each other's strengths, pains, and (in the end) humanity. It is a story of a Mongolian family as seen through the eyes of the Russian truck driver in a remote area of northern China. Each culture is holding on to its own while it must intereact with the others. The actors are not "slick" or polished; in fact, most of them are not even professional actors; they are Chinese, Mongolian, and Russian people being themselves. And the movie is better for it.
1	CONTAINS SOME OF THE BEST LYRICS I'VE EVER HEARD: This album features14 killer songs. There is not a "B" cut among them, and "The Last Comanche Moom" contains some of the best song lyrics I have ever heard. Only Kristofferson's "Sunday Morning Sidewalk" has ever "pole-axed" me with similarly powerful imagery. It is a complete novel in a song with no wasted words. Hats off to Mike Blakely. I hope that he has more in him, 'cause I'm fast wearing this one out.
1	Comprehensive, Fact-filled and a Time Saver: This book is a must have for students of all ages. It provides the URLs of some great sites for information on virtually any research topic. This book should be considered a major resource for any high school student with questions about their homework; it contains comprehensive, fact-filled pages of information. It can be used as a summary, a resource, a starting point to seek further information. Using a search engine to locate sites with content equivalent to those listed in this book would take days. I would recommend this book to the highest degree. It should be noted, however, that if you are looking for specific information (statistics, demographics, etc.) you might be better off with a good search engine.
1	Quick delivery: This book is awesome and my husband who is a duck hunter and hunts with his yellow lab LOVED this book. Its was delivered fast and the packed great so that the book arrived undamaged!
1	Great food..: I am a long time fan of Mr. Slater and have purchased three of his books, this being the third. They all are wonderful. They assume that the reader knows a whisk from a wine opener and has at least a passing interest in making and eating great food. The health-food craze, the move toward low-fat, low-salt, low-this or low-that (and hence no fun) is acknowledged but not adhered to. Slater's emphasis is on good food. If that means adding a walnut sized knob of butter or eating a somewhat large amount of bacon, then so be it. My one objection, and it's really my own fault (He is from England, after all), is that the version I purchased is the English edition, and all of the measurements are in the metric system. Maddening but not a disaster. I also highly recommend "Appetite", a similar book...all in all a great book.
1	a classic jefferson starship cd: if you are a true jefferson starship fan you must add this classic cd to your collection. the cd is chock-full of the beautiful ballads and hard-rocking masterpieces that made the starship one of the best bands of the 70's/80's. do not pass this up. this has been a hard to find gem and we can thank amazon.com for un-"earth"-ing this jewel.
1	This book is a must read for anyone visiting Louisiana.: I was able to use the information to customize an entire1 week vacation for my family. If you like "out of the way" places and "different" things to see and do, this is the book for you. There should be a book like this for each major city in the United States.
1	Tragic and Touching Story: This movie is great for someone who prefers a certain European twist to their films. The characters do an excellent job in portraying life as it was in the time period. Johnny Depp and Christina Ricci carry the movie along well until the resolution. The end is so abrupt and in a sense leaves the viewer hanging. Aside from the sad ending, the movie is excellent to curl up on the couch on a quiet evening and watch.
0	avant-garde failure: i personally find johnny depp and christina ricci to be not only excellent actors, but incredibly aesthetically pleasing, so i looked forward to renting this particular film. Some reviewers of "The Man Who Cried" argue that the talents of the starring actors saved an otherwise horrifying script, but i disagree; not even sexual appeal could save this movie for me. i found the plot dull, difficult to follow, and unconvincing. if you adore these actors as i do, look elsewhere to fulfill your depp/ricci sweet tooth.
0	SADLY ONE OF THE WORST FILMS MADE!!!!!!!: GREAT CAST / HORRIBLE SCRIPT / LAUGHABLE PERFORMACES / A WASTE OF TIME , MONEY & FILM / THEY PUT SOO MUCH MAKEUP ON THE VERY BEAUTIFUL CATE BLANCHETT THAT SHE LOOKS LIKE CARNIVAL CLOWN & THAT IS SAD / DEPP LOOKS LIKE HE WANTS TO KILL SOMEBODY / RICCI PLAYS A RUSSIAN LITTLE ORPHAN ANNIE VIRGIN AND TURTURRO LIP SINGS OPERA AS A HORSE RELIEVES HIMSELF ON THE STAGE / SOUNDS LIKE A COMEDY BUT IT IS NOT / STAY CLEAR OF THIS DISASTER PLEASE.
1	Great stuff!: I remember this album (remember those???) from the early 80s -- a roommate of mine at camp brought a tape and introduced me to it. That was it -- I was hooked on these English chicks! Surprisingly, there are some very sweet songs on this album -- "What A Shambles" comes to mind. This album just brings back great memories for me -- it's great! JAY.
0	Could have been better: While the book had the potential to be very interesting, the wording and style only dragged on creating a book not only difficult to read, but impossible to get into.
0	Come on please.........: I hear so much fuzz comparing their music to the Beatles. Do yourself a favor and dont ever repeat this. Im sorry to say this group doesnt even get near to PFR in quality of music. This cd is awful!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1	Flawless is flawless: This is a clever, engaging story, beautifully portrayed by Demi Moore and Michael Caine. It's a movie about a diamond heist that doesn't rely on car chases or explosions.
1	great movie: It's a great!The only problem is no English subtitle on film.Cause I am a customer of oversea. So it is a little bit diffcult for understand what the story of film.
1	Gift: This was a gift to our son. He was thrilled to receive it and will continue to enjoy it for many years to come. He is a wood worker and is interested in all sorts of books about wood working and wood workers.
1	A good look into the insights of interface design.: 'The Humane Interface' was a very good book. I particularly enjoyed the discussion about the metrics used to quantify the efficiency of a given interface based on its information content. Important stuff.That portion of the book should be required reading for anyone designing an interface.
0	Don't believe the hype!: As a mechanical engineer, I've used all kinds of CAD programs as well as other types of software. This has to be one of the worst software packages I've ever used. The interface is maddeningly archaic. It makes one wonder about the caliber of programmer that Broderbund is hiring. It also makes one wonder who's writing these reviews, some hardly seems believable after actually experiencing the software.PLEASE, do yourself a favor, don't believe the positive reviews, and save your money. Given a technical background, I lulled myself into believing I should be able to handle it in spite of the negative reviews, and came away severely disappointed.Stick to a general 2D drawing program such as AutoCad, Vellum, or Visio, it'll be much less headache and still fulfill 99% of what most users are looking for.
0	Disappointing and frustrating: There are many whiz-bang features that sound impressive but are of limited use in my experience.The basic functionality of this program is impaired. The user interface in not that intuitive, the graphic response is extremely slow, the lack of a functioning "undo" is maddening (in the Edit menu there is a "undo" button, but it is never available). I found working with this program to be very slow going, frustrating and tedious, and I found the payoff (seeing a new home in 3D) to be unrewarding. The 3D view is not that helpful; it is so difficult to control the movement within the 3D view that it is hard to concentrate on what you've just created. Also, you can't walk up or down stairs.I spend a lot of time working with complex audio/video programs and this is, by far, the most frustrating program I've ever used.
0	do not buy this if you have a new system, lots of conflicts.: I liked the idea of being able to design a house from scratch, rather than just move walls around. I started with Punch's 5 in1, but it locked up my system. Their technical support people told me that it was because I was running ME and I should get their professional suite. The professional version locked up my system just like 5 in1 had. After another hour on the TOLL FREE line, no luck and the product will be returned.
0	A Deflating Turn of Events: What began as an interesting novel and journeyed into an interesting form of describing humanity and some of our worst shortcomings, ended without any of the characters transforming into something new and preferably better. I felt cheated by how this story ended and refuse to believe that all of humanity is as hopeless, narrow-minded and self destructive as what was represented by the main character, Soledad.
0	Unable to use: I was not even able to use this product as the instructions were not very clear on how to install. There were conflicting instructions within the instructions themselves.
0	Disappointing: We had the older model of this showerhead so figured the new one would be even better. We have been disappointed in it because like others have said, it will not stay in the correct position and creaks when you move it. It also does not have the great water flow that previous versions have had. The final nail in the coffin was when we moved and tried to get it off, the threading area was so cheap that it broke off when removing it. And we had only had it on the shower for a year.
1	The Search For A Flexible Showerhead Is Over!: When you're 5'2" and your husband is 6'1", a flexible showerhead is a must! When our previous model finally bit the dust, we began looking for a replacement. We scoured the big box home improvement stores and department stores and were unable to find a suitable replacement. Thanks to Amazon, we're now back in business! This model is very similar to our old Shower Massage- it's easy to install and has a nice range of spray options.
1	Couldn't live without it!: I have had a water-pik shower head since they were first developed and only came in white. The only thing about them is if you bend the goose-neck too much and too many times, eventually the skin will break. Of course, this was over about17 years!! Wouldn't live without it, it's wonderful! Can be adjusted with one hand to either flow over the head, under the head (does not get my wife's hair wet) or spot-place it for soothing water massage. I bought one for each bathroom this time.
1	Flexible Shower Head: We had trouble finding this type of shower head in Hardware Stores. Our previous one, the same brand, Waterpik, lasted14 years. I was delighted to find this on the Amazon Web Site. It arrived in two days and took less than 5 minutes to install. My only concern is that the chrome will wear off and it won't look good. Our previous shower head was vinyl coated and still looked like new but the hose had finally given out.
0	cheap and leaky: leaks at the joint real bad...also the dial part is cheap - and feels frail - water pressure not very good...a total waste of my money.
1	Great for tall people: I have had a shower head like this in the past so when it came time to replace the old handheld one we had, I went looking for this type. I couldn't find it locally so was pleased when Amazon had it. Easy installation (no thread tape needed, uses a rubber seal to tighten against) and you can aim the water pretty much anywhere once installed. I am 6' 4" and this is the only shower head that I have been able to actually get under. The rest of my family is very pleased with it too so I would recommend buying this shower head100%.
0	Higher price and lower quality: Have spent hours looking for this item, the original was white and very sturdy. The flex tubing took a lot of abuse and it never cracked or broke. Only used this new model for 6 months and the connector that attaches to the wall pipe split and cracked which now leaks everywhere. I used the white one for about10 years with no problems. Would really like to find the original ones that were a better quality and made with stronger materials.
0	White Boys do Steel Band??: I didn't care much for this CD. As my title indicates, this is just a few mostly white boys doing cover of groups that I don't consider Caribbean music. Jimmy Buffett? Carlos Santana? Some of it gives you a good hint of steel band music, but it left me wanting more. Skip it if you're looking for authentic steel band music.
0	basically, a failure - more on Victoria than Vincent: Technically, the writing style is very poor. If this was "ghosted," Victoria should get a refund. But, basically - what you've heard on the street about this book is more or less true. For a child that wasn't around all that much, she is writing more from other sources. I hardly expected an unbiased opinion from the child of a broken home, but some of the none-too-subtle suggestions that Vincent was 'bi' and so on - without any factual evidence, only gossip - not to mention WHO CARES - is just too much. Another instance of licking one's emotional wounds in public, I'm afraid. Stick to the marvelous Lucy Chase Williams book, and the interesting recent book put out by Midnight Marquee.
1	Best album of "the poets": The canadian poets have offered to us their best album "up to here" with their all time classic "New Orleans is sinking", great rock n roll with heavy blues and southern rythms, amazing style a very defined personality , Mr Gordon Downie is a genious also a man with a great inspiration and artistic sensibility, we need more songwritters like him, The Tragically Hip is also a very united band, members have remain the same for over 20 years they havent fall into the trap of fame and their style doesnt change for commercial success , they feel happy with their legion of die hard fans like me that will always love the hip as our little selfish secretHM
0	There Are Much Much Better Books Out There For Dumbbells: This book is extremely basic. If you want to get into lifting dumbbells you will end up buying Dumbbell Training for Strength And Fitness by Matt Brzycki and Fred Fornicola and Men's Health Ultimate Dumbbell Guide. Those book are great for starting up and improving. This book was of no use to me since I also bought the above mention books.
1	Great Collection: I thought this cd was a great collection of movie themes played on the grand piano. It sounds wonderful!
1	His Third Best !!!!!: Owning this LP since1975 and last listening to it about10 years ago. This is Mangione at his top three best. Behind Children of Sanchez and Tarantella LPs and in front of Live at the Hollywood Bowl. This is a must buy for anyone who likes Mangione. Recorded live at Massey Hall in Toronto with the Hamilton Philharmonic Orchestra and Ester Satterfield on vocals. The quartet,orchestra, and vocals are Fantastic!!!!!
1	Useful tail bag for day trips: I like the look of the Iron Rider series of bags, and the small roll bag is a usefull addition to my detachable luggage. A little too small for an overnight, it is great for day trips for carrying water, laptop etc, and looks pretty good on the bike, even when empty. I haven't tested it in bad weather yet, but it looks like it will keep things dry for a while (unless you are in a hurricane). I rated it 4 because it was made in the PRC, and not in the USA, (which it is priced for) - I wish manufacturers would clearly state where their products are made in their advertising, so that when you buy an "American" product from a US brand, you get something made in the USA. This doesn't mean that there is anything wrong with the quality of the PRC produced product - I just wish I knew that before pressing the "buy now" button.
1	You Must View this Film!: I teach sixth graders. We spend time learning about the Holocaust from our WWII unit in our SS book, as well as, our novels. I have just added a film to these studies..."The Children of Chabonnes". All I can say is WOW! It was more touching, informative, and upliftingthan I imagined. It was wonderful. I thought of a hundred ways to use this in school...ok, I may be exaggerating, but it is goingto be a great asset to our curriculum. I cried at a few beautiful statements which I don't do easily. The members of this crew are to be congratulated for a job well done! Guess I better have tissues ready in my classroom. The music was perfect...and the camera shots, dialogue, and updates on the "children" added a valuable, insightful component to this award-winning testimonial!
1	Must read!: This is the best thriller I've read in a long time. The suspense and the triumph over evil make it an exciting read, but the little dog grabbed my heart. I read it twice and cried both times when I read about him. You will fall in love with Seattle and rejoice with him when his life finally begins to come together. This one should become a best-seller.
0	Sent the wrong part: The company sent me the wrong part. Because they are not part of Amazon, I had to return the item and reorder it elsewhere.
1	Powerbook G4 replacement battery not bad.: Fits great like the original and looks identical but battery life is probably 90% of the original. Can't beat it for the price though. I recommend it.
0	not so hotsie: This screenplay shows the authors have writing talent, but that it is not very developed yet. William Goldman helped write this screenplay, and even HE didn't think it was that great a screenplay (as he says in "Premiere" magazine). I know it won Oscars for the writers, but then Sylvester Stallone was once nominated for a best-acting Oscar...what does that tell you about the award? I think this screenplay showed promise, and I hope the writers try to develop their skill further, so that one day they may write a good screenplay. But winning an Oscar, they may think they don't need to improve, and that would be bad for them and movie audiences, both.
1	Night Play (Dark Hunter, Book 6): This is one of my favorites of Sherrilyn Kenyon's Dark Hunter Series. I must have read this book at least10 times. I highly recommend it.
1	This is why I read paranormal romance !: Great book. I have all the Kenyons books. They take me away from the everyday and are much better for you than that pint of chocolate ice cream. This one is more of the same....perfect. I loved the brooding hero and it was nice to see a plus size character. And for the reviewer who felt a size18 was obese....it's amazing how Mae West managed to look so good with her obese body. And I just know Marilyn Monroe at size16 must have disgusted us all. Please re-evaluate your concept of "obese" .
1	Sweet movie: This movie is a family favorite. We love Gary Sinese in any case, and Hallmark never disappoints. The vendor got this to us in one day!
1	An amazing chronicle: I don't usually go to superlative praise, but this personal little journal is mesmerizing. Begun in1914 by a fifteen year-old German schoolboy, it records his observations from the outbreak of the First World War through each major historical moment to the invasion of Poland in1939. In his own innocent words he marks the major stages of German struggles from the start of war, the end of war, the Versailles Treaty to the advent of Hitler as Chancellor, the empowering of the Nazi Party, and to the Second World War. He shows his gradual maturing from an enthusiastic patriot to a jaded young flyer conscripted into a war he cannot personally support, yet cannot avoid.A genuine and amazing chronicle.
1	not Return to Lonesome Dove but entertaining: I prefer Return to Lonesome Dove over Streets. Some think McMurtry tried to hard to distance this from Return and messed things up for the fans. I wont argue. I do like the production, rewrites, and cast. They help it to be an improvement over McMurtry's book. This movie has it's moments. Far better than the book. Not a bad one to watch when you've run through Lonesome Dove, Return, Deadman, The Series, and The Outlaw Years.
0	Terrible finish to Lonesome Dove.: If you read my other reviews you will see I am one of the biggest fans of Lonesome Dove and even Return to Lonesome Dove. But Streets of Laredo is nothing like Lonesome Dove except for the names. Call a bounty hunter give me a break. But what is even crazier than that is Lorena married to Pea Eye. I think Larry made this so far out there to get back at Hollywood for their movie. What he didn't realize was he was hurting the fans who loved Lonesome Dove so much with this stupid ending. Any true fan of Larry's Lonesome Dove has to know this was not the way he had envisioned this to end when he wrote Lonesome Dove. Very disappointed in Larry's ending, give me Return To Lonesome Dove any day of the week.
0	Don't Let the Smooth Taste Fool You&#65533;: It just sounds like the Stone Roses. Vocally, that is. In the aptly titled Unfinished Monkey Business, Mr. Brown gives further creedence to the theory that the whole is greater than the sum of it's parts, and the parts, when parted out, suck. Since we last saw the swaggering Stone Roses front man, we see he may or may not have learned how make use of a Casio keyboard (see track12), he now practices some form of cool guy martial art (see jacket photos), and probably just put this crap out 'cause he was running low on puss (personal assumption by me). By track six, with some horrid female guest vocalist, any illusion that this record was worth half my 24.85 plus tax was blown. I wonder if they accept opened merchandise for returns.
0	Men couldn't get away with that...: The book's title says it all - I'm the victim, and, damit, I want out! No mention of maturity or responsibility whatsoever. I'm a male BPD and am angry at the oblique, reverse bias so obvious in this book. She throws a tantrum and gets 'support'!?! I can only dream of getting all the help I need and can't get away with the things she does. Support is something I have to give myself in trying to recover.All I can say is that it must be nice to have money, and I'm not liberal. Seems that only women can show emotion - when men do it, they get thrown in jail.
0	ridiculous: I usually enjoy psychology-related books, but this one was ridiculous! It was looong and tedious, and her drama queen behavior is downright embarassing. If I ever acted like she did, my husband would be out the door! He must be a fool. I've never come across anyone who is as full of herself as this woman is. I highly doubt this book can actually help anyone.
1	The waterpik trs-559: The waterpik trs-559 has two water filters inside the attachment to your water line. One is white and the other is black. The manual says you can choose not to install the white one, but pull both of them out. If installed this way I kid you not the handheld is the best handheld shower I have ever used. Without the two filters water flys out the handheld as amazing speed. If installed my way this handheld is worth twice what amazon want you to pay. This product is top of the line better than the 50 60 70 dollar handheld trust me.
1	Great for the price!: Our shower head on our double headed unit broke so we bought this item as a replacement. It was super easy to hook up as a replacement to the original and works great! Love the pulsing option, it feels great on a sore back.
0	Disappointment: This hand-held shower head doesn't have the usual force associated with a shower. The massage is weak and not at all invigorating. I am not happy with this purchase.
1	Very nice!: Easy install, good pressure, and good quality material. I'm very happy with this purchase. I wish the combo spray was a little bit wider, but I'm just nitpicking at this point.I would buy again.
1	Very Impressed: For this price, this is the best shower head you can get. I thought it would be a flimsy piece of junk but it is really a very well made product, a solid handle, strong spray and a long hose. You can't really ask for a better shower head in this price range.
0	Adequate, barely: This is the second one we've purchased, and although it does the job, it's pretty limited. As far as the head goes, the massage and mist settings aren't useful, but it works ok as a regular showerhead. The real problem is that the hose they use now is way too rigid for the application. Even after a couple weeks, it still hasn't laid against the wall. If we had a showerstall, this would definitely be a problem. See the picture. Buying a better hose for $15 or more sort of eliminates the savings.
1	SIMPLY THE BEST: Waterpik TRS-559 Elements 5-Mode Handheld Shower, Brushed NickelBought this, we installed it, and it is wonderful. Perfect for a standup shower, or just to take handheld and spray. Great for cleaning thebathtub too. A truly quality product.Rosemarie - Rhode Island
1	A sense of assurance: A friend gave me this book as a gift, as she continued to watch me struggle bouncing from relationship to relationship and freely giving myself when I shouldn't. This small181 page book, allowed me to search into my soul & find what God was looking for: the true me...a Lady in Waiting.It's been five years since I was given this book, and I am now happily married and I have found my prince in shining armor. I gave my alabaster box to the Lord and he gave me the gift of true love. Praise God!This is a MUST read for all young women!!
0	Not a great movie, but interesting anyway.: It is a given that this movie is not the same type of movie that Scott Glenn did previous to it. Then again, not many movies can't compare to "Silence of the Lambs." After the first15 minutes or so this movie becomes a lot better. Once Glenn finds himself on the Navajo Indian Reservation he becomes the typical fish out of water type character as he looks to return to Los Angeles with a suspected murderer, much like Val Kilmer's FBI character in "Thunderheart." Even that movie is far and above better than "Shadow Hunter," but do not let this discourage you. It is a good rental, and you may never watch it again, but the mystical aspect of Native-American culture will suck you in. Enjoy!
0	Poor Quality: I took my family's advice to go and shop on Amazon.com for the things I need everyday and am very disappointed. The shade is of cheaper material than dollar store napkins and half the size of my compact car's windshield. I will never buy from this buyer again.
0	Ghost: I triedTo watch this movie six or seven times. It would not stream for me. I worked with amazon to resolve this problem, it did not work. I cancelled amazon prime.
1	Soppy but good movie!: I have seen this movie many times over the years and I still enjoy it. I miss Swayze. Whoopie made me laugh out loud.
1	THIS MOVIE HAS SOMETHING FOR EVERYONE!: I was one of those people who did not run to see this movie in theaters and waited many years to see it on video. I watched it again recently in my home theater and it holds up amazingly well. It has elements of romance,action,comedy,suspense and even horror! Yes horror! It may not be the gorefest we see now-a-days, but demons dragging their victim to hell after being impaled by a huge plate glass window falling like a guillotine through their chest qualifies in my book. The story is ingeniously written and Whoopi Goldberg steals the show and won a well deserved Oscar for her role as a "psychic medium" in this classic tale of greed, betrayal, revenge and unbound love! I have the older edition and the transfer looks excellent.
1	" Ditto ": Phenominally successful film, about a man named Sam , who is killed and begins his journey to solving his own murder , as a ghost. Simple plot , however , the story is told with a fantastic cast. Whoopie Goldburg gives an outstanding, Oscar winning, performance as the medium that helps , Sam , communicate and get his earthly revenge. Everyone says this is a great film. I say , ditto.Highly recommended drama.
0	Barely a Mention of Slavery!: How can a professor write a book about the Revolutionary War in South Carolina and not talk about slavery in some detail?....very bizarre.stay away and beware anyone who recommends this book..which at times feels like just a chronological list of battles over a 24 month period in South Carolina.
0	About the condition of this item.......: I bought this movie for my daughter who had one when she was younger and it has somehow disappeared. She loves the story, characters, and music in the film. The thing I have issues with is the condition of the item. It was clumsily wrapped in plastic, the case is damaged and yellowed. If you are buying this as a gift, don't expect it to look new as it definitely doesn't. Since I purchased this as a Christmas gift, I went ahead and opened it to examine the film. It looks fine and plays properly; however, there are seven and one-half minutes of previews and COMMERCIALS at the beginning of the tape! I'm very disappointed with this purchase, but will keep it because I may not have time to order from somewhere else and receive it before Christmas.
0	Product is fine but the service stinks: I ordered one of these for each of my 2 cars. The one for the Town Car is great, but they sent me the wrong one for the second car. I contacted them and am STILL waiting to hear from the company about getting the correct one.
1	Thought it was easy.: I worked with it without reading any directions, so for this I give it a thumbs up. I do however wish I could have drawn a little more accurate with it (I am an autocad design/drafter) so if it would have been more autocad friendly that would have been nice. The only thing else I wish I could have done with the program, that I was unable to do, was design a screened in porch. The system allowed me to design a deck and an all weather room, but I could not get the look of a screened area. Overall I felt it was easy to use, teach and quick to design/redesign. The files take up very little space. I give it 4 out of 5 stars but have no other deck design program to compare it to, it is the only one I have ever tried.
0	Pale copy: Yeah this is a pretty bad album!I liked it when it came out but unlike Queen's albums this one got old pretty fast.It sounds a lot like THE WORKS queen's period-not the greatest either but...-without the magic and the inspiration.THE CROSS is a good rock and roll band and ROGER TAYLOR a great singer and composer but this album doesn't reflect any of those qualities unlike Mad Bad and Dangerous to Know and Blue Rock (2nd and third CROSS albums)Which are real cool energetic rock and not a pale copy of Queen.
0	Handle slides off!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!: Used this for about15 minutes before I noticed the black rubber handle sliding off the fiberglass shaft. Had to constantly smack it back into place just to get the job done. Returning item.
1	Superb!: If you want to have an instant website without wasting a lot of time, this is the book for you. The CD takes you step by step to creat a fairly sophisticated website with input forms, scrolling/fly in text, differing themes, inserting pictures and video. etc. Using the CD, I really did not need the book all that much. Well worth it!!!
0	Plagiate: This book is a plagiate of Mika Waltari's book "The Roman" (original titel "Ihmiskunnan viholiset", published1964 in Finland and translation in English published in1966.SHAME ON SLATER!
0	Great for reference, horrible otherwise: This book was witty and a great reference for all things mid-century and female-oriented, but beyond that wasn't much of anything. Homosexuality is never really covered in regards to women and doesn't really analyze or comment on things or even try to understand the why behind it: the book is just sarcastic in a rather juvenile sense. The best part of the whole book is when Peril indicts Betty Friedan for being a part of the pink think problem.I actually got the impression from the book that if you happen to be a contemporary female who is feminine, you're evil. And that is sad.
0	Mislabeled--this is a cat toy: While this is a nice toy, according to the packaging it is a cat toy, not a dog toy. Fortunately I was able to give it as a gift, but had purchased it for my puppy--not suitable at all. Orka toys are generally great, this one is just mislabeled.
0	wrong product: Product was the wrong adapter - could not get reimbursement - or rather get a return code to this date - very difficult to deal with the company - still no results in refunding.
1	Grease is the word.: I wanted to see Grease because I was in love with Olivia Newton-John. I watched it at a friend's house and loved it all the way through. Great music and great scenes all the way through. Who could forget the race at Thunder Road and the dance off? Of course, the really big scene that stands out in my mind is when Olivia walks up in the skin tight black jeans. What a knockout. The first type of video player I ever owned was the old SelectaVision videodisks that were popular in the early eighties and Grease was one of the first movies I ever owned. I've probably never watched-with the exception of Star Wars-a movie as many times as I've watched Grease. I'm guessing that I've probably watched it about 50 to 60 times all the way through. I can't imagine anyone not liking it.
0	Not what was promised: Original Review:I could never get the edition with the Leather Jacket as promised. After contacting Amazon 3 times and sending back the same version 2 times without a Leather Jacket I gave up. Even their customer service department said I would never get the correct selection.I guess what you see isn't always what you get. I'm sure the actual movie is fine. I haven't opened it yet as I assume it is new and shouldn't have any scratches. Maybe I should check that, too!Follow-up Review:Judy in Customer Service called me and said she made a special effort to track down a copy of Grease in a leather jacket for me and I could send them back the old one in exchange. She was very kind and I give her Kudos for being so involved. As promised, I got my Grease in the leather jacket and my husband is impressed with his gift! I would give this 5 stars now, but it wouldn't let me change it.
0	Dopey movie, bad message: "Grease" is a dopey movie, with silly jokes, innuendo, and fluffy songs. But this is only part of what is wrong with the movie. Worst of all is the message it sends: girls if you want to keep your boyfriend go lose on him. Sad that a movie like this is glorified so much.
0	DVD: The response was great and the shipping was great but the DVD was not in good shape. It fades in and out and is difficult to watch. But all and all it was ok.
1	Grease the Movie: Christmas present for my daughter. She will love it. Looks great, speddy service and I am sure she will enjoy this a lot. Thank you.
1	All movie preservation fans, do not get this movie in FS!: I warn you, they did not highly remaster the fullscreen version. i really recommend the widescreen. i bought the fullscreen version, since i own the ws version on video, so i thought that the fs version might look nice,... But oh well, grease on dvd in both formats is good. get the ws though.
1	screen vs. stage: I really do like this movie. I've seen it several times and the 5.1 stereo sound is more than wonderful. The acting is very very good and the talent from every actor is exceptional and i'm a big fan of everyone in this really great musical.But,,,,,the stage production is100 times better. For some reason the movie just went "to" Hollywood and it didn't have to. The Broadway version captured everything that it needed and all these extras were not really needed in the movie. Just once i wish Hollywood would take course101 in "Theatre." Maybe we could get better directors, better producers. Again the film is great but if you have a chance to ever see the Broadway version do yourself a favor. Then write me back and tell me what you thought. I know you'll be more than impressed. At least Michael Douglas from "Chorus Line" isn't in this. Never-the-less this DVD is still worth the price.
1	happy: The item came in plenty of time for christmas. very happy with the product. looks great works great. Awesome. Thanks
1	Shows the real deal: I like this movie because it portrays the true politics that went down when deciding who would break the color barrier in the major leagues. While I have nothing but the utmost respect for Jackie Robinson as a play and as a man, I know that Josh Gibson and Satchel Paige were arguably better choices if you were to just select the best ball player. This movie portrays how their shortcomings off the field prevented them from being that pioneer for Branch Rickey's Brooklyn Dodgers.
1	Second of two classic Christmas albums: Buck recorded two Christmas albums back in the sixties. While I agree with most people that the first, Christmas with Buck Owens, is the better of the two, I don't think there's much to choose between them.The set opens with the title track, a fun song about all the gifts that Buck has bought. This is followed by more Christmas cheer, with Christmas time is near and Jolly Christmas polka.Then Buck completely changes the mood with All I want for Christmas is my Daddy. The song avoids explaining why Daddy is missing but the sadness of the little boy that Buck sings about is very clear.After that song, the Christmas cheer returns for the remainder of the set, with Merry Christmas from our house to yours, Good old-fashioned country Christmas and many other interesting original songs.For country music fans who want to get away from all the obvious songs, this set is ideal. But if you haven't got Buck's other Christmas album, buy that too.
0	Limited: It is too small. It will barely accommodate a Chardonnay bottle, with no room for a cooling pack. It is too short for a Riesling bottle. Otherwise looks good.
0	a disappointment: Sort of like a sausage with a lot of ingredients thrown together but no mixture. leftovers from various artists all put in the same album. No coherence at all. Big band, small combosYes it's Stan Getz and Miles Davis, but it's NOT Stan Getz with Miles Davis. I would love to hear both of these artists playing together, that isn't what's on this CD. Probably their egos were so big they couldn't both be in the same room with each other.
1	rubbish: 4 GB is amazing and although mine did not work, amazon sent me a new one, How is that for service! UPDATE: The second one lost its firmware and all my input plus the computer does not recognise it. I bought it for audible and I now have13 months of books I cannot access.
1	I like it: I just bought this a few days ago. Everything is fine, but the battery seems so short. I charged it with an AC adapter from gomadic and I definitely don't get15 hours! I goes past the half way mark in about 3 hours and that is lame, but I do play around with it a lot. I also don't like the volume control. It's really hard to press and it should've just been part of the joystick.
0	Save your money: Save your money and buy an IPOD. This product doesn't even come close and Itunes is so much better to deal with. I sold mine on ebay.
1	Small Player, Great Value: The Creative Zen V is very small in size, but large in value. It has a great scratch resistant surface and packs in a very nice GUI and features. Sound quality is excellent.See my full review of this player here: http://www.epizenter.net/e107_plugins/content/content.php?content.21.1
0	okay at first...: So I got this as a christmas gift one year and was very happy with it. It's a great mp3 player with a good navigation menu (much better than a sansa or an iPod), good features, and great sound quality. It was all I just perfect for about the first year. Thats when the problems started. One day it froze up, but I reset it, no problem. About two months later it froze again. And again. And again. And again. Lately it won't even turn on long enough to hit the play button before it freezes. As one could imagine, it's completely useless now. I'm looking into replacing it with either a Sony Walkman or a Creative Zen (the new one, not a Zen V) and I hope whatever I decide on will be more reliable. Overall, I would not suggest this to anyone, because even though it seems great, the reliability of the software leaves something to be desired.
0	This is a really awkward peeler: It is very uncomfortable.Too thick to hold, too gentle too peel.More like a toy that an appliance.
1	Swivel Peeler: I used this peeler on some apples and found it to be the best one that I have ever used! It made preparing apples for applesauce and apple pies and crisps so much easier and faster.
1	I love this peeler: I owned another OXO peeler for about10 years, which is why I purchased this one. I can't believe how much better it is! It works very smoothly & rapidly. Has a great grip, even if different from the other. With this one, the peels actually come off very thinly... making it more healthy as it leaves more of the nutrients, a huge thumbs up!Actually, I was just going tp replace my lost veggie brush... I use it all the time, and it just disappeared! ack!
0	Frustrating, dulls quickly: I have used this peeler only a few times and it is already quite dull. It is now practically impossible to peel an apple with it, although on straight peels, like carrots, it still works like any other mediocre peeler. Also, the "swivel" never really worked well. It was always difficult to peel a curved surface like an apple with this thing.
0	bulky: The blade is good but the huge handle makes it hard to use. Someone with small hands would find this very unweildy. I bought this to replace an old peeler of similar design but with just a simple metal handle. I shall be going back to using that.
1	Cuts time in the kitchen: This peeler makes fast work of carrots and potatoes. I make a lot of carrot juice and was looking for a peeler that would cut my time down in the kitchen. This peeler fit the bill. Definitely a good bargain and easy to use.
1	A TRULY UNIQUE AND MEMORIBLE BOOK!!!: The Enchanted Castle was a great book with delightful characters that act out a memorible tale of magic, imagination, and mystery. My favorite picture in the book was the one of the children following the red string that is attached to the girl's finger. My favorite part in the book was when the girl claims that the ring makes it's wearer invisible, and then her fib becomes a reality. All in all, I think that this a book will be shared and passed down generation to generation
1	Very Good just like the rest of the Series: I really liked it, because almost all of my favorite characters were there. It was very dramatic and really pulls you in after the first couple of pages and you can't put in down because you want to know what happens to Bean, Petra and the rest of Ender's crew from the 3rd invasion. Both Bean and Petra come back but they are older and try tp fit back into their old lives where it seems they might not beable to. You meet Peter Wiggin(Locke) and the Parents of the Wiggin kids.
0	Why didn't somebody warn me?: You loved Ender's Game, right?And even though the next couple of Ender-related books were more confusing and not of the same quality as Ender's Game, at last came Ender's Shadow, the parallel story of Bean. Terrific.Then came Shadow of the Hegemon.It is, literally, a shadow of the original talent and quality of the first five books. The dialogue is tedious, the story line pencil thin, and the plot has a huge Achilles' heel (pun intended).This is another example of a book out by an author (in this case Orson Scott Card) who must have been pressured to produce, because this baby needs more cooking.It will make no sense if you haven't read Ender's Game and Ender's Shadow. It hardly makes any sense at all. Beware!
0	My Least Favorite Orson Scott Card Book: This was my least favorite Orson Scott Card book to date, by far. I've read all the Ender's Series, the Shadow series up to the end of Shadow Puppets, and the Empire series.I could barely finish this book; it grated me. If it were a movie, only 40 minutes of 4 hours was any good. The only reason I finished it was b/c it's essential to understand the next book in the series.-Finished on 2012-08-27 (116,804 words in 7 days;16,686 wpd).
1	Not Free SF Reader: Bean, the Brother, and the woman.Card continues to explore his Enderverse, and this time the story is set after the war, and on Earth as Bean and Peter become deeply involved in the politics and plots of the time.Nasty conspiracies for all.Not as good as some of the others, but still a good book.
0	didn't care about plot premise: I simply did not care what happened on earth in terms of political power. I care about Bean and his Jeesh. (For the record, where did this bizarre terminology come from--it wasn't in the Ender books, was it?) I want to understand how Bean is going to deal with the real world, as well as his classmates. I don't care who is in power on earth. And I thought the handling of Peter's parents was absurd! Plus, the killing of Sister Carlotta was a waste. How did Achilles become so powerful? There is no clear explanation for this. It was a bad book. I hope the final 2 are better. Perhaps Card is out of ideas...
1	Worthy of the Ender series: Was closer to the Enders Game, Enders Shadow style of books made it a very fun read, again dealing with the children. If your familiar with the Enders series, this story is about " Bean's" battle keeping piece and trying to save the battle school children.
0	Missing something: Never realized how much the The Real Wolrd benefits from having the hit songs of that time showcased in it. All those cheesy songs from the early 90's have been taken out of this edition, and replaced with really [bad] public serive announcement sounding music. This cast by far was the best, but even that doesn't carry the show with no real music behind them. Catch it in in reruns!!!!!!!
0	NO MUSIC???: I was about to purchase this DVD until I was informed that the original background music was taken out and replaced with something entirely different. Why?!? The first season DVD should have the original early 90's music, in which I love. So because it doesn't, I'm not buying the DVD. I'll consider buying this DVD set when the aforementioned mistake is corrected.
0	Who's idea was it to replace the original music?: I am interested in the Real World San Francisco (season 3) but when I watch it on the MTV website, some fool decided it was a good idea to change the music! Fire that fool and bring back the original songs. The music plays just a big a part in bringing back those great memories of the early 90s and MTV real world and for me....playing lots of tennis and then coming in to watch Real World. What a stupid idea to change the music......moron.
0	marie Claire Idees: I ordered this magazine and never recieved a single issue. I never got a response from my complaint.
0	Coastline and Inland...: I bought this CD hoping for peaceful shoreline sounds my infant could sleep to but was disappointed because after 20 minutes you don't hear the ocean at all; instead, it sounds like you're in the amazon listening to the local bird population. To be honest after hitting the "bird" section I always started the CD over and never found out if we return to the coast. If you are looking for authentic nature sound effects this is nice, but if you want a white noise wave CD you should find something else.
0	not in English: Not really a review, I'm sure it's a fine book. The Item is listed on Amazon as being in the English language, but it is in Arabic. Please be aware.
1	Nice, cheap product: I bought it for use with my Alias 2 phone. I needed the "L" jack because I wanted to put the phone in an arm band to listen to music while I worked out. I don't know if it is the phone or this jack (which is why I gave the 4 stars instead of 5) but if I have the jack plugged in all the way, I can only hear music out of one of my earbuds. I remedied this by wrapping a clear goody brand clear elastic around the jack so it doesn't go in all the way and I can hear out of both of the earbuds. The sound seems pretty good, and you can't beat the $3 for the adapter. Radio Shack wanted $10 for an adapter, and it wasn't even an "L" jack. I hope this helps!
0	Does not work with blackberry 2.5 mm interface: After the fact I now see some folks that sell this same product clarify it will not work with a Blackberry-- this amazon listing does not state that. I received it and it is mono (not stereo) unless you insert it only half way into blackberry and wiggle it. So be careful and confirm your particular phone's compatability with a 2.5/3.5 adapter,
0	Worse than a "b" movie: Not worth the time and trouble. Wondering how any one could have fallen for that babysitter. Try Angel Blue for something in this same vein that is really a good movie.
0	My donkey could make a better airsoft gun: If you ever encounter this gun dont buy it go out to eat or save the money for something better I'm beggin you. Its not durable the scope is a plastic tube and the laser donsen't line up dont buy it
1	Velvet Underground: This is the most underrated of all the velvet underground's albums and it just might be the best. Yes, its probably impossible to truely decide which one is the best because they are all fantastic, but this is a damn good one. Every song on the album is great. What Goes On is the most covered alternative song ever. Every alternative band that doesnt stink has covered it. Okay thats not true, but a lot of people cover it. Pale Blue Eyes is a mega classic, beginning to see the light rocks, its all good. This is one of the greatest albums of all time...blah blah. I was tired when I was writing this.
0	I would not buy from them again: I received Michael Kors Eau De Parfum 3.4 oz. It was wrapped in the box and looked new. However when I went to use it it leaked everytime I would spray it. Obviously it was tampered with- now I don't know what I'm spraying on myself. I will never buy from them again.
1	Well worth it!: When I first considered this product, I thought that having a corer was unnecessary. I don't like having gadgets that only do one task, but this product has made any apple preparation an absolute breeze. It makes it easier to eat healthy and avoid the seeds. OXO makes quality goods, and this is no exception. I am happy with this product and would recommend it to fellow apple lovers.
1	Gets the job done: This works as good as any corer should. You don't have to push down to hard to get the result you want. The hole is wide enough to get everything out. Great product.
1	Apple Corer: I bought this apple corer so I could core my apples more easily than with a knife. It works as advertised so I'm happy! :)
1	THIS ALBUM IS A COUNTRY CLASSIC!: Martina McBride's "The Time Has Come" is the best debut album ever. It is country in its purest forms. "The Time Has Come" is filled with awesome lyrics. My favorite tracks are: "The Time Has Come," "Cheap Whiskey," (with a message attached to it) "Walk that Line," "A Woman Knows," "True Blue Fool," "I Can't Sleep" and the album's strongest work is "That's Me" in my opinion. Martina McBride is an amazing singer!! This album is a great introduction to her craft. Make sure you add this cd to your collection!
0	Many problems: I've owned this watch (the black one) for about a year now. I did not purchase the foot pod accessory.The watch has on 4 occaisions gone 'all black' lighting up every pixel on the face. When this happens you have to do a 'reboot' holding all 4 buttons down simultaneously until the watch resets. Of course all your data needs to be reentered.THe watch has also mysteriously reset to March 24, 2005 on 4 or 5 occaisions (10am I think). The time and date are all messed up but it keeps your personal info.The problem appears to be on the RS200 only. Check out the posts on runnersworld for many, many more disatisfied customers before making a decision on this watch.
0	Very cheap product: I have owned older Polar hear rate monitors, my favorite was the S210. Is really cheaply made, belt is integrated into the watch, which is a very bad design, since the belt will be worn out with a year of usage. Overall, I think Polar products have gotten worse over the years. I am glad to see competitor like Garmin with much better products capturing the market they deserve.
1	groovy, swinging jazz: Recorded live at The Bohemian Caverns in Washington, D.C., "The 'In' Crowd" is The Ramsey Lewis Trio at the peak of their eclectic but popular sound. It has the intimacy and spontaneity of music recorded live, but the precision of music played by those who have talent. A bit bluesy, a bit groovy, swinging, boppy jazz. It's good music for driving, for cooking dinner, as background at a party, and, most importantly, for listening to. There is a generous selection of samples on this site. Try the title track...if you don't like it, you won't like this CD. But if you do, keep going with the Tennessee Waltz, Love Theme from Spartacus, or Come Sunday. I defy your toes not to tap, you to not at least add this to your wish list.
1	Recommended: While there were some rants that I didn't agree with, for the most part, I found myself agreeing to alot of what Maher had to say here. Written not long after 9/11 he has some great points about terrorism, national security and the way forward which, sadly, still ring true today (we've made a stunning lack of progress). It made me realize just how far we have to go.I recently read and reviewed America Alone (another book I really enjoyed, by conservative author Mark Steyn), which makes some of the same points that Maher, a liberal writer and pundit, makes in this book (which is to say the over-arching theme that too many Americans claim not to "do politics"). But both authors argue it's not (solely) about politics. It's about waking up, not believing everything you're sold in the media, doing your own fact-checking and becoming an educated citizen of the world. It's an obligation, not a demand on your free-time.Some crass remarks and language, but otherwise recommended.
0	Disappointing: We have only the paring knife from this set, and havebeen very disappointed with it. Our experience was almostidentical to that of Roy Sweeting, who has also reviewedit here. The knife lost its edge quickly, and worse yet,fell apart a few months after we bought it. The bladeseparated from the handle while cutting an apple.
0	Did Not Work: I picked the book up because I wanted to see if the author could pull this story off in a believable way. I think he missed the mark, at least with me. The characters where out of a bad1950's B movie and this lack of character depth plus the far fetched story did not get enough credibility with me. There are many other books out there that a much better, reread a Clancy if you can find nothing else.
0	THE "GRESH" who stole christmas: Almost every chapter tells you why the superhero is impossible. Gresh has no imagination in trying to figure out how future science may explain a superhero.If Gresh lived in the past, he would probably prove how electricity or flight is impossible or rockets or the internet. The original comics do a better job in explaining the heros.Dince Gresh likes cartoons better thean comic "That's all folks"
0	GET THE ORIGINAL HARRY POTTER SCORE!!!! ~NOT THIS!!!!~: I have had "The Sorcerer's Stone" and "The Chamber of Secrets" original soundtracks for a very long while. And when I was at the store one day I spotted this soundtrack... it looked different from the others I had, and I (being a huge Harry Potter fan) decided to get these CD's. Okay... BIG MISTAKE! I'm sorry, but this revision of the wonderful Harry Potter music from the original soundtracks is just horrible! It sounds like the whole CD was played on a keyboard and not with real orchestral instruments. And the songs seem to repeat themselves over and over again just to make the whole CD last longer.Peice of advice: Get the original soundtracks and not this!
0	A great bit part for Jackie Chan, but a TERRIBLE movie!: The only reason to watch this movie is a pretty good acting performance by Andy Lau, a beautifully choreographed scene between Andy and Jackie, Sammo in a decent role, and the great Jimmy Wang Yu (one armed boxer, one armed swordsman) in a bit part. I thought the ending was just ridiculously stupid as was the entire movie.The commentary makes sure you will watch the dvd twice, but THAT IS IT!!!!! Commentary is not very exciting or anything btu is pretty good and is actually a tad more enjoyable than the movie itself. The guy who directed the Best of the Best movies does it and tells some prettty good stories.
0	Yuck: Tiny Tim was in my opinion a very talented individual but his talent seems sorely lacking in this rather sad collection of Christmas songs. The less serious songs are fun and entertaining but the more traditional songs are about as enjoyable as a root canal without painkillers.If you want a Tiny Tim album get one of his better efforts such as Girl or the import God Bless Tiny Tim.
1	Thanks For The Memories: I used to watch I Spy when I was a kid and loved it. I sort of figured seeing it again after all of these years that it would be disapointing but I was pleasantly surprised by how well the show held up. Now, not every episode was a masterpiece but then again that's they way it is with all TV shows. When I was a kid I was sorry when NBC didn't renew the series for a 4th season ..... I'm still sorry.
0	Doesn't Quite Cut the Mustard: The story is a fun one...It's quick and easy for parents to read to their child before bedtime. The illustrations are fun and keep the child interested. But, for the money you're paying for the book, I would like to have more content presented. The story is cute, but less than imaginative. I purchased the story based on Newsweek's recommendation. I do not concur. This is a waste of money to purchase. Check it out from the library. Reading it once IS definately enough.
1	Great fun book!: I bought this book for my daughter in preschool and she loved it. My 6 year old grandson who has been held back in kindergarden read this book over Thanksgiving vacation with us that I gave him this book to take back home. He has read this book over and over to anyone who wants to listen to the story more than10 times. This book has open the door to reading. This Christmas he is getting other David Shannon's books. I want to thank this book in helping to open the door to reading. My grandson who had no interest in words,but now wants to read to all who will listen!Thank You for opening the door for reading with my grandson
1	Great product for the price: Easy installation and works great. The only thing that stops me from giving a 5 star rating is the base being square doesn't match the odd shpe of the base of my TV.
1	Favorite <3: This is definitely one of those books that I would pick up and read at least once a year because it has the perfect mix of innocence and idealism. I've read this over10 times and it still makes me go puppy eyed when my favorite couple are together~ Hands down, this is one of my favorite books of all time.
1	Anne of the Island: This third book of the series (Anne of Green Gables) is as good as the first and better than the second.
0	There was no Augustus Pelltier!: Creating historical fiction is a fine art. Where history is known, it should be respected. The opportunity for the historical fiction author should be to fill in the blanks with supposition and to tie together events for the flow of the story. Or, if the work is really a fiction, loosely tied to a real event, that should be made PERFECTLY CLEAR to the reader. This book fails to accomplish either of these goals. There was no person by the name of Augustus Pelltier who accompanied the Corps of Discovery to the Pacific and back. Too many children will wind up with a strangely warped view of this American saga. The tale is so full of adventure and excitement that it easily stands on its own. If the author desired the viewpoint of a young person as the main character, she could have used George Shannon, Sacagawea or Jean Baptiste Charbonneau, the youngest REAL members of the expedition. Reader beware!!!
0	Not too tempting to play again: The only reason I got this album is because that beautiful song, "Bittersweet" isn't available anywhere but on this import. The rest of the songs are a screechfest of constant high-pitched singing, and after 4 songs of the same, my nerves started to fray. Some of the other stuff is too Goth to be likable for my tastes.To be fair, "The Heart of Everything," their other album, is superior to this one. I enjoy hearing that one often.All in all, I instantly imagined Within Temptation to be the perfect music vehicle for any of Stephanie Meyer's vampire romances.
0	Needs a new singer: I gave this a 2 star rating because Sharon den Adel can not sing. This would be a perfect band if they found a new singer, this album is horrible with her. I thought she sounded decent on one song and she's not that great on the first album either. She sings off key all the time (especially when she starts singing high) and I have no idea why this got such a good rating.
1	Comfortable and stylish!: For the price, this is exactly what I wanted and needed. It is super comfortable and has just enough pockets for my computer, headphones, water and books.
1	Form your own opinion: this is my first time seeing this movie and I was blown away by the performances. Jeffrey Wright is an underrated actor, wish we could see more of him. when the movie came out, i think on hbo, there was a negative critique given to this movie from a magazine that I supported. because of the critique, i wouldn't give this movie the time of day. i must say how wrong they were!!! this is an excellent movie and i no longer go by the reviews of others, i form my own opinion. will definitely add this movie to my collection.
1	Best gloves you'll ever buy: these are the third pair of gel proframers ive bought. i am rough with my hands at work and have gone through other gloves in weeks, but i love the feel and the fit that the150's give the wearer. its like having another layer of skin but tough as nails. love this hand saving glove if you work with your hands ( I mean really work with your hands ) then these are the gloves for you...
0	A Waste of Time: The best thing I can say about this title is that it is better than nothing. These contracts are short and lacking in any real substance. Moreover, there is no analysis whatsoever regarding key contract provisions. Buy "This Business of Music" instead.
0	does not work for phone calls: The microphone howls as soon as the phone connects to thenetwork. Works great for games or radio.
1	Where did I miss this one?: I'm not sure how this work passed by me. Four classic Kingtales with numerous Dark Tower allusions, this is a must havefor all Stephen King fans. Its audio only, but the narrationis excellent. Sorry, no Frank Muller, but the reading is ofgreat talent.Someone help me out, when were these stories written? Are theynew, or recycled previously published as in Everythings Eventual.
0	Movie Mickey Blue Eyes DVD: Bought this movie because I like it, but it won't play in my DVD player. I was warned when I purchased it that it was region specific, however I thought it would play on Australian equipment. Very disappointed.
0	Waste of Popcorn: I saw this movie at the cinema. Having enjoyed other Hugh Grant flicks, I didn't expect this movie to be the total stinker it turned out to be. I thought Grant and Jeanne Triplehorn were a mis-matched couple. The acting was so-so, the plot very thin, and the humour strained. Overall, this movie wasn't worth the price we paid to see it, and I have no desire to ever watch it again.
0	ABC ? It must stands for "A very Bad book on C !": Contrary to what the title of this book implies, this is one of the worst book I've ever read, and I regret I bought the book. Let me tell you a story. As a college student I had some difficulties finding a good grip on C's complexities so I just did my best to pass the subject and forget all about C. Now as a professional, I must learn the language and searching for a book to teach me quickly, I UNFORTUNATELY stumbled on this book and after browsing through the pages, I was more confused than ever. The teaching style is TERRIBLE ! Alhough I learned a thing or two, it took me sometime, definitely NOT A TUTORIAL ! NOT FOR BEGINNERS ! For those wanting to learn C the SUREST and FASTEST way, I highly recommend "THE C PRIMER by Les Hancock and Morris Krieger". Kelley and Pohl maybe knows C, but they definitely do not know how to teach the language !
1	Get Read Great Information: This is a great book that you cannot put down. The author does an amazing job telling the story of Isadora's life and giving the picture of the importance of her work in its historical context. I learned so much about her life, her work and importance of it related to what we see as modern dance and theater.
0	Don't waste your money: I just bought 4 guitar christmas albums. I almost threw this out the window. Pure garbage. Do not waste your money on this.
1	Awesome!: This book is awesome! Although I have to admit, that some books are better, say "Rilla of Ingleside". I've recommended the "Anne" series to all my friends and they've promised me that they'd read it, for my sake. Even my librarian is as desperate as I am trying to find the rest of the books in the series. "Anne of Ingleside" has it's ups and downs but mostly it's all ups!
1	I found myself when I read this book.: This insightful, tender novel really touched on my feminine side. It is the story of the spunky Anne and her adventures in dealing with the twins, her school, and her best friends. Yes, I know, it is hard to be a16 year old male avid L.M. Montgomery fan, but without her books, I would never have realized the world of wonder attached to novels commonly thought of as "girl's literature."
0	The worst audiobook ever: We have listened to dozens of audiobooks and thoroughly enjoyed the experience but the stacatto, monotonous narrative style of Susan Omalley is the worst I have ever heard. A third grader could read this book better than she does. Do not buy this audiobook. You will only regret the purchase.
0	Self-Serving: Reading the book was slow and painful. I'm sure Arthur is a very nice man and honest, but did he have to go on for over 200 pages making that point. I think he wanted this book to be a learning experience for the reader, but unfortunately it turned into a self-serving narrative about the things he could not fix and his buddies.Maybe next time.
0	Too Little Too Late: First of all, readers will know most of the information in this book by reading the headlines in recent newspapers. The behind-the-scenes material is interesting, but it is so weighted in the author's favor that it lacks a sincere element of truth. Instead of writing a book about what investors don't know about Wall Street, I wish Arthur Levitt would have spilled the beans while he was the SEC's chairman. To make money by writing a book based on what he should have told investors long ago does not sit well with me. As an investor, I feel cheated and as a reader of this book I felt like the message was too little, too late!
0	A Sleep Aid: First, investors as a group are not going to take on Wall Street. The idea is unrealistic and the information in this book does not meet the muster of news anymore, because most of it has already been reported. The writing style is boring and slow to the point of sleep. I regret buying the book!
1	Drifting Away: The drifting music ofLaura (Fox Film Noir)melts us into the portrait of a murdered beauty. We are infatuated. Vincent price walks into the scene and all we see is his usual handsome, tall and most charming presence. Judith Anderson claims your attention as she did in another unforgettable movie "Rebecca." Laura is cool and ravishing.After all though, I was subdued by Clifton Web, as the splendidly audacious Waldo Lydecker. His words are choice and sautéed in lemon juice; a wonderful contrast to Laura. I must agree with him, when gum-chewing Detective Lieutenant Mark McPherson has become infatuated with the portrait of Laura, he sneers "Have you ever dreamed of Laura as you wife, sitting by your side at the policeman's ball or in the bleachers... or listening to the heroic story of how you got a silver shinbone from a battle with a gangster? (pauses) ...I see you have." Laura's image does not transform into a housewife.
1	Lovely Laura!: My daughter Laura suggested I try to locate a copy of this old film, informing me she'd never seen it. She enticed me to do a quick scramble to find "Laura" by saying we could watch it together when she visited during the holiday season. On Christmas night we treated ouselves to freshly popped popcorn, soda, individual boxes of candies, then dimmed the lights and watched "Laura" with our Laura! Was new to her; brought back memories for me!
1	Fantastic Film! Fantastic Seller!: This is a favorite of mine. I think most people would agree. The Amazon seller represented the product accurately. I wouldn't hesitate to purchase from them again.
1	By far, the best movie I've ever seen: This is a beautiful movie. The acting is beautiful. The cinematography is beautiful. The music is beautiful. Tim Roth is one of the most amazing actors, and his performance as1900 is absolutly astounding. I highly recommand you buy this wonderful film
1	The Legend of1900: The Legend of1900This is an Amazing movie! Fantastic music, incredible story, great acting and beautifully produced. Well worth watching.
1	Recieved in time Great movie: Love the Movie great story line good music kind of historical in a way back to the early part of the 20th Century
1	satisfied customer: I recently purchased a used video of, The Legend of1900. It was in perfect condition and was shipped on time and safely packaged. I will use Amazon in the future.
0	Didn't meet expectations: This book is OK at best. I was looking specifically for some guidance in process definition and had high expectations for this book, especially because it's published by Addison Wesley. Unfortunately, I really didn't get much out of it. There's one thing, however, that just about drove me batty -- Caputo spends a great deal of time developing "striking analogies to dance." I found this rather useless. As a typical software professional, am I expected to gain insight into the items being presented with the help of a comparison to an unusual profession? Analogies can be used to aid understanding when the analogy maps the new concept onto one the audience is already familiar with. The space taken to make the constant comparisons could have been better used to provide additional annecdotal evidence.
0	"Dude, Where's My Car" was better: Quite possibly the worst movie I have seen this year. It really was that bad. Lacking any character development, I felt no emotion towards any of the characters and considered turning it off half way through. This movie is a piece of garbage. It's got Sylvester Stallone in it and its out on dvd and it's a piece of garbage.
0	Release the Director's Cut: With Sylvester Stallone and Renny Harlin behind the wheel, you would expect "Driven" to be more entertaining than it actually is. The deleted scenes on the DVD give you a taste of what might have been. A "director's cut" is definitely in order.
0	Absolute junk!: Don't waste your money. Get the following movies...Le Mans: About as real as racing can get. Just wait until the end of the first lap and you hear the roar of the Porsche engine. It gives me chills just thinking of it.Grand Prix: Great cinematography! The melodramatic story can be a bit much, but the movie in widescreen is spectacular.Days of Thunder: Just plain fun. Not that accurate, but a fun movie...and it's a Bruckheimer!Don't even bother with Driven unless you can borrow it from a friend. Don't pay to watch this piece of unrealistic, hollywood shlock.
0	Okay but not cigar: First off I want to say that this movie was not all that it was hped up to be. My family has been involved in the racing business for many years now and this movie just stinks. The FXs are okay, but you do not hear of a car flying throught the air at a track crashing in a pond ,then exploding, and then having other drivers make a180 on the track and go back and help. This movie is a waste of your money. Save your money and go buy some beer and have a better time.
0	I watched this on a recommendation ......: Somebody recommended this wonderful piece of tripe to me as a good movie, and now I wish them bodily harm. The special effects were pretty good, but they don't save the outrageousness of the acts being commited in the movie. Add that to the lousy acting by just about everbody in the film, and you have a bonified loser of a movie. I wish I could give this movie negative stars.After watching this wonderful piece of garbage DVD, I watched the deleted scenes. It then made perfect sense to me why Stabone was in charge of the screenplay. He deleted any scene dipicting him as he was originally written, as a bad person. Stabone always has to play the hero. What an ego, somebody should call him and let him know that he's no longer "cool". Oh wait, was he ever?
1	Feel the wind.: A new star and a old star cooperate and get the top.A race scene is very exciting. Especially, driving on a public way is unblievable.Indeed, a story line is poor, but you must be satisfied only with the racing scenes.I think acting is good. You won't be disappointed.Thank you.
0	Stallone is Provolone -- CHEEZE -- BAD FOR THE SPORT: I have never been witness or had to sit through a more painful 88 minutes. I'm a racing fan, but this flick did nothing but denegrate the sport to the level of smut. Stallone clearly didn't have a knowledge of the sport nor did the director possess the intelligence to understand how to visually leverage the spectacle, technology and thrill that open-wheel racing delivers to fans around the world. It is an embarassement to the sport. They should ban these people from any race tracks.
0	Racing for Soap Opera fans: I did not like this movie at all. I thought that I might like it when I saw the previews. It was like a bad soap opera combined with a music video.
0	It's not "Rocky": Sly Stallone wrote this script, but he also wrote the script for Rocky. It wasn't a brilliant one, but at least Rocky was a much better film that this total waste of film.This movie has no redeeming qualities to it, I can't even think of one reason why I would recommend it. I thought it was boring, and the race car sequences were just okay.Stallone tried to throw romance(lame try) and action and sports together. I think he was trying to appeal to everyone, but I don't think it appeals to anyone. This movie was badly acted, and the script was awful(Rocky script was much better), and it has been done far too many times before.Skip it..and watch Rocky again.
0	ok movie, but the dvd skips: The movie is ok i guess it won't win any awards and story is very weak, but the race scenes are good but the movie skips I bought one and then took it back and exchanged it and skiped in the smane place i tried it in two players. Don't buy it it will skip and you may not as lucky as i was too get your money back after youve tried two dvds.
0	Drivel: I totally disagree with the opening statement that all racing movies are "clunkers"....despite their faults, Grand Prix and LeMans are classics for their riveting analog real time footage..but Driven? aside from some real time CART clips from the1999 season, the movie is totally preposterous, the special digital effects are ludricrous, the story is ridiculous, the acting is incredulous...this makes "Days of Thunder" look like "Lawrence of Arabia"!!....just watched it again the other day and it's only gotten worse...ouch!!
1	Easy to grip, easy to scoop: This is an easy to grip, sturdy scoop. The handle is cushioned, which helps you get a strong grip. The scoop is well-built and feels sturdy in your hand. Because of this, it makes scooping even the hardest ice cream a breeze!
0	FOR COLLECTORS ONLY: This1955 effort for Prestige is marred for me by vocalizing on 2 tracks and rather loud congo playing from Candido on several others. Fortunately Bennie and Charlie Rouse returned to the studio several years later and recorded BACK ON THE SCENE for Blue Note. It is much the better of the two and is included in the 3 CD box set which gives you 5 LPs worth of music,including SOUL STIRRIN--WALKIN AND TALKIN and more.
0	Fogless? Not quite: The mirror was in fact fogless for about 6 months, and I was satisfied. Now fogs immediately and is difficult to see in. I would have paid more for a product with a bit more longevity. Also feels flimsy, cheap.
0	just the pointed ends...: the tongs where hard to grip..so what I did to avoid sending them back.I took a pair of very small plyers and bent just the pointed ends inward..like a claw. Now they are excellent.grip great. love the long handle...and heavy duty soft rubber.hope this helps those of you like me who hate sending stuff back.
0	This Movie is SOOOOOOOOOOO overrated!!!!!!!!!!: This movie is SOOOOOOOOOO bad! By far, the most overrated movie of the 70's. What's the big deal? And how many times can you say "Shark attack! Get out of the water!" in five minutes? Well, find out when and IF you rent this crap, even though everyone of Earth has seen it already.They don't show the shark until 5 minutes to the end of the movie, either! Every time a scary or suspenseful part comes, it turns out to be a fish or something in the water, but not the shark.The sequels are the same exact thing, too. Just Roy what's-his-face in a boat looking for the shark, that Jaws 2. Jaws 3 is just a stupid attack on Marine SeaWorld by a shark looking for its babies and Jaws: The Revenge was actually pretty cool because that's the one you saw the shark the most and there's a lot of gore and action. If you're going to see any of these movies, see Jaws: The Revenge. DO NOT SEE THIS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0	Dolby Digital or DTS?: My receiver and DVD player are capable of both Dolby Digital Decoding and DTS. I want to find out which Jaws DVD to purchase, Dolby Digital or DTS? Please help!I am also curious about the Apollo13 DVD. Same Question, DD or DTS?Thank You - JimmyDuniay@aol.com
1	Jaws (The best film of our time): This is the best film of this generation, based upon the novel by author Peter Benchley and directed by the most successful director of our time, Steven Spielberg.When the small summer island resort town of Amity is set upon by a twenty-five foot man-eating great white shark, Chief of Police Martin Brody (Roy Scheider), an old shark hunter named Quint (Robert Shaw), and ichthyologist Matthew Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) set off on an uncharted, desperate quest to destroy the marauding killer embodying three tons of instantanious white death. A100% must-see classic from Universal Pictures. If you don't own this movie yet or haven't seen it quite yet (which I very highly doubt), watch this awesome thriller!
1	Jaws (30th Anniversary Edition): The movie was in excellent condition and I received it very quickly (just a few days after my order was placed).
1	My fav movie: This is my favorite movie because it's a shark eating people... this movie is scary enough to keep you out of the ocean. If you watch this on a BIG BIG BIG screen TV, it is AWESOME! My fav scene is when Jaws eats her way through the boat.
1	One of the best: Jaws is one of my favorite movies of all time, everything about it is fantastic. I can't recommend it enough if you haven't seen it, you definitely need to!
1	Solid Peeler: I purchased this peeler because my flimsy Victorionox $3 peeler's blade snapped right off. I received recommendation of this peeler being "the best peeler invented" by a fellow chef. I was not disappointed at all, the blade is sharp, the handle is comfortable and it flies through potatoes and carrots. I have even been told it lays waste to coconuts. If you're looking for a reasonably priced peeler, look no further.
0	A shame to kill so many innocent trees.: This book is flat out too long. The author's argument is simple. So simple, in fact, that this would have made an excellent journal article. Instead, the author drags it out, and drags, and drags, and drags and...you get the idea. Read the book reviews instead. You'll save yourself a few hours.
1	Have read for English102: This isn't my first choice type of book, but it's pretty good. Hard part trying figure out how to write research paper on it
1	Good reference material: This book was great for what I wanted it for, being a film student I felt it would be nice to have something to look back at anytime I forgot something when I am done with school. This book is a good source for a reference for refreshing your self or for learning something you didn't know!
0	Can anyone on the planet explain this CD???: Perhaps I am insane, but can anyone explain how any of these songs/titles have ANYTHING at all to do with either the book or the movie??I have gone to several sites & the same songs are listed with this album. I just don't get it. "who let the dogs out!!???"Can anyone explain how these songs have anything to do with John Williams or fantasy themes? One review on another site talked about John Williams being a big composer of fantasy themes, but it just doesn't fit. The sounds clips are the original versions of the songs. They aren't adapted to sound like fantasy type music. Has anyone found any sort of place that explains all of these songs or why they are on a CD with the words "Harry Potter?"...and what's with the Philosopher's stone instead of Sorcerer's Stone? Did I miss something or does the book have a different title in other parts of the world?Very perplexing.
1	The forgotten George Montgomery...at last!: Like many now past middle age, I grew up watching Westerns starring George Montgomery, Audie Murphy, Joel McCrea, and Randolph Scott. Montgomery's were not quite on the same level as the Scott and McCrea oaters, but they were always entertaining. CANYON RIVER is solid entertainment, good action sequences---no, THE SEARCHERS or RIDE THE HIGH COUNTRY it is NOT, but fun, nevertheless, and maybe a bit nostalgic. Recommended.
0	very light in content: The book is very light in content and written with a very narrow approach. If you want to learn anything about real estate don't buy this book.
0	Very disappointing product.: I thought buying OEM would be better than one of the clones. This battery isn't any better than the original battery that came with my phone 2 years ago. I don't use my phone much, but I'm having to recharge this battery every other day. I didn't make a good choice on this one.
1	SPANISH MADE EASY: After having formal Spanish in high school which was totally useless Spanish Step by Step was directed at people needing conversational spanish and not formal Spanish which noone speaks anyway. Great book for people needing to do a quick study for trips not to far in the future. Also for people needing to deal with Spanish speaking people in the job market or a business enviroment this book is a must!
0	Garbage: I also can't beleive Coleman would put out something like this. Blows cold air and now I will lose out on my shipping cost because I beleived in the Colman name and have to send back. It does nothing!! Well ,it does blow frosty air at you.
1	works great! but you need to read the directions...: Like the other users that have commented here, I was initially very disappointed. However, as I was grumbling and about to throw away the user guide, I decided to (gasp!) read it. Turns out the on/off switch is a 3 position switch, marked with 3 symbols: A Roman numeral I, A Roman numeral II, and a0 (Zero). So, I thought that zero was OFF, and number I would be LOW and number II would be HIGH. Turns out that number I is AIR ONLY and number II is AIR + HEAT. After trying it out on II, it was nice to discover a decent amount of heat coming out. I installed 3 of them on my daughter's Blazer, since there are three large pieces of rear glass that are always fogging up, and these 3 units perfom pretty well. Not hot enough to pose a fire hazard, but warm enough that after 5 minutes of operation, there is about a two foot circle of clear glass, and here in Alaska, that isn't too shabby.
0	Piece of Trash: This book "Doing Battle , The Making of a Skeptic" is really bad. Don't waste your money or your time. Borrow it from the library if you want to read it. I accidentally borrowed this book and another of his books "BAD or, the Dumbing of America" from the library at the same time. I was appalled at how bad both books were.
0	Broke in the first week: I bought this to help me open jars as I have tendonitis and have difficulty. While I was unsuccessfully trying to open a pickle jar, it slipped out of my hands, fell on the floor and broke.Give me the old fashioned kind any day.
0	Doesn't open everything: I love OXO products for the most part but this product just is not well designed. It does open larger jars but it is clumsy and difficult to use. My husband and I have arthritis and I was hoping this opener would open twist off soda or water bottles that always seem to give us trouble. The opening is way too big to accomplish that so, back it went to the supermarket. I had hopes this OXO product could solve our bottle opening problem but since it doesn't, I am rating this only one star.
1	What a relief, er, release!: Finally broke down and bought one of these gadgets after graduating to a hard cast on my hand for torn ligaments. The initial first use was tricky, but with careful patience, it worked great! And continues to do so. All the rubber grippers, etc. -- including from my arthritis doctor and the hand specialist -- are no longer cluttering my kitchen; this is the only tool I need. The man of the house also likes it, and it withstood his first use of manhandling just fine.
0	oxo good grips jar poor product: I previous had a similar jar opener and have 2 places and wanted to keep one in one place and the other in another. This jar opener is an inferior product and the worse thing I ever purchased from Amazon(and I purchased numerous things)It doesn't grips all jars and it should have advised me of what it was made of.It looked various similar to the other one I own and I can't wait till I can find another jar opener like the other one so I can throw this one in the garbage.
0	The third dimension is NOT terror... its stupidity!: THIS MOVIE SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This is not a worthy sequel to the legendary JAWS. It's stupid, the mechanical shark looks like a giant piranha, and its just boring. It's set in seaworld Florida. Whatever happened to Amity island?This peice of junk is pathetically unsuspenseful. Hello, where has John Williams got to? Not once did I hear the JAWS theme.The only good thing about this movie is the gore. That's it.A cheap waste of money. Oh, and by the way, I'm not even going to bother writing a review for JAWS revenge because its even rubbisher than this one!!!!!
0	A bomb: I loved the first 2 Jaws films. As a child I saw this one also and it scared me, I was in the video saw and decided to rent it. Definatly nott as scary as I remember there were quite a few laughs, unintentially I am sure. the 3D effects were just laughable I had a good time watching it but don't expect to to be horrified.
0	Not good at all...: This movie is so awful that you have to see it! The effects are really bad and they used very similar scenes from the original Jaws. Jaws 3 was way to long. The photography was so bad that you couldn't tall if someone was dead or alive. You had to guess. If you don't like blood, don't see this movie. Unlike Jaws and Jaws 2 this movie has the dead people on the screen for a fairly long period of time. After I saw it I was really embarrassed for the director, Joe Alves. The acting was alright, it was just the photography, the plot and the lack of the Jaws theme song (it was only used once) that made the movie so bad. However, I do think you should see it just so you can say you've seen all three Jaws movies.
0	A Toothless Sequel: The nicest thing I can say about "Jaws 3" is that it makes me appreciate Spielberg's original1975 classic even more. Everything about this movie is terrible, from the writing, to the acting, to the awful special effects. The movie drags endlessly, lacks any real excitement, and is poorly paced. What was Carl Gottlieb thinking when he co-wrote this film? And why would Louis Gossett, Jr. sign on to make a movie this bad right after his Oscar-winning role in "An Officer and A Gentleman?"Most of the visuals look cheesy, and the fact that the film is set in Sea World doesn't help. In the fifties, most 3-D movies were pretty bad, with only the 3-D gimmick to attract audiences, and "Jaws 3" is no better. Even its 3-D effects are weak. This is one of the most poorly conceived sequels I've ever seen. Perhaps if you're an avid "Jaws" fan, you may enjoy this somewhat. As a fan myself, it makes me wish I were watching the original "Jaws" instead.
0	Second Jaws sequel is dull but has some redeeming qualities.: The 2nd Jaws sequel is definetely not the worst, Jaws The Repulsive, I mean Jaws The Retarded, oops I MEAN JAWS THE REVENGE IS!!!!!!!! Jaws 3 has a great musical score, nifty plot, and a few dramatic moments, BUT... none of the characters are really engaging. You don't care about them as people so the movie is dull. Atleast the film is original. The plot centers around Brody's son Michael(Quaid) and his job at seaworld in Florida. Roy Sheider is sorely missed.
0	What a bunch of grapes!!!: First there was God, then Spielberg came along with Jaws...that's where it all should have ended. Jaws II was..not exactly bad but it wasn't that great either..Roy Scheider does a decent job and the shark...well..it's a shark.. But then came this one. I first saw it when I was a kid, and while the two first ones scared me, I laughed out loud after this one. Extremely bad special effects and above all a plot as thin as paper. Wow..a shark is in our backyard pool..how can we kill it..I know..let's go down in the water. Poorly equipped..DUH I'm sorry if I offend anyone who liked this poor sequel but I can't help but hate it.
0	IT DOESN'T WORK: I ordered Jaws 3 and I could only play Jaws the original. I was ripped off!! Don't order this unless you want Jaws1
0	Very, very bad: Where do I begin? This movie was awful...I had morning sickness that wasn't this bad.If being a "ham" were an Olympic event, Bess Armstrong and Louis Gossett, Jr. would sweep the gold medals for this ball of cheese. Dennis Quaid would pull a close second for his amazing performance as a caring boss and drinking buddy/older brother. (Has Dennis Quaid been in a movie in which drinking wasn't his main talent?)Anyway, go to the beach, but stay away from this video.
0	I'm amazed: Jaws1 was a great movie....Jaws 2 still felt like a jaws movie because all of the original characters are there except for of course Quint and Hooper...But I am amazed at the "good reviews" this movie is getting!! The plot is silly "MAMA IS MAD!!" and the horrible special effects...a shark swimming backwards?? Throw this in the recycle bin and hit delete...this movie was embarrasing!!
0	THE worst movie ever: I guess I have to give it a score! Terrible special effects and really bad acting.What were they thinking? A paper shark drawing by a 3-year old? Did the producers run out of money and couldn't come up with anything else?This movie is an insult to Spielberg who directed the original jaws.One star because I have to give something. Otherwise it will be -5 stars. Just terrible!
0	Worst Movie Ever Made: This was the worst movie ever created. I could have made better movies with crayons and glitter. Don't spend a dime buying this piece of garbage. I would rather watch paint dry than endure this swill. Thank God there is no Jaws 4.
0	Sucks Completly: Here is a perfect example of griding a story into the dirt. The acting and story line are so bad in this version, you'll wonder if this movie was really a cult classic in the making.
0	ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ: When this film came out I thought great. I always been an Arnold fan, but boy was I wrong. I wasted 6.50 on a real sleaper. The only guy who made the movie ok enough not to snore in the theater was the guy who played satan. From the numerous things that made this movie sad was the Bible ignorance. The taking out of scriptures was real bad.
1	First film Arnold Schwarzenegger did after his heart surgery.: Another good Arnold Schwarzenegger film. This time he plays a man who must fight the devil and win before the clock strikes midnite and it becomes the Year 2000. Not a blockbuster, but it will hold your attention. This was the first film Arnold Schwarzengger did after a two-year absence after having heart surgery. In the Bonus Materials section of this DVD, is "Spotlight On Location", a behind-the-scenes look of the film and why they cast who they did. A Feature Commentary with Director Peter Hyams is available. If you like to know the secrets of special effects, for example, was it a real train and how did it do that, all the secrets are revealed here of many special effects throughout the film. For those who have a bibical understanding, the entire "Book Of Revelation" from the Holy Bible is condensed and simplified here in its symbolic form.
1	VERY good movie.: Okay...this had to be one of Arnold's best movies, so therefore I'm going to buy it on DVD when it becomes available. There were some great scenes, especially the ending in the little underground chapel. But it seems weird...think of it. A Bunch of priests, and a whole on-line community? Oh well, its only a movie. There was however one REALLY upsetting scene involving Arnold's family..for those that hvae seen it, you know what I mean, that I, nor anybody else in the theatre erally enjoyed. It was too...bad. But this movie has great special effects, the story seems intact, and the cast lives up to the story as well. This is a must see movie.
0	TERRIBLE--RUN AWAY!: A complete waste of money, not even worth seeing. Not even worth one star--but Amazon.com doesn't give an option for no stars.
0	This movie was really bad...: Sorry, but I thought this movie was horrible. Only two other movies are on my list for horrible movies, and this is one of them. Schwarzenegger was completely mis-cast in this movie. The acting was horrible. I can't believe Gabriel Byrne wasted his time on this movie. Save your money and spend it on Stigmata. It is a much better movie...
0	Worst Schwarzenegger Movie Since Last Action Hero: This movie started OK and then degenerated into a bunch of Action/Horror cliches Which left me fast forwarding to the end. By the end of this movie you don't care if the good guy's win, or die.
0	Dont buy, rent if you really want to see it: While I did enjoyed the beginning of this, it soon got to the point that it was far to easy to guess everything about to happen, and I was fighting to stay awake watching it.Very sad also when the devil with all his powers, which he shows in the film, cant beat a drunk who wants to kill himself.One of the worst by Arnold.
1	most disturbing thing i ever saw: this film is the most disturbing thing i've ever seen. satan being in something is just gonna lead to foulness but this just went a little 2 far. arnold needs 2 re-team with james cameron for true lies 2 or terminator 3.
0	Unholy Mess: First of all, I had assumed the movie I was seeing was the film rendition of Dennis Daver's fine novel of the same name. Alas, it was a hokey, rambling, unrealistic journey about prophecies and the Catholic Church and a lot of mumbo jumbo psychobabble.Arnold was...well, Arnold. He can occasionally shine ("True Lies") but usually one gets a stilted, linguistically challenged portrayal of the same type character. In this he falls somewhere in between...as does the movie. You know from the first five minutes how it will end and while it is easily as good as most of the other tripe that passes for cinema these days, it is typical fare. Best time to see - when snowed in with nothing to do all day.
1	its hot: if you want to twerk that thang, this is the cd to get. the beats are really hot, and full of booty energy. lyrics are great, as long as you aren't into the rap thats for the mind.
0	Watch out for film deposits under the glass!: My six months old 4990 has a noticeable film deposits under the glass. The glass was clear when I bought it. Apparently other owners of the 4990 have had identicle problems (discussions at howtofixcomputers.com). Epson will clean it for free if the 4990 is still under warranty, but this is not a one time problem, but a continuous one (you have to pay Epson to clean the glass after warranty expires). The film is visible when the 4990 is powered up and the interior light is on. With the lid out of the way, look at the glass at10 to 30 degrees angle. I hope your glass is clear.
1	Epson minus Canon=New Top Of Line Scanner: With the discontinuation of Canon's popular and highly rated Canoscan 9950 F, the Epson 4990 is by default the new flatbed color scanner champ. I don't think I'm just going to wait while Canon gets around to coughing up a new and persumably better successor to the 9950 F. What arrogance! I'm switching to Epson today.Canon=STUPID.
1	Great Scanner, Even for the novice: Bought this scanner from amazon, and I can't express how happy I am with it. First ordered the scanner last saturday, and it arrived on Wed., this was with the free shipping. As for the scanner I have been playing around with slides, negative and older b/w photo's. No complaints, and some very nice scans. I like the ability to have a large scanning area. I have been placing multiple b/w photo's of different sizes in the film area, then individually crop the photo's. The digital ice has been very good on some of the pictures that have seen better days. I would highly recommend this scanner.
0	Lame, c-grade ACDC crap: Great cover, but that's it. Nothing electrifying or rising above decent and "nice try" status. Get the1st LP and continue with BREAKER on. A cute record if nothing else.
1	good solid album: If you like rainbow then you should like this one. Good production good songs great guitar playing. Not the best rainbow album but worth buying.
1	It worked: I am not one who believes in these types of things but a friend convinced me to give it a shot. We needed to sell a house relatively fast because we were moving out of state. Our house was on market 3 days and we accepted an offer @ asking price. I tend to think it was setting the price right, my friend believes old St Joe was at work. Regardless, <$10 and a little faith never hurts.
0	Arrived in poor condition: I purchased the St. Joseph home sale kit for a friend who has been struggling to sell her house. It wasn't an expensive gift but it was a gift nonetheless. However, the kit was shipped in an ordinary padded envelope and its little cardboard box didn't survive the rigors of the postal service. It was dented and smashed. In addition, the cardboard packaging looked like it had been exposed to moisture, it was slightly puffed in areas and looked old and used. Overall the kit that I received was not in gift-giving condition although the contents were unharmed. It was very disappointing.
0	Didn't work: I got this silly plastic statue because I had heard it brought good luck in selling houses. I knew it was just a wives tale, but I figured it couldn't hurt. It's cheap and it's plastic, but I wasn't expected much more then that based on the description. We were trying to sell our house in a hurry and it didn't happen for us as quickly as we needed it to. Granted, winter is not the best time to list a home...but if you are buying it for the hopes of 'helping' for a quick sale, save your money and just cross your fingers. (Or list it in the spring at a good price!)
1	This Fork is Good for a Dork: This cooking utensil is unlike any other. its intricate design is for the dumbest cooker or even a gormet french dude. Little do you know that this fork can be used as a stress reliever as well. say, for example, that your meat is not turning out well at all, infact it doesn't seem to look like meat anymore just crap, well with this fork you can whack the meat, stab it, and then hurl it across the yard and, trust me, you'll feel much better.
0	NOKIA BATTERY: I bought 2 units Nokia Lithium Ion1000mA Battery for Nokia 6300/8200 andreceived a Nokia BLB-3 that does not fot on the my cel phonesRegardsDavid Lebed
1	Great Value: I bought this looking to replace another thunderstorm CD that was just too loud and startling. At the price, I wasn't expecting much, but it's wonderful. Soothing waves, gentle thunder and no new age music.
1	The first of a line of fantastic records by the Jam: The amazing thing about this record is its deceptive simplicity. It has all the halmarks of punk, 3 chords and attitude, but it has deep intelligence, pop reference and lays the ground work for the true Jam materpieces such as Setting Sons and Sound Affects. It's1998 and I still listen to this great punk album in my car!
1	This is where it all started!: Weller18 a 60s obsessed mod teen takes speed sees the Pistols live and combines his love for soul and R&B with the fire of the who and the emerging punk scene. Is it a great record?- no but its a vital energetic youthful stab of music that would begin the career of the Uk's best songwriter youth icon. Plus there are some great tunes In the City Away from the numbers etc. This is a snapshot of London circa1977 and though never punk Weller was the essential rebel and no one looked better and more determined than Paul. The Jam were to become the essential British rock band outside of the Clash and weller has gone on to this very day to be one of the best songwriters of our Generation. And better still the Jams legacy is untarnished and still sounds refreshing today!!!
0	This Product SUCKS!: I threw them out! the most cheaply made piece c..p I ever had. Your feet have no support and the stuffing in the sole is like tissue so your feet remain cold
0	Out of subject: This book concentrates on c++, but it doesn't mention much about C++ Builder. I do not recomended it, if you want to learn Borland C++ Builder.
0	Poorly written but I find the subject thought provoking: I have read 6 of the 8 in the series, the author does a very good job of bringing the books and characters together. To a normal HS Educated reader that has served any time as a Grunt they will be slow but enjoyable. To the Elite it will be jibberish.
1	Good Read: Just falls short of being called a classic, but nevertheless an excellent read and gathers pace as one reaches the end. I found it very contemporary, almost everything "modern" is discussed or inferred to, be it drug use, incest, toy boys or sexual ambiguity. No wonder it still retains its freshness. I think this is a must read.Loved when the wife says that they can "fly" back to San Francisco - remember the story takes place in1932!! Lovely
1	Yes, You Can Judge an Album by Its Title (and Cover): A mesmeric work by an unlikely leader. Oliver Nelson hadn't recorded anything that hinted at this achievement, and he didn't near it again. This may be Freddie Hubbard's finest moment, and Bill Evans and Paul Chambers are surpassing. The compositions are complex and accessible. As a special bonus, this edition has the strikingly original original cover art title, and the record is aptly and eloquently titled.
0	Having it both ways: As a translator I can sympathize with Gass' approach. He gets to fault all the other translators (this writer included)while also, implicitly and explicitly, celebrating his own results. But despite this rhetorical cunning, Gass, who is a fine essayist and novelist, does not have a poet's ear, and again and again his versions fall short of effective poetry. They must stand by themselves, ultimately, and while he does his utmost to justify them, they tend to reveal why he needs special pleading to put them before us as supposedly superior to other versions. Mine, from the mid-seventies, first published in FIELD and now available from Norton, have reached a wide public without this kind of explaining, carping, and denigration of the efforts of others.
0	Lots of stains not listed: I was very disappointed with this book. I saw it on Oprah and thought that I had to have it because I'm not very good with laundry. It turns out that every time I've referenced it, the stain I'm looking to treat isn't included. For instance, GRASS STAINS! Where is that??? Anyone who has children would look for this first, yet it's not even in there. There are many common stains that aren't even listed. I wouldn't recommend this book; and I'm surprised that Oprah did.
1	VERY EXCITING MOVIE: I thought this was a really good movie. The woman was very beautiul. I got excited watching her.I felt sorry for the man though.
0	YeePee...PORN with a PLOT ! ! !: *BASIC INSTINCT: Unrated Director's Cut*Wow, I don't remember this movie being so pornographic. I guess the Director's Cut, with the extra 5 minutes, is nothing more than extra porn. I remember it's what made Sharon Stone so popular? This would have made her a legend if it was released this way. From graphic oral sex(Michael on Sharon) to a near rape scene, this movie is just too much for me. The main story is great, with a great twist for an ending(or non-twist, depending on how you look at it) however, the graphic sex-scenes are just not neccessary and are way too overboard(I can't help but wonder if Sharon Stone and Michael Douglas are still proud of their work on this film?).Go ahead and call me prude, but I cannot recommend this filthy trash.
0	What is this?: In the city I live in, such a noisy fuss was made about it that many people including myself went to see what caused such excitement. Indeed the fuss-makers should pay me what I paid for the ticket, as the story is no different from any ordinary paperback. Amazing to see some guys writing comments in this column admire Sharon Stone as if they have never seen a naked woman on screen before. Garbage movie, and the ones that think this one deserves to get five stars are completely unaware of the meaning of ''entertainment''.IT DOES NOT DESERVE A STAR AT ALL - I COULD GIVE IT A MINUS.
0	It's a shame: Poor Kirk Douglas ! His son Michael f## up any movie he plays in... And Sharon Stone is said to have the highest I.Q. in Hollywood. That is NOT proven at all by being in this lousy movie.May I remind you that Hollywood does not exist only since the 90s but back to the 40s 50s and 60s there are hundreds of MASTERPIECES you haven't even heard of -watch them and get smart instead of losing your time with violent artless movies
1	Underrated: Yes it is famous for the sex. But really, Paul Verhoeven has created an excellent modern Hitchcock yarn. Cheesy at times and overdone at others nevertheless Verhoeven and his cameraman Jan de Bont have done really great things. Steady cam work is brilliant and the dance club scene pulses with more energy and sexuality than any of the nudity crammed scenes in the film. Overlook the surface and you'll find a layered film made with great skill.
0	Very Poor Quality DVD Mastering: I doubt that Artisan even bothered to remaster this DVD release -- it looks like it was either1) taken directly from the Laserdisc master or (and most likely) 2) taken from a general release print (not the original print) of the movie. What a shame -- Artisan usually produces some great DVD packages, but not this time. Save your . . . money. . . and wait until a better DVD transfer hits the shelves...
0	Learn how to make your own reeds.: I played the bassoon in high school and purchased Jones reeds from a local music shop.1 of10 reeds I purchased were made properly. Not only did I spend a lot of money buying bad reeds, but it became frustrating playing the bassoon. I later found a professional bassoonist who provided me with handmade reeds and the majority of the issues w/ intonation I had were eliminated.These reeds are fine - I suppose- while you're learning the notes on a bassoon, but that's about it.
1	A Real Gem: While Lari White's debut CD, Lead Me Not, did not make much of an impression on me(poor song selection, not her voice) she sure hit it out of the park with her follow-up, Wishes. The title song is, of course, stunning and Ms. White can sure push all ones buttons with her emotional delivery. This is one of those CDs you put in the player and just let it play as there are no clunkers to be found here. My favorite track is That's How You Know (When You're In Love), a glorious duet with Hal Ketchum, another singer we hear far too little from. If you only have one Lari White CD in your collection, it should be this one!!
1	Grateful Dead's Rough Blues debut with a hint of psychadelia: This is the first Grateful Dead album and was released on March17,1967. This was right when the Grateful Dead started to play psychadelic music which would later be showcased in their acid rock masterpiece Anthem of the Sun a year later. I think this is a pretty underrated album and it is a good showcase, especially with a live version of their first open-ended jam song which would sow the seeds for Dark Star, Viola Lee Blues.Since this is very different from their later albums, it is very special and I would say it isn't a very good intro but if you are getting into the Dead, I say welcome friend.
1	OXO Good Grips 28381 Corn Holders: A very good product, much better than the usuall ones that break after a few uses.
0	very average: the disc starts off on a groove then it goes down hill.the vibe is lost and never picks back up again.The 5 year lay-off seems to have had a Impact on Miles.he was Hit&miss through out the 80's.The Funk of the 70's was Drowned out by the Synth&drum Machines of the 80's.
0	P. Kilmos is right: All10 of the songs come from Stone Cold Rhymin', and the CD doesn't even take the best10 songs from the album. This CD is an absolute waste of money. Get Stone Cold Rhymin' instead.
0	too expensive for what you get.: This product provides just10 feet of track and a car for $30 dollars. It should cost $5. Do not buy, as it is simply too expensive. $30 should get at least100 feet of track.
0	Not what I had in mind when i ordered it: The spreader is much larger and wider than I wanted. I have found it useless for buttering bread sticks, which is why it was ordered.This is my fault and not that of the spreader.
1	Lift-the-Flap Fun!: "Lift-the-Flap Fun""Who sits on the potty?" Not the zebra! Not the sheep! Not the giraffe! Not even Sara - at least, not at first. With simply drawn illustrations in soft colors and flaps that lift to reveal the answers, your toddler is sure to adore this potty book. After reading over two dozen picture books on toilet training, we liked Sara's Potty because it was entertaining and educational. The wide, square flaps are more durable than the smaller slide-the-arrow variety featured in other similar activity books such as What Do You Do With A Potty? by Marianne Borgardt and Let's Go Potty by Moira Butterfield (but these books are also worth a look). Harriet Ziefert's story identifies the purpose of the potty ("pooping" and "peeing"), includes the often-omitted handwashing step, and shows the transition to "big girl underwear."
1	gets the job done: before this i used another RCA cable - whenever my computer shifted even in the slightest, the stereo would completely fuzz out with an unbearable sound. this cable is completely sturdy. i can jostle all i like, and the sound stays constant. a good buy in my opinion.
1	Creepily good: Since I tend to steer away from thrillers in general, I am not likely to say I've seen this plot before, which appears to be the major criticism provided by most of the posters. My spouse is a huge SB fan, and we are catching up on her movies that we somehow missed, or those we want to see again. Bullock is convincing and riveting as a damaged cop. The two young boys are absolutely chilling. Ben Chaplin is adequate. My major problem is with the police department's eagerness to wrap up the case, and the way Cassie's boss treats her when she is not satisfied with the way the case is initially closed. If she is so bad at her job that her boss won't even recognize her instincts, why does he even keep her on the force? I found his treatment to be demeaning and unrealistic. Other than that, this was a fine Bullock movie (certainly better than most of her "serious" efforts), and I would call it a worthy addition to the genre.
0	Great Irony: My favorite thing about "Murder by Numbers" was the irony: The very thing the guilty boys were doing to mislead the police-red herring after red herring-was the very thing the producers/directors of the movie were doing to mislead the viewers into thinking they were watching a good movie.
0	Warmed-over TV thriller: Slightly more interesting than your average made-for-TV thriller playing on cable stations Saturday afternoons, Murder By Numbers has a lot of interesting scenarios that end up clashing with each other in a the big, unappetizing stew that is this movie. Only recommended for huge Sandra Bullock fans.
0	Too many negative interpretations: This dream dictionary,more than any other I've has more of a pesemistic outlook for the querent than most dictionaries. Perhaps the gloomy images are just a reflection of the days in which the book was written (1940's?) I won't knock the book completely because no other dream dictionary offers as many dream inter- pretations as this one. One does get their money's worth if that if quanity of dreams is the main qualifier. Myself, I do use the book on occasion and still enjoy it somewhat, but remember, many of today's common symbols like computers,televisions and other hi-tech symbols aren't listed.This is why I give the10,000 dreams a score of 2 out of 5.
1	Really tells the meanings of my dreams,fun for the family: If your'e looking for a book that tells the truth about your dreams,this isn't the book for you.But,I think it is''really'' fun to read the myths that they put in there and if one of your dreams will give you misfortune or constant luck in the future.So what i'm trying to say is ''This is a really good book and i would definately recommend this book to dream lovers all around the world!!''
1	Best can opener I,ve used: This can opener is easy on the hands, having a nice comfortable handhold and grip.It also bites into the can and cuts around the lip in a nice even action, no jerking.I,m not an engineer but this one looks much better made than others I have used.
1	Everyone needs one.: For what it is, it's perfect! Every kitchen and emergency supply kit should have a manual can opener. The old kind, without all the ergonomics and padding, were uncomfortable to use; this one's a breeze. It arrived within10 days of ordering, and is exactly as advertised.
1	Dillin's "The Kentucky Rifle" is Definitive: Originaly published in the '20's, Capt. Dillin's history and illumination of the classic American longarm is the definitive work on the subject and serves as the primary reference for later works, such as those by Kindig, Shumway, Petersen, Buchele, Lindsay and others. Researched and written at a time when some of the last of the area gunmakers were still alive, his work is thoughtful, well-research and replete with examples, anecdotes and photos. No arms library is complete without this book. If you are at all interested in the Kentucky or Pennsylvania rifle, you will read every page.
0	Way too slow and cheesy: I just recently watched this film and found it very boring and extremely fake. The acting was basically non-existent and it seems that every bloke in this film is only out to get into the lead ladies pants. The only appealing feature of this film was the nude scenes.
0	The missing piece: As a previous reviewer pointed out, something WAS missing in this book and I think I found it. Integrity. The frustration you feel on behalf of the lead Kaylie is every woman's nightmare of feeling trapped and helpless in a situation you have no control over. She is accosted in her own home by the zealous bounty hunter Sam McKade, mistaken to be her twin sister, molested when she claims she is NOT the one, and then dragged across the country against her will. The fact that Sam is supposed to be a professional only makes Kaylie's plight worse in that he doesn't do anything conclusive to find out if she's really who she says she is. Read the blurb and take the book as you will. Some parts are entertaining but others are degrading.
0	Flat characters. Boring Story. Mediocre writing.: I'm not very demanding of my books. I just want a fun story with fun characters. This book failed to deliver either. The characters stuck to every stereotype. The actions and reactions were unbelievable. My first and last Susan Andersen book.
1	Fun and sexy romance: This fun read had everything needed to make it a good romance. The hero and heroine were both very likable characters with a lot of fun banter. I liked the premise of the story; having the twin sister mistakenly rounded up by a bounty hunter was a fun and entertaining plot. The story had the right mixture of action,enjoyable dialog and romance to make me a new fan of this author. This was only the second book I've read by her but will certainly read more. The side plot with the twin sister was also a fun and enjoyable addition.
0	fuentes: i was unaware that this was an instructors edition and was very upset when i received it. i was not searching for an instructors edition, and no where in the text did it state the book as that...
0	Overhyped without much substance: Like many readers, I bought this book with high expectations based on the overwhelming claims it was so good. I hope to save others from my fate. Don't believe the "reviews" here that call this book a masterpiece or a classic. This book is terrible! Where are the honest reviews of this book?King's writing is dreadful, at times it seems English is his second language. His reuses the same or similar phrases. He uses many unnecessary modifiers. He adds extraneous words for filler. The dialogue rings false almost in its entirety. To make matters worse, the story is derivative and cliche. This concept of a child discovering that he or she is a wizard has been done to death already.I know it's a matter of taste, but nearly anything would be better than this.
0	Typical white-male misogyny: A man I met (purely by accident) suggested I purchase this CD - so I thought I'd try it. I guess the joke was on me. I mean, this was more of the same-old, except taken to the extreeeeem! These "men" think they are God's gift, the whole time putting down anything without a10" "love prong" Who do they think they're fooling? These are scared little boys - with large guitars (and that's about it). "Working" on a Sex-Farm? I'm sorry but I (nor any woman I know) wants to be "plowed like a bean-field" or "stuck with [his] pitch-fork"!!! I even heard (the usually acceptable) Rob Riener made a movie about these perverts! Is the whole male world going crazy?
0	Sequins, swearing and silliness: Barney meets the Godfather. Lots of violence and cussing but nothing interesting. It's a kids' show with the Irish Mafia (huh?) thrown in. But don't take your kids -- it's very violent.Obviously, I don't recommend it!
0	Horrid Film: This is still to this day one of the most awful films i ever saw. I took a girl on a date for this movie and wow, what a mistake. The movie has no real plot and just gets worse as you watch it more.
0	EEWWW that smell!: The worst movie ever? This movie is marketed as being a "Barney" bashing movie, for all those parents fed up with having to endure endless hours of mindless childrens videos. But instead of biting sarcasm and rampant deviltry, the viewer is subjected to endless full-blown musical numbers written for children. Watching this movie was like watching 2 hours of Barney videos. Instead of treating children's icons like pinatas, this movie is an homage to them. The script was written for children. It completely lacks adult humor, and any humor at any level period. The lone exception is one scene by robin Williams, where he slams into a brick wall during a spoof of Singing in the Rain. I was stunned that there were no other laughs in a movie with such a great comedian.If you haven't had enough of Barney then this movie is for you.
1	One of my favorite movies of last year.: Every single person I know loved this movie. From the songs (I will find the soundtrack some day) to the great character acting, this movie is one of the best I saw all last year. No it's not a movie for kids, I but I firmly believe that if something is rated R kids shouldn't see it anyway. But to all the adults out there...this movie is wonderful.
1	"uh...uh...it's a rocket!": "Death to Smoochy" is laugh-out-loud hilarious! Robin Williams and Edward Norton were GREAT. The whole concept? No one puts Rainbow Randolph out of work! DIE SMOOCHY DIE!! I recommend this film to everyone (even if you're not fond of dark comedies).Totally original and brilliantly directed by Danny DeVito, "Death to Smoochy" has become one of my favorites!
0	A Total Piece of You-Know-What: This is definitely one of the WORST pieces of rubbish I have ever seen. Robin Williams and Edward Norton are EXCELLENT actors, so why they decided to participate in creating something so dull, plotless, stupid, and inane is beyond me.I desperately tried to figure out the plot to this, but I realized I couldn't because a plot simply does NOT exist. This movie is trying to come across as a quirky, off-the-wall comedy, but it's one big emotionless yawn. No laughs, no tears, no interest, no smiles, no frowns. I sat with a blank expression on my face the ENTIRE time.Take my advice - do NOT, by any means, buy this movie. It is honestly one of the worst pieces of film ever created.
0	It's junk: The workmanship and quality is second rate. The handle is the only nice thing about the zester. The steel is literally junk.
0	Dull Channnel Knife: I purchased the OXO lemon zester specifically for the purpose of making long lemon garnishes for martinis and other beverages. It worked tolerably well the very first time but after that the channel knife was too dull to work at all. Was very disappointed.OXO Good Grips Lemon Zester. Am looking for a proper channel knife and would welcome suggestions.
0	Edited, not at ALL what I wanted: This video was EDITED, and the seller should've listed it as such, and I wouldn't have purchsed it. I contacted the seller, and received no response. They should tell you that it is NOT the full version. My favorite scene was NOT on this video, so I was very disappointed.
0	Alice Lackluster: Don't know to whom this would appeal.Fine actors wasted on this attempt to breathe new life into a wonderful Victorian Era story. Nothing like the Wizard of Oz for fantasy and visual excitement. Young viewers I showed this to were immediately bored with its pseudo intellectualisms even an adult would tire of.
0	THE METAL RIPPED?: Imagine my suprise when after less than a year of use, the metal grid broke, bending outward while pressing a clove of garlic. Very dissapointing. And while my hands never slipped of the "non-slip grip" the grips themselfs often (every use) slipped down on the metal handles. I think I'll try another brand this time!
0	I wouldn't buy it again...: I bought this garlic press about 5 years ago. It has done a good job for the past 5 years, but a month ago it broke on me. I didn't do anything extraordinary. I was just using the press like normal and the hinge broke. Also, the black rubber handles slide back and forth allowing water to get into the handles
0	Mine broke, too!: Great features (the comfortable grips and self-cleaning) but it is not durable at all. Hinge broke while crushing a small clove of garlic and the press was less than 3 months old! Certainly not overused nor abused by any means. Even hand-washed despite the fact they say it's dishwasher safe.The press "looks" like good quality stainless steel but I've never seen stainless "snap" like this one did. I know of two other family members whose OXO presses broke at the hinge, too.So, I will not be wasting my money on this brand. I'll go with a true stainless steel press until this manufacturer can improve on this one.
0	OXOs stuff is generally quite good, but this is an exception: Overall, I've been very impressed with OXO tools. However, I have to say that this garlic press is a notable exception. It's just not built to withstand any kind of heavy use. If you put any medium or large-sized clove of garlic in it, you will break the press, it's only a matter of time. I've gone through 2 of them this way, and it's a shame, because generally OXO tools hold up much better than this.
0	Ours snapped: Ours snapped, under normal use -- not at the hinge, but on the shaft connecting the handle to the sieve half of the press. You wouldn't think a thick stainless steel shaft could snap under hand pressure. And probably it couldn't. But this press is not made of stainless steel. Once it snapped, we could see that it was made of some kind of semi-porous composite material with a chrome finish that makes it look like solid metal.
0	Broke in less than 3 months: Trust the other reviews. Mine broke just like the rest.Pros (before it broke) -- +4 stars.* Comfortable* Worked well (including the rubber bristle for cleaning the press)Cons -- -3 stars.* It broke in less than 3 months. Head area snapped off.Overall:1 star...
0	Went back to OXO twice -- made from weak metal: Although this is a nice looking product, and it lives up to the 'good grip' promise, I went back to the company twice for a new one after the metal broke apart at the stress point (the hinge).I will say that OXO stood behind their product, shipping out a new one with no fuss. But after getting two replacements, and seeing the third break in exactly the same place, I'm done.
0	Not for those who are serious about garlic: If you put a large clove in this one, you will be hard pressed (ha, ha) to squeeze it through unless you have large, strong hands. Mine ended up in the trash after one of the handles snapped clean off.
1	Works great, but breaks: I've been very happy with my OXO Garlic Press over the 5 or so years I've used it. The problem is that over time, the metal hinge wears out and eventually breaks, leaving the press useless. I've had this happen with two different OXO garlic presses, so I know it wasn't just a bad batch. I did use it fairly often, so maybe that just comes with the territory. For the third try, I'm going to try the Zyliss Susi press instead.
0	Bad recipes: This is a lovely, cheerfully written cookbook, and only one recipe I have prepared from it has been any good. The rest are boring and flavorless. I love casseroles, but I've finally given up on this book.Update11/12/2007: OK, so I didn't give up. I just made the San Antonio Chili Casserole. Sounded good: chili with a cornbread topping. Did he leave out ingredients for the cornbread or what? Butter and eggs and nothing else? Added some buttermilk, and although the chili wasn't terrible -- standard beans (lots of beans) and ground beef -- the recipe had to be tweaked too much to call it a success. Get some Junior League or community church cookbook if you want these recipes -- anything!Update01/26/2009: OK, because I am a masochist (and apparently a sadist to my family), I tried one more recipe (Mamie's Ham and Black-Eyed Pea Supper), and I now plan to permanently delete anything by Mr. Villas from my recipe file. You have been warned.
1	Wonderful Performances of Bluegrass Standards: This CD, just like Volume1, has it all - astonishing and soulful picking, extraordinary harmony singing, and a good choice of songs. There's something wonderful to be found in just about every cut. Some of my favorites: J.D. Crowe's banjo solo in "Molly and Tenbrooks", the harmonies and vocal counterpoint in "So Happy I'll Be", and Jerry Douglas's licks in "Big Spike Hammer". Somebody else could pick three others, though, and I probably wouldn't disagree with him. Bluegrass doesn't get any better than this.
1	I'm in LOVE: A great mix of styles and great vocals.I recently discovered this CD and was not dissapointed.A must get!
0	Spend a little more to get a lot better: I LOVE OXO products. I think they are some of the best designed kitchen tools on the market. I started using OXO knives when I found a 6" utility knife. That is a great knife. OXO makes many other great/good knives but this one is not worth the money. I was very excided to use it for the first time and when I did I noticed that the blade was flimsy, it was more like cutting with a sharp piece of sheet metal rather than using a sturdy knife. I would recommend spending a little more and getting a better knife.
0	DRAB: I found this book to be one of the poorer encounters of the Risorgimento. It certainly didn't grab my attention. She provides a lot of detail..perhaps too much but fails to draw the attention of the audience. I would suggest another book on the Risorgimento over Riall's account such as Derek Beales.
0	not what I expected: I bought this for my daughter-in-law to help her find God's purpose in her life as she goes through this difficult time. What this book does is teach New Age theology and is not Biblical, and the author names her "god" Universe. I returned the book.
1	Japanese anime(moving manga) is good translation.: Lucki sta(Lucky Star) is a high school ladies stories.There are no important things in the stories.But it is well presented Japanese high school days.People call a person without Mr. and Ms.Instead of Mr. or Ms., chan or san are used after the name.It is explained in the notes in the package.In japanese, speaking is a little slow.But English version is a little fast.That is the main difference in Japanese version and English version.Best Regards.
0	Useless, Horrible, and Filled with Typos!: This book was filled with an unbelievable number of mistakes. On every test, it always gives wrong line numbers and misspells many, many, many words. Often (a few times a page) it forgets to leave spaces between words. There are no tables to convert your sample tests into SAT scores. And to top it off, the answer guide is often wrong. This was the worst $10 that I have ever spent. Save yourself money, don't buy this horrible book!
0	Cute but not quality: The material this is made of just does not hold up when thrown in a purse all the time. The material frays all over the place and looked tacky within a month or two. I did not contact the manufacturer (I guess I should have) and just threw it in a bag for Goodwill. I would not recommend this for others!
0	problems with the display: After about a week, parts of the numbers on the display were no longer visible. I'll try to get it replaced. Let's see what happens next.
1	long knife: this story shows how the efforts of "george rogers clark" contributed to the growth of this country. we are used to hearing about the exploits of the revolutionary war but not often do we get a chance to know what was going on in the northwest territory. this is one of the best books i have ever read that covers how important a part was played by what was happening there. i recommend this book as an excellent read and most informative.
0	Couldn't keep me interested . . .: I have read several historical books in the past year. My dissappointment in this book stems from the fact that it spent too much time in the early going describing General Rogers' physique and general superhero status. I quickly lost interest in the subject. Still, I am interested enough in the subject and the historical time period that I may seek out other relevant books. My first reading experience with a James Alexander Thom book was, unfortunately, not a good one.
1	Exactly as advertised!: A delightful series of tales From the Land of Barely There, by Stephen Cosgrove...He tellls storys for little ones that teach them important life-lessons in a great way that kids can really relate to..
0	Wanna buy mine??: I bought this DVD after trying Turbo Jam off of Beach Body (cause I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE Turbo Jam!!) thinking this might be just as good....boy, was I wrong!! I have taken a couple of yoga classes and this video was SUPER cheesy - nothing like real yoga!! I really wish that I would have been able to sample a little video clip of it on the internet before purchasing. I think it was a waste of money. I wouldn't recommend it.
0	Not an iota of authenticity: If you are looking for a Yoga, Ballet and yes, even booty-licious workout, I recommend you buy three different workouts instead of YBB. Yogis are literally rolling over in their graves at these ladies. This is so typical nowadays, to find irreverence in everything. I would suggest renting this before buying. I rented and am so glad I did. My eyes were rolling the whole time and many of the cardio "booty" workouts are just awful--literally ridiculous. The changes they make to moves and the speed they start at in the intro video might actually injure someone less limber. There are way better videos out there, for less money too--these ladies just have better marketing behind them.
1	Great memories: I was lucky enough to see this great play on broadway many years ago and owned the LP. Needed to upgrade my music collection to more modern times (AKA CD) The story is still so true in today's society so the music was still very enjoyable. We lost a great composer and singer with the passing of Anthony Newley.
1	This is a difficult book but a good book.: I learned that wolves communicate and have territories and there are no-wolf zones. I never knew that people could talk to wolves.
0	Interesting but buggy: And I mean "buggy" as in this piece of software will suddenly crash and leave you with an UNOPENABLE file, not useable at all -- goodbye to who knows how many hours of work?It's interesting software and it's great with a Wacom tablet, but Corel just doesn't seem to be able to get their stuff together and I'm certainly not in a hurry to spend MORE money on a new version hoping they got it right.I mean, expecting to be able to save and re-open a file is not asking for the moon.
0	Painter IX Problems: We have used earlier versions of Painter and liked it. But the newly released version of Painter IX has serious Windows XP issues. Hope to be lucky or be prepared for endless hours trying to get it to run on your Windows XP machine.
1	Used For Drywall, Could Fit Better: I bought these for a the drywall we've been repairing due to two different leaks in our home. They worked okay for the most part. I also purchased the sander to hook up to the vacuum and I was totally happy with the setup. The vacuum did off and on come off so all the debris was going straight into the vacuum. I checked to make sure it was not user error. It was not, it just could have a little bit tighter fit on the rubber gasket that fits on the intake of the vacuum.I probably would purchase again because of the price, and how quickly it arrived. I didn't notice any dust spewing into the air, which is important with a little one in the home. As with any home repair there will be some dust as seen on the furniture.
1	Inspired: Clever, blasphemous, corrosively funny and sometimes poignant. It's the real thing. Let's face it: putting this in front of a pop music audience was like feeding oysters and icy vodka to a baby. No wonder it failed commercially. But it bears repeated listening, in my experience. Knowing Goethe's Faust (Part I) helps. The orchestration is creative, the melodies occasionally lovely. I only wish that it had been fully developed instead of staying in its unfinished form, because it would have ranked among the best of American musical theater. The remaining tracks are fragments of a brilliant work.
0	disappointment: I am a big Randy Neuman fan, but did not like this CD. The one song I bought it for was sung by someone else, not Randy, and 99% of the songs on it were biblical, like for a church service, and others were from the stage.
1	This book will keep you wondering until the end: I thought I could figure out the plot several times, but Victoria Holt spins away from the mundane. One never knows what's going to happen in the end.
1	Great Christmas Eve Movie: Watched this with our kids and what a great Christmas Eve movie. We can remember when this movie came out and might have seen it in the theaters. Got many chuckles out of the kids asking "what is that" refrencing the walkman or original Pepsi bottles. Great movie and great time with the family.
1	WHAT NOT TO DO WHEN GOING ON VACATION !!!!: MOVIE #1: CHILDREN LEFT BEHIND/ALONE .... CARELESS SUPERVISION BY PARENTS GOING ON VACATION ....MOVIE #2: CHILDREN LEFT BEHIND .... CARELESS SUPERVISION BY PARENTS GOING ON VACATION....MOVIE #3: CHILDREN LEFT ALONE .... CARELESS SUPERVISION BY PARENTS WORKING WITHOUT A NANNY IN HOMEE.....MOVIE #4: not yet watched by me....
0	Bummer!: Don't buy this thinking you are getting a Director's Cut. You get the movie with rambling talking over the whole movie. Normally when you buy something like this, it includes one disc with the actual movie and another disc with the director's cut as well as out takes, etc. If you want the movie - don't buy this! SUCH A BUMMER!
1	fitful: I think most of this movie is mediocre at best. It's contrived, formulaic, poorly written and acted. But, the half-hour of slapstick when the burglars are trying to break into the home is SO hilarious, it's worth sitting through the other parts. It's really a hilarious half hour. So, that's a mixed review!
1	home alone the christmas classic: i love this film macaulay culkin is a great actor and does great facial expressions...the plot as everyone must know by now is that an 8 year boy named kevin gets left behind at home as the family are goin' on holiday...and the burgulars that come too pay kevin a christmas visit have already been run to check the joint out as policeman..so kevin fills the house with traps yadda yadda yadda you get what i'm on about..get the film and forget about what "JD" OR "JB" they sucked too much dick and need to get a sense of humour so what if it doesn't all add up it's still a fantastic film so stop being an...polictal correctness weed will ya?
1	Fun movie: I love to watch this movie around Christmas. While not technically a "Christmas Movie" it does take place during the holiday season. The robbers are a little too over the top for my adult taste but after all the movie is targeted to kids so I can over look that.
1	We need to get this man more attention!! He is great.: Let me just say record companies who passed him up are making a mistake. This is quality real life good music. As is all of Rhett's music. "That Girl" is a song all of us guys seem to relate to and it makes us smile. Rhett is so right in "Trouble With a Woman". This is a perfect CD to listen to with your dad while out fishing or driving around the countryside with your high school buddies. And there are the songs that you will want your girl by your side as well. "Livin' Right" is my favorite song of all time! It is my story. It's beautiful. Everyone get this because you'll enjoy it and we owe it to the great Rhett.
1	A great read!: This piece of fiction is worth your time. It is written by one of the world's foremost authorities on military snipers and is the only technically accurate work of fiction about snipers I have ever come across. It is well written, and hard to put down. The characters are believable and likeable. It is a good companion piece to the author's non-fiction "One Shot Brotherhood"
1	History: This book came alive. I wanted to be there, I felt Tom's thoughts, I knew why Cassy was internally angry, and I wanted to help. I wonder if this book changed the conscience of society in the way it shifted my thinking. Harriet Beecher Stowe would be amazed with the improvements America has made. There is still a tremendous amount of hatred, racism and prejudice occurring today. Tom's morality gave strength to those around him. Close to one hundred years later Dr. King's anti-violent moral deliverance gave strength to those around him! The novel is pivotal for self reflection. If you're white and you lived in the1700's; what would be your stance on slavery? What is your stance on racial hatred and prejudice today? Do not let history repeat itself.
1	a classic: This classic moved me to tears in parts. Although it is wordy compared with modern writing, it is a "must" for all who care for those still being exploited today. If you have nerver read it before-do so asap!
1	An important learning experience on the system of slavery.: This novel portrays the unjust and cruel accounts of slavery through the lives of some very unique characters. The reader goes through some vauable life experiences with each one of the characters to see how slavery affects them personally. By doing this,Stowe, makes the reader aware of the effects that slavery can have ona human race dealing with the themes of family seperation,motherhood, religion and social cruelty. This easy-read novel provides a valuable learning experience for the reader on the instituion of slavery. I would recommend it to students from ninth grade up to adults who are willing to become educated in a vivid way on this topic.
1	Uncle Tom's Cabin: I purchased this book for my son. It was required reading for his11th grade Honors English class. He needed this book ASAP because as usual, he waits until the very last minute to tell me he has something due at school. I went to Amazon.com and found this book. The price was well within what I wanted to pay for the book. The time between ordering and receiving the book was only a couple of days. I was very pleased with both the item purchased and the time it took to receive the item. The book was in great condition also. I would buy from this seller again and again. Thanks! Tina B. Memphis, TN
1	What a Suprise!: I had heard of Uncle Tom's Cabin all my life and finally decided to read it. What a wonderful suprise! It is well written, has well-developed characters, a fast-moving plotline and is very inspirational. I was amazed at how it is openly Christian. I have heard people be called "Uncle Toms" in a derogatory way. After reading this book I'd say "wow, what a complement ... Uncle Tom is an awesome example!
0	Not Faithfully Reproduced: This Kindle edition is not accurately reproduced. Don't waste money on it. In my edition at Loc 2416 appears "I don't know either about religion's being up in the market,". It then continues with something completely out of context and including the character Ophelia St. Clare. The correct continuation appears at Loc 2447, so that the rendering should have been, "I don't know either about religion's being up in the market,just now. I have not looked in the papers." Between Loc 2416 and 2447 is a different part of the book.This kind of error is shameful. Amazon should refund the money paid for the book to every Kindle purchaser of it.
1	A Powerful and Moving Book: It is easy to see why this book became the clarion call for abolitionism prior to the Civil War. The narrative is riviting and powerfully wrought with characters so vividly rendered I felt I could almost reach out and touch them. I first became acquainted with excerpts of this book in high school but never read it in its entirety. Now that I have finally completed it 46 years lager, it ranks as one of the most compelling novels I have read.
0	Long and stupid.: I didn't really enjoy reading this book. The language was too archaic for me to read (and understand) it. Don't read this book.
1	book: This book has to be read to understand the impact it had on America. Words alone cannot describe the emotions one feels when reading it
1	something to think about: Uncle Toms Cabin was an interesting book discussing the hardships of slavery in the1800s. It takes you through life in the eyes of a slave, Tom. Uncle Toms Cabin shows you the hardships slaves went through to not get a beating from their master, though many endured that anyway. It opened my eyes to the reality of slavery, and the severity of it all. The book not only talks about slavery, but it also addresses the issue of religion. Although I did not get a chance to read Uncle Toms Cabin carefully, I enjoyed what I could of it and would definitely re-read it so I could get a better understanding.i would also definitely recommend this book to anyone that is interested in reading about the slavery issues of the1800s.
1	one of my all-time fav CDs: I instantly fell in love with Le Tigre, it was one of those magical experiences at the listening station where I knew this cd would affect me so much as to leave a deep impact crater a mile wide!I have been listening to it for weeks...just listen to it...NOW!
0	2 girls, 3 girls, or no girls...does it matter?: If going to see a concert doesn't neccicarily expect the creation of live music, then I guess this band is ok.But I went to see Le Tigre play-- and while they did get everybody to dance, I was shocked to see that all they did for half their songs was press play and then dance metaphorically-sloppy corriographed dance moves. The Le Tigre experience means shouting a "mediocre" theme repeatedly and jumping from side to side tossing your head... I just think other bands have achieved this and even more. I am concearned because of how old most of the audience was... in their late teens and early 20s. Maybe it's the X and coke and heroine coming back in place of LSD... kids are not wandering into other levels of the room, they are ripping up the sheets and jumping on the bed of rock and roll.
0	Just ok: I used it for the first time last night. Worked well as far as the pounding part but I put it in the dishwasher and it came out dull with lots of gray stuff rubbing off. That is why I replaced my old one that had belonged to my mother. If you can't put a meat pounder in the dw what good is it.
1	"Good Grips" Tenderizer: The OXO tenderizer does it's job remarkably well, with little to no sustained damage over multiple uses. However, it's very difficult to clean and doesn't fit in my dishwasher easily.But, if you don't mind some additional time for cleaning, this is a perfect kitchen appliance!
0	A Letdown: the movie promised much and delivered nothing!! Two stars for the actors who did a good job with a lousy scenario and plot.
0	The Signal: The actors were fantastic but the film itself contained too much blood, gore and senseless killing. Purchase only if you love blood and killing in films.
0	Has no meaning but killing and beating each others: This movie has no meaning or story to tell except beating and killing each other for no reason from start to end.
1	Great to see you again Toni!: The beautiful Toni Braxton has made an excellent comeback with her single "He Wasn't Man Enough For Me." It is a song filled with energy, emotion and exemplary vocals by this fine diva from Severn, Maryland. The musical beats in this song are hypnotic. When listening to this single one has no choice but to get up to dance and party. This songs puts a person in such a great mood.This song possesses a distinct quality from her other songs in that it is groovy and funky R&B tune. Toni Braxton's notable vocals on this single has definitely put her over the edge."Great single Toni! It's so glad to have you back. I really hope this will help alleviate the hardship that you have gone through. Life has its ups and down. I have no doubts that she you will see a promising future. I pray for great talented artists like you. Keep up the great work Toni!""He Wasn't Man Enough" receives a Kenny rating of A+.
1	He wasn't man enough: well tony i thing that this song is very good actually it is great. I like this song because i have just got out of a relationship and the girl is worred about me and she should be worring about he. He's a cheater ,lier. but any way great song, can't want for it to come out iam going to buy it thanks keely
1	Relaxing: This is a relaxing CD that i enjoy listening to when i get home from work or have had a stressing day in general. Well worth listening to
0	Country Cheese: Before we get into this too far, I have to say: I knew all about the Grateful Dead from friends but I had never bought an LP (or ripped a bootleg) so from say -1972 - to today (2009) I had none of their stuff. I was more into the Allman Brothers and the Doobie Brothers (pre and post Michael McDonald that is). That was where my head was at. SO - I finally got my first GD album - Europe 72,just a couple of weeks ago, on a recommendation - and to me, it is just this side of mediocre. What is the big deal? They sound like any number of C&W bands that roll into my town for the annual C&W Festival. I'm serious, this album is boring. It is the kind of stuff that we used to play in our sheds to warm up. Maybe Europe in1972 wan't ready for the GD, but for me it is a snoozeathon. Sorry, but it bites the big one.
1	Great watch: It's more like a computer though, it's super smart. A very helpful tool to track heart rate, speed, distance, time, etc. The red is nice too.
1	A Practical Handbook for Modern Living: David K Reynolds is our foremost author on the subject of "Constructive Living", part philosophy, part Shinto-Buddhism, part psychotherapy, but100% practical and useful in our normal daily life. David's style always amazes me and this book is no exception: In a short, affordable volume of less than100 pages, in an afternoon's reading and for less than the cost of lunch, he asks those questions which strike right at the very heart of our troubles and changes our lives forever. This is not a book about buddhism, it's not about digging in your psychological closets, it's just plain sense insight into how we can live more constructively.
1	Simply Nice!: ...Such a fine piece of music. Mel, George and the producers are simply the best right here and now. I have played Bass since early1950. This fellow . . . Brian Torff on the Bass, simply makes me happy. That's the way I might have played if I simply had the tallent that Torff has. You need a gift from God in order to play like Torff does.Thanks for still being alive!
1	Worth it: I think Mary-Kate and Ashley are great on this DVD. I really enjoy this new show of theirs and this particular DVD really makes them seem older and it's funny. Plus there are cute boys. Another fabulous point, they dress soooo well and I just really wish I was one of them.
1	message from a pro: Locksmiths have launch a private war against publications like this in an effort to protect their "secrets". This book is the most popular lock picking books in the world and is going to sell, regardless of the bad press from Locksmiths. The only lock picking secrets you can learn from locksmiths is; there is more money in drilling out locks than picking them.
1	Excellent Blackjack book: The best beginners blackjack book around. I found it not only presented a very workable system, but it explained it clearly and easily. The first chapters do an excellent job of explaining the "history" of blackjack, and the next chapters gradually add to the complexity of the count. My only complaint is that the "full" system with all the indices is not explained better. Otherwise, does an excellent job of explaining a very good system for counting cards that a beginner can handle and that many experts use.
1	Highly recommended!: This is a very easy system to learn, still it's among the most powerful and profitable systems ever created. Even if you want to go professional it should be one of your first choices. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to beat the dealer, aren't a math genius and wants to have some fun.
1	I made money with this book!: I actually made money in Las Vegas after reading this book! Did I get rich..NO, but making a few hundred dollars made me feel like a million bucks! Card counting is easy especially if you go to the "beginners" tables they have at some casinos where the dealers don't make small talk to try and distract you while you are playing. You can beat the house sometimes and it is just plain fun to learn a system and use it effectively. The real key is to know when to quite and don't spend more than 45 minutes at a table or you start to get fatigued from the concentration required to do this.
0	Out Dated and Stale: While the KO system gives players a slight advantage, this book neglects the fact that you will only win with counting if you play A LOT. With how much you have to play to make a profit, why stick with an old and oversimplified system? For only a few more hours of work you can learn a level two system and make way more money. The KO system is the easy way out and pays accordingly. Most of this information can be found online anyways. If you are serious about making money counting, leave this count behind and pick up a book with a level two system.
1	A Solid Book - though a touch dated.: This book gave a solid grounding in what is available and a broad idea of how to use each of the options, such as IPSec with Openswan; PPTP with PopTop, using SSH+PPP, and other more proprietary VPN methods.Some of the info is a bit dated; For example, many Linux kernels these days come standard with support for IPSec and PPTP as modules. I definitely recommend after reading this book and deciding on a VPN strategy, that you find quality web sites with more up-to-date information about how to configure your selected VPN technology on your selected Linux distribution. I chose Debian/GNU Linux myself. With this book and some updated information added to that foundation, I feel like I have a good start.
1	Lenox Christmas Table Cloth: Perfect, just what I wanted. Will be great on table next Christmas. I have shower curtain and bath accessories also in this design.
0	Fits buts needs modification: Not a drop-in replacement. Needed to cut a piece of plastic flange to get it to fit. Overall it works and matches the original.
0	Awesome Gadget: This thing scoops out rock hard ice cream so easily. I've gone through many ice cream scoopers and I stuggled with all of them. Yes, it is more like a slab of ice cream than a scoop, but if it's going in a bowl and not a cone, then so what. No more letting the ice cream sit out for10 minutes.*UPDATE*I should have updated this a while ago, as I threw this thing out a long time ago. It's coated in some non-stick material that I noticed flakes of in my ice cream. Since it's only used for ice cream, I can't imagine what caused it to flake off. It never goes in the dishwasher, either. I still love the design, but I'm not interested in eating teflon, or whatever they use to coat this. One star, not five!
0	fun at times but ....well stupid: Sure this album presents a reason for you to bob your head. It allows you to have fun. but on the other hand the lyrics are so bad that i feel dumb for tuning in. While many view the uk subs as punk pioneers i feel they are in all essense just another band. The album drones on for what seems like hours, and is so rendundant that i find it hard to distinguish one song from the next. There are maybe a few fun spots such as "cid", or "new york state police but other than that the hub bub is wrong.
1	Val Kilmer Pulls A Rabbit Out Of The Hat: In the first three minutes of this film, Val Kilmer tells you not to judge him until you have viewed his life (this film). This film begins rather depressingly with several druggie losers and multiple large body tattoos and the worst narcotics -- and our druggie loser Val Kilmer trapped in a fire. A film that begins this low, this fatal, how could it get better? How can we root for such a pathetic loser? Hang in there! You will be surprised at the ending. Really surprised. Next to "Tombstone", one of Val's best. Did I mention, you will be surprised at the ending?
1	Nothing is as it seems: Val Kilmer's character warns the viewer right at the beginning that nothing is what it appears to be. Is Kilmer Danny, a punk-rock meth tweaker turned police snitch? Or is he a talented jazz musician named Todd Van Allen? The beautifully shot film noir presents many pieces to the puzzle, all of which fit together perfectly for a shocker of an ending. There really aren't words to decribe the movie or the storyline--it's just something you have to let unfold for itself.Vincent D'Onofrio is stellar as the villianous messed-up desert drug king in the movie.It's strange that this movie is cross-marketed with Spun so frequently. Yes, both are set in the world of methamphetamine, but Spun is an almost comedic train wreck of a drug trip, while The Salton Sea is a larger than life fable that happens to be set in the world of the Southern California meth industry.
1	Hornblower wins again!: This book continues the adventures of Horatio in to the Tropics. He has this great humility that comes across as hilariously funny, especially during times of crisis.The rlationship with his wife is detailed more in these stories which shows his more warm and human side.I feel like I would like him if I met him.
1	Definitly a Light Read: This is a nice little book. Princess Alesandra goes to England to escape an almost insane general who wants to marry her. She goes to England to find her own husband so General Ivan would not be able to force her to marry him. In a roundabout fashion she marries Colin. Seperately these are two wonderful people and I liked how they worried about each other, but I hated Colin's high- handed methods. He was always ordering Alesandra what to do and what not to do. What I really hated though was that Alesandra always gave in. I like JUlie Garwood, but this is definitly not her best work. I like independent women who aren't submissive. Okay if you are really bored and not in the mood to yell at the characters stupidity.
0	not worth the time of a long time fan: This story greatly disappointed me. The character of Princess Alesander has great similarity with Christina from the book titled "Lion's Lady". Both make the hero confuse and make you laugh to read their act in trying to understanding the lady. It's fun for the first time fan. But not worth the time of a long time fan like me
1	Classic.: From the moment track one begins until the final fade out, you won't regret this purchase. Finally, an underground rapper with enough action in his words to break out of the backpack. There's some great production here by El-P, Ant, and RJD2, but the rapping is so much better. If you find that underground rap it too cerebral and wishy-washy sometimes, you owe it to yourself to buy this.
1	A brilliant book for the beginng investor or corporate executive: Mr. Buffet does a remarkable job of simplifying the complexities of investing. His homespun stories and self-deprecating humor make the subject matter entertaining, easy to understand and very useful.It is remarkable for a man of his stature in the investment world to openly discuss his many mistakes and bad investment decisions and yet, we should all be so lucky as to have the fortitude and the wisdom to invest with the same degree of success that he has experienced - even with much smaller sums of money.I highly recommend this book to everyone that owns common stock.
0	Good General Knowledge But Needs More Information: I just read this guidebook for the second time. It provides a good overview of living in Mexico, Guatemala, Costa Rica and Ecuador. However, I think anyone seriously considering living in Costa Rica or Mexico would profit more by reading one of the other travel guidebooks about residing in these countries. The other guides deal specifically with these countries and provide much more complete information.
1	Tonny Harnnel debut: This is the Tonny's debut on TNT and shows exacltly why he stayed therte for over 20 years. Seven Seas is still as good today as it was then ans all tne other songs are great too. Must have for fans.
0	boring and poorly written: I don't know how anyone could have enjoyed this book. It's horrible! There's no plot in Persian Nights whatsoever and I practically fell asleep every time I tried to read it. After reading and enjoying Le Divorce I found this book by Diane Johnson to be far worse. I recommend this book be avoided by anyone who does not want to sit through a slow, dull, and overall bad read. I honestly don't know how it got any good reveiws at all. Try one of her other novels maybe, but steer clear of this one!
0	Ugly Americanism!: The title of my review states my opinion ofthe book . I will not waste my time any further
1	Classic Diane Johnson, very funny: Like Le Divorce, Diane Johnson once again serves us a teaspoon of female angst in a foreign locale. I always find her books to be very funny, written in her unique sardonic tone. The only complaint that I have is that like Le Divorce, the book has a slow start and takes a while to get into. But the endings are always satisfying and action-packed. What I like most about her books is that Johnson always makes the heroine very human, but albeit likable. Chloe is obviously self-centered, but it becomes apparent how well this serves her by the end of the book. Lots of plot twists make this perfect beach reading. I reccommend it highly.
0	Campy in the extreme!: This is such an atrociously awful movie that it's a joy to watch. You have to be aware of the real life events that were ongoing during the making of "The Klansman." Burton and Taylor were busting up and Burton was awash in vodka. He arrived in Oroville, California and promptly proposed to an18 year Denny's waitress. His costar, Lee Marvin, was also drinking a bottle a day. Neither was sober for a single syllable of this terrible movie and their struggles to appear sober make for some hilarious moments.Burton, as usual, dreadfully overacts and his attempts at a Southern accent are pitiful, to say the least. Marvin's acting is much better, but when he has to speak inane lines from a miserable script, he can't fare much better.This is a great movie to watch with a couple of beers. If you appreciate a terrible script, crude sets and two major stars who were drunk out of their minds while filming, you'll love this one.
1	Best Jung book for the layperson: This book was written with the layman in mind, the book examines the average person's need to find his soul. All of the ideas in this book are still as valid as they were when the book was first written. But the need for this book is more than ever.
0	Not happy: When I got my nozzles, they where not what is shown in the pictures, you show here! And I payed $13. and change too return them! I would like my money back, but mostly would like too get10 of the nozzle shown!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1	High quality ricer: This was a gift for my sister-in-law. She was thrilled with it! It has a nice long handle, which was what she was looking for, and it is a nice size and has a nice feel, as do many Good Grips products.
1	Perfect mashed potatoes: This tool is a must-have for preparing mashed potatoes. It takes all of the effort and lumps out of making perfect mashed potatoes.A little bit of potatoes can squeeze out from the top of the lid as you push it down (which is why I only gave 4 stars) but since the gap is so narrow, what squeezes out is also "mashed" so it can be thrown in with the rest of the potatoes.My girlfriend complained that it is a little hard to squeeze when packed to the rim with potatoes, but this can be controlled by putting less potatoes in it each time.Overall an excellent product. Very easy to clean.
1	Mashing Made Easy: Mashed potatoes is a pinch with this product! The press is well constructed with durable materials and dyes that easily pop out for cleaning.Pros:-heavy-quick-relatively inexpensive but good quality-easy to cleanCons (but manageable!):-heavy (another style may be better for people with joint issues)-potatoes sometimes squeeze through the top-does require scraping bottom to remove potato (apparently other styles come with a feature that swipes the bottom clean for you)
1	best cd purchase i've made(3 years ago)still my favorite: I own three of elliot smith's cds. either/or, elliot smith, and figure eight. what is so great about my collection is that each cd has a certain mood to it. they're all different but definetly smith. the great thing about either/or is how it is just his voice and the acoustics. when you put your headphones on and just listen you can hear every little detail like when he takes a breath to start a new stanza. like you're right there. the music is personal. my favorite song is number 4 "between the bars". THEY ARE ALL GREAT! IF YOU LIKE LOW-KEY ACOUSTIC THIS IS FOR YOU. HOPE YOU APPRECIATE AND ENJOY AS MUCH AS I DO! ROCK ON!
0	Self Promoting: I bought this book hoping for stories of ghostly legends from New England. What I got was some guy who considers himself a ghost hunter that has a friend that supposedly can connect with the ghosts that haunt the places they visit.Reading this book was like watching a TV special, you know the kind, where the magician picks someone out from the audience and keeps on saying "now I do not know you, nor have I ever met you".I really wished I did not buy this book.
1	Bmod book: Book in perfect condition. Thanks for getting it to me relatively quickly and at a good price!
0	This product is a joke: I bought RS ARP-900E Portable Air Conditioner - 9000 BTU from Fry's yesterday. It is over $400. Today I am going to return it. Of course, it only takes a few minutes to set up and very easy for anyone to operate it. We set it up and tried for a few hours, and then we feel extremely disappointed. If you live in the South and your room's temperature reaches 90 F and you wish to use a portable air conditioner to cool the room down, good luck. This product can only cool a little spot where it is pointing. The vent hose gets very hot and you can feel the heat like a little stove behind the air conditioner. So it cools down the air in one spot and heats up the air in another spot of the room. I read a customer's review before who believed to give it10 years for the technology to develop. Now, I understand why he/she said that. I'll say to give it over15 years for engineers to work on it before it is put on markets.
0	No changes here: I do like crossing the t's on the top, and writing my first initial as the star A, but other than that, I generally find it a rather ugly script. Perhaps that's why it's not working for me, but I've not noticed any changes in myself or my life despite months of writing the t's and A's as she says.
0	kind of boring: You know ,I have to apologetically say I didn't really like this too much. I love bluegrass and play banjo but it just wasn't my style. I expected alot of creativity but it was just kind of predictable and rock and rollish. I threw it away.
0	Skip it!: Very basic book that covers no new ground. Go to your local library and find a fitness/weight lifting book. You won't miss anything by taking this route and passing on this relatively useless book.
0	OXO Fail.: I love OXO. I thought they could do no wrong. But this apple corer/divider was a waste of money. We had an old stainless steel one without the handles, so I thought this one would work better. It does not work any better at all! The apple gets stuck in it, and it's a pain to clean.
1	useful: Since I am partially disabled, this makes it easy to add some fruit to my diet. I don't only use it on apples.
1	Great corer/slicer for the price: I have owned one of these before and am on my second one. This utensil has been used, abused, dishwashed, handwashed, used for Playdoh cutting, cookie cutting, chopping, etc. for about 6 years. I am happy it lasted as long as it did. It works great.
1	Awsome Set: Saw this show live and it was awsome! If you closed your eyes you'd have thought you went back in time 30 years. As tight as ever. They've lost NOTHING over the years (except maybe a little hair).
0	Don't Bother: This brush didn't last a month. The bristles are too soft and become deformed. I last used it when I steamed cleaned my barbeque grill and then tossed it.
1	Not a review, but this will likely help others if a reply is received: Hoping one of the three reviewers of this product can help me out with info:Are these blades oiled or coated or not? Thanks in advance for any/all help!
1	Beyond The Shackles: Gripping, passionate, moving - a story of courage and hope when life presented none of the above.
0	Agree that OXO could have done better: PROS: Cuts well enough for my kitchen use; comfortable to grip w/extra large opening for fingers and no place to get my thumb stuck as has happened w/other scissors; fairly easy to take apart/assemble for cleaning & sharpening.CONS: The locking latch flipping into the locked position during use is a major flaw; the handles come completely together so you have to be careful not to get the skin of your palm pinched (trust me, it's very painful).
0	Loose screw: I received these shears as a gift. Shortly after the first use, the shears came apart. I looked in the drawer and found all the pieces and reassembled the shears. The middle screw is loose and doesn't completely tighten. Every time before I use the shears, I have to tighten the screw. After one time in the dishwasher, the metal spring was rusted. I'm shopping for new shears.
0	mine broke too - a stain upon the good reputation of OXO: as an oxo-ite, i usually trust the OXO brand for quality; but no more.this multi grater broke - the plastic holding the large grate cracked into pieces on the lower left corner. almost as disappointing as my recent stock portfolio performance.their materials engineer, possibly a former AIG credit-default-swap analyst, needs to be sent back to engineering school for re-education.or mark the product - "Safely Use Only with Velveeta or Tofu"caveat emptor, oxo-ites. long live MicroPlane!
0	Way too flimsy!: Most of the OXO products hold up but this grater broke grating cheddar cheese. After writing this review, I'm going to order an all metal grater.
0	Broke After a few Uses: I bought it because I thought the design was innovative and useful. It grated OK a few times, but the plastic frame holding the metal grate cracked at the corners and eventually broke.
1	excellent grater no problems: Contrary to the claim of some other reviewers, this grater comes apart easily for cleaning. Mine has no cracks in the plastic and has worked very well for me the entire time I've had it. I strongly recommend it especially at the price its being sold for.
0	Worked well for a while...: This grater was nice, but it is not constructed well. The plastic housing around the metal graters cracked within a year of minimal use. It was difficult to clean. And as others have said, it would have been better if it spread wider than it does. I typically love OXO products, but I have replaced this one with a solid steel grater. If you're looking for a grater that will last, look elsewhere.
0	Huh?: After watching this movie, the biggest question in my mind is: Huh? What was the point of the film? I bought this expecting a film on the reality of following Jesus. There was only a cursory treatment of some of the issues that the church faces (i.e. church-goers vs. Jesus-followers). If I was a skeptic I could appreciate their honesty but there's nothing in it that would make me say "OK I want to follow Jesus." I also found their discussion about the opposite sex distracting from the message of the film. There were two positives however. The second-to-last chapter (Lucerne Switzerland) contains the most profound statement in the film. And it was pretty funny.
1	SACD's Rock: Great disc originally and now even better. Sounds excellent at home on my SACD player, pretty good in the car. A bit bassey in the car but other than that a fine trade up from the original CD recording that was put out some 20 years ago. I have them both and play them side by side and can really hear the SACD difference. Well worth replacing the original and upgrading to SACD players!
1	Deserves Its "Classic Album" Status: Elton was so prolific at this point that he could release 5 studio albums in 3 years, a live album, a movie sound track and still have enough for a two record set. This one is a keeper, with songs that could have fit in on any of his earlier albums. (I'm thinking "Danny Bailey" and "Roy Rogers" on Tumbleweed Connection, and "Harmony" for Elton John, to name a few") There are, of course, the obligatory monster singles "Good Bye Yellow Brick Road," "Saturday Night's All Right For Fighting," "Benny And The Jets," and the single that never was "Candle In The Wind." What sets this album apart is the opening "Funeral For A Friend/Love Lies Bleeding," an Elton staple in his 70's concerts. All in all, this is definitely his best.
1	Probably his best era: In my opinion this is probably the best era for Elton John as well as many other musicians during that time. Not that I'm casting any doubt on the fine quality of his music in succeeding years, but this style of music with complex melodic arrangements and accompanying guitars to back his piano stylings heralds a time when music was an odyssey into the imagination.
1	The Best of Elton: This is a landmark album for Elton John. It contains many memorable melodies and lyrics from one of rock and roll's most prolific and talented songwriting teams since Lennon and McCartney. Elton shows off his incredible piano abilities and tremendous voice on such varied songs as the gorgeous "Candle in the Wind," and "Saturday Night's Alright For Fighting." Elton John has a way with writing compelling music to fit Bernie Taupin's unique lyrical style. This shows on standouts like the title track, and the infectious "Bennie and the Jets." Captain Fantastic lives up to his title on this LP. And be sure to catch Elton John live if you haven't already, he's even better in concert!
1	The Greatest Album of All Time: This is with out a doubt the most inspiring album that I have ever heard. To put it more simply, if I could own only one single album, this would be that album. Truely the high point of the genius that is Elton John.
1	Absolutely his best album: This is Sir Elton at his finest. Before he turned too pop, this album ROCKS!! Aside from the hits, All the young girls love alice, dirty little girl, ive seen that movie too are really great songs possibly a sound you may not have heard from him yet, but will enjoy im sure. In my top 5 albums of all time.
1	Stunned at how good the sound on this SACD: I have many SACDs and DVD Audio discs but none hit me as hard as this one did. I was floored at the sound quality and the perfection of the mixing job for a 5.1 system. I never appreciated this album fully until now. Please get full range speakers for all 5 speakers to truly benefit from these SACD's.
1	So it's derivative... so what?: Like at least these guys have good taste about who they borrow from. Heck they sound like the Beatles, the Velvet Underground, the Strokes, the Fall, Supertramp, Beck, the Strawberry Alarm Clock, the Stooges, Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin, Tortoise, Joy Division, Flaming Lips, Os Mutantes, Television, Spoon, Neil Young, the Cure, Pavement(!) ect etc etc! It's not easy cramming so many influences into 37 minutes of music. And yet, trite as it may sound, they have a style unique unto themselves. Beautiful and creepy are pretty much unavoidable adjectives to use in describing this sound. This is up there for the best album of 2002.
0	Dopey and charmless, but toddlers like it: Why are Spot videos so popular? It can't be for the chintzy animation, with mouths that don't move and cheesy computer paste-ons. It's not the story; there isn't one. Each segment is just a series of non sequiturs that occur in the same venue. Spot isn't educational; the videos don't teach anything concrete like numbers or shapes, and any socialization the videos show is bad (e.g. making fun of how fat Helen Hippo is). It can't be the voices (the same man and woman are obviously doing all the voices except Spot, with ridiculous accents and changes of pitch) or the dopey, repetitive music with inane lyrics. And it's not because Spot is so appealing; while he doesn't rival Barney for most annoying kids' character, Spot is boring and charmless. When there are fresh, original and delightful videos like the Maisy series, Blues Clues or even the old standby, Sesame Street, why bother with this drivel? Oh yeah, because my toddler likes it.
0	Zzzzzzz....: My god....I picked this book up hoping for a well written, informative, in depth, description and analysis of what our special forces are doing in Afghanistan...What it seems to be is 200+ pages of griping, whining, and complaining about how a group of men didn't go out and get to kill people...It is filled with repetetive descriptions of driving here there and everywhere...more or less the book could have been boiled down to about10 pages of relevent information and that would have sufficed...wouldn't bother to waste your time...you'd be far better off rereading Black Hawk Down or the like...
1	Friendship triangles: Everyone has experienced the rejection, or supposed rejection of a best friend. Simon feels his friendship with Molly is overshadowed by her friendship with Hester, the new girl in the neighborhood. A very real problem for children is brought to life in this tale of a friendship triangle. Jahn-Clough's illustrations are bright and cheerful when the children are playing and having fun, but become dark and foreboding when Simon questions his friendship with Molly.
0	Shameless and misleading: ATTENTION AMAZON:I recently found out that this so called "V. Productions / Ron Allen" is none other than Richard Myles himself and that he goes around self promoting himself under aliases on various review boards and bashing his competition (see the scathing comments toward Chris .R. Notarile right here).Check out his reviews here on Amazon and you will see that in most cases, no matter what is being reviewed, it winds up being a glowing review of Richard Myles, his music or his movie "Mental Scars".Shame on you Richard Myles for misleading people and shame on you for all the hate toward Chris .R. Notarile as he was good enough to cast you in his fan film as Freddy Krueger.
1	The easiest grater: This grater has the best design available. You squeeze the body of it while turning the knob on top (sort of like a peppermill with a turning handle). Makes light fluffy grated cheese easy, easy, easy.
0	Piece of Junk: ...the head twists off if you apply even the smallest amount of presure. On top of that, the soap pours out when the head twists off, because this is where you fill the dispenser.
0	god awful: i purchased this camera on this site nearly a year ago. since that time, i've taken it on two major vacations (alaska and paris) and was dissappointed with the results. my friend and travel companion purchased disposable cameras and took better pictures than i did. a month ago, i went to montana on vacation and took pictures with the evoca. each one turned out with a bright halo like ring of light surrounding the boarder of the photo.....50% of the pictures were completely indistinguishable.i tested it again in las vegas with the same halo like result. so much for the high price tag and fancy lens....
1	Don Camillo will pep you up to kick any rascals in humour: My home library contains some fabulous titles from Signor Guareschi. Over the years my wife and my brother and I have started guarding them with our lives. Particularly the above title. What a sublime humour and a bygone era. I went to Italy to see Palmar and the river Po. Made lot of Italian friends on that trip. Read Guareschi. Particularly the House that Nino Built.
0	RIP OFF!!!: This is nice looking and well made . . . with one exception. The wires break after very little use. I have two of these and have used them no more than half a dozen times (on medium to soft cheeses) each when the cutter wires broke. The rip off is that the replacement wires by the manufaturer cost another $14.00 for just three wires. Somebody's making some money here: but they won't get any more of mine.MOD
0	price too high for what you get: book was flimsey and the price on the book was less than I paid pretty sure it was a used book whats up with that?
1	Great cookbook: This is my frst cookbook by Jamie Oliver but it wont be my last.I enjoy his style of cooking which is about using healthy and good foods and making delicious but not complicated food.The cookbook itself is full of yummy color pictures of the dishes and was gorgeous just to look at.
1	Easy and colorful: It's a great book, plenty if recipes really easy and with a lot of variety. It has influences from a lot of different countries and the plates are very healthy. A lot of good ideas.
1	This DVD is tropical HOT with crankin' music: I bought Hip Hop Bad Girls Brazil. This DVD is AWESOME!!!. The women have glorius rear ends and there are butts-a-plenty. I have never been teased better by a video than this one. The night time sky of Rio is breath taking in some of the shots and the women are strikingly beautiful. It's a very interesting concept. The hip hop tracks behind the booty is phat. This DVD is silicone-free unlike MOST DVD's of this type. All natural booty..uh..I mean beauty. Plus there are SO many upskirt teases and hot babes on the beach. More please... give me more.
1	Great...: Great quality and a lower price, for me is like a tailored jean, I'm happy with this product. No more to say thanks to all
0	bad fit: they were too long and didn't fit the waist as advertized. the price was okay and the delivery was fine. overall, i was disappointed and would not repeat my order.
0	Not the same: Ive been wearing Levi's over 40 years. These are not the same old Levi's! The fit is baggy, the sizing is not consistant, I bought 2 pair and they fit and wear are totally different. Probably won't buy any levi products again
1	LIBERACE: AN AMERICAN BOY: THIS BOOK IS DIFFERENT FROM OTHER LIBERACE BOOKS. PUBLISHED BY, ST. MARTIN'S UNIVERSITY PRESS, IT DOES NOT FOCUS SO MUCH ON LIBERACE'S JEWELS, COSTUME ECT., BUT RATHER, WHAT EVENTS IN LIBERACE'S LIFE SHAPED THE PERSON HE WAS TO BECOME.HIS PRODUCER AND DIRECTOR OF 30 YEARS (RAY ARNETT) IS AN EXTREMELY CLOSE FRIEND OF MINE FOR MANY YEARS NOW; HE ALSO LOVED THE BOOK
1	GREAT MOVIE !!!: I've always loved this movie. I think I originally saw it on H.B.O. late one night. The movie never got any recognition. That's probably why it was only showed at 3 A.M. Those time slots are usually reserved for movies that skipped the movie theatre and came straight to video. This movie is not available on D.V.D. (as of August16th, 2003). It is also out-of-print on V.H.S. I had to buy a used copy of it on ebay. I'm hoping that one day it will be out on D.V.D., but that may never happen. I won't hold my breath. I won't get into the movie's plot either. You can look that up on the internet. I just wanted to say that I liked this movie a lot and wish more people latched onto it. Another good movie from the1980's that got little attention, was the movie "Ghosttown". Check it out. It to, is not available on D.V.D. and is also out-of-print on V.H.S. You can get used copies of it on ebay also. Definitely check out "Prison". I think that you will enjoy it. I did.
1	Takes the Pain Out of Getting the Cork Out: I'm not a wine connoisseur, but I do like a good Cab or Merlot on occasion. Until now I was opening my wine bottles with a free cork screw I got at the local liquor store. It's worked fine for years, you screw the corkscrew into the bottle, hold the bottle tightly and pull out the cork. It does require a little effort.But this baby requires none, you put over the top of the bottle, screw the skinny screw in, pull gently down on the levers and you've effortlessly opened your bottle.
0	strangely disappointing: Perhaps I shouldn't have expected much from such an inexpensive item, but right off the bat it seemed off-kilter somehow: the screw tended to go at an angle into the cork, making it hard to withdraw and more likely to break. I haven't had extensive experience with corkscrews; still, this one seems unnecessarily, even dangerously, sharp to me. There's a little round collar on the top that's supposed to keep the screw from wiggling around and it pops out of its socket a lot. The idea's a good one - the easy-to-grip parts and the size and so forth - but it doesn't seem to work well in practice. I've been struggling along with this for almost a year, but I think I'll try one of the wine waiter corkscrews now.
0	Oxo Corkscrew: Don't waste you time and money on this corkscrew. It broke within the first week's use...good concept, but poorly constructed.
1	6 months - so far: Flawless: I've been into sampling wine now for about 6 months. I read the reviews, looked at the prices, and decided to start with this device as a "de-corker."Well, by now I've decided that if I've got more money I want to spend, it's for wine not for a different corkscrew since this one has opened many bottles with zero failures.You line up the opener, turn the screw, watch the wings unfold, turn down the wings and the cork comes out with no problems. It has not yet failed to remove all of the cork, whole, with no fragments. It's fast, clean, relatively effortless, and cheap.I'm an obvious "newbie" to wine, but seriously - this thing is really underpriced. I'm ordering another for a backup.
1	Best Revenge: How Theater Saved My Life and Has Been Killing: This is a terrific book. It's a great read, a marvelous look at the struggles of an artist trying to make a living in the theater, and a must buy for anyone who plans to make the theater his or her life.
0	I suppose I should have seen it coming: Jars of Clay has gone from being a really good band, to being a really good christian band. Lyrically and muscially i find nothing moving about the eleventh hour. Perhaps my perspective is skewed because I want to hear something sonically comprable to their debut. Whatever the reason, the eleventh hour is a good cd, but nothing to marvel over. Maybe they will quit trying to be like other bands and go back to what they are good at...Sounding like Jars of Clay.
1	SHOCKS AND SURPRISES ABOUND: Bestselling author Delinsky broadens her field with her latest by adding a touch of mystery to romance. Voice performer/director Sandra Burr offers a highly listenable reading to this tale of three women - one of whom is missing.Sisters Savannah and Susan are rivals, perhaps experiencing the sibling jealousies common to many, until they join forces to solve the kidnaping of Megan, a well-to-do mutual friend. As they begin to explore possibilities both are resistibly drawn to two very different men.Jared Snow is a late night disc. jockey with a voice that seduces; Sam Craig is a macho detective whom Susan cannot resist.Shocks and surprises abound as the investigation leads Savannah and Susan further into the discovery of dark machinations and deeper into the heart of love.
1	Hands Down: My Favorite Common Album, good beats good lyrics nothing hardcore just a good album, my favorite song is THISISME!
1	Resurrecting hip-hop: This is a great cd. I just got it and I have gotten addicted to this true style. Common showcases pure genuis in I used to love her. And book of life. Any one who loves hip hop should buy this cd.
1	Common: Resurrection is an awesome album. Produced in1994 it broke the mold of the gangsta rap that was so prevalent. A very musical album with songs your sure to play over and over again; Common's "Resurrection" is a must have.
1	Common is what Hip hop suppose to ...Be: Ok, this CD is for Hip Hop heads only. If you like non-lyrical mc's and catchy hooks don't waste your time. Common is a throw back to times where the rap game was fun. On the classic track "I Use To Love Her", Common takes us on a journey threw the life of hip hop. This song will clearly remain timeless kind of like Will Smith's "Summertime" or Biggies "Juicy". You get the point! Anyway, Resurrection is filled with creative jams such as "Watermelon", "Book of Life", "In My Own World", and "Communism". This MC brings us into his crazy little world where he allows us to laugh as well as cry. Common is one of the reasons hip hop fans can feel secure b/c the new fads will can never change an individual who loves the art so much.....thanks for the Classict-hanes
1	Buy This Album At All Costs!: This C.D. is unquestionably one of the best hip-hop albums ever. If anything has ever qualified as a must-buy then it is "Resurrection". In fact it was my favorite album until Mos Def's "Black on Both Sides" came out. Now I like both but in different ways. While Mos Def's C.D. is a masterpiece in it's creativity and sound, Common's is a masterpiece in it's story-telling and personality. This album seems like it's talking directly to you like nothing else I've ever heard (except maybe "One Day......") Whereas you might respect and want to meet Mos Def after hearing his album, you'll truly feel like you really know Common after listening to this.If you loved "One Day....." by Common, and are considering buying this one, but find yourself worried that it'll only seem like a let down, think again. This album in my opinion is his best work. His new one, "Like Water For Chocolate" is supposedly coming out March 2000, here's hoping that after that day I'll have a new favorite!
1	Too funky!: FOXY BROWN is my favourite Pam Grier movie (with COFFY a close second and JACKIE BROWN third). This soundtrack opens with a bang with the instrumental CHASEand then never lets up. Brimming with funk, sass and attitude, this is a 70s gem that's too good to miss.
0	* WARNING: THIS BOOK'S BEST USE IS AS A DOOR STOP! *: ...so S T O P; don't buy this book. It's Junk. Anyone who's been in the profession a while knows it because many of us received it as a Designer's Book Club intro title in the late 80's or early 90's. It wasn't worth the cost of its S&H! Ask around to people in the profession and look it over first. I received mine while having just a few years of experience in practice. Initally excited and impressed with myself having identifed a clear technical error, my feelings quickly changed to surprise and then anger as I began to realize the whole book was packed w/ errors and critical omissions. It was generally a frustratingly incompetent presentation with widely incomplete information on its proposed subjects. That the editors and publisher let this trash out, and were, I presume, making their livings with this level of incompetence was disheartening.
0	Piece of Junk: Installed this on a new build and immediately the fan started spinning loudly and to think this unit is supposed to keep things quietly. The following day, the system would not boot up at all due to a Thermal Control Module (TCM) that went bad overnight. I tried calling CoolIt Systems technical support line and someone is supposedly calling me back. Well, I been waiting for over a week now and still no return call. Will try again.
1	Excellent jazz!: Heard some of this cd on a nightly jazz program (local NPR). Ordered it immediately. it arrived early and was in excellent shape.
1	The Don Ellis "Farewell" Recording: Live at Montreux (1978) was Ellis's final recording. This recording offers reflections of the more adventurous Ellis ensemble recordings on selections such as "Future Feature," "Sporting Dance," and "Niner Two." However the disco-influenced "Go-No-Go" indicates Ellis's continued connection to popular styles. The selection "Open Wide" enjoyed some degree of popularity with its 4/4 meter and accessible main theme (somewhat reflective of Chuck Mangione's hit "Feel So Good"). Despite the conventional meter, the selection also represents an excellent example of Ellis's rhythmic superimpositions 5 beats over a 4/4 barline.Live at Montreux demonstrates a more-restrained use of Ellis's trademark "odd" meters, but makes up for it with a more-liberated use of extremely sophisticated rhythmic superimpositions.
0	Does not grab: This product does not grab hairs very well and make it very difficult to pull ingrown hairs. The point is sharp.
1	Excellent clips / very sturdy: These clips are excellent - brightly colored, high quality, and they grip onto anything.
0	Cheaper Alternative: I don't mean to be a stick in the mud, but why spend this much for 4 of these, when you can buy a huge pack (50 or more) of wooden clothespins for less than $3.00? I've been using them as chip-clips, cereal bag clips, cookbook page holders, etc. for years. and they never break. Don't buy the colored plastic ones - wood ones are best. I keep them in a little wire bin in my junk drawer, and never have to hunt.
0	IT TAKES A THIEF: AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT RUTH PRICE IS!THAT LITTLE JAZZ CLUB THAT RUTH OWNS (THAT SHE PASSES OFF AS) ANON-PROFIT ORGANIZATION IS ANYTHING BUT NON-PROFIT. I AM SO DISAPPOINTED IN THIS WOMEN WHO CALLS HERSELF A MUSICIAN, AND YET RIPS OFF EVERY MUSICIAN WHO PASSES THROUGH THE JOINT. SHE IS NOT WORTHY OF ANY FORM OF RESPECT, BECAUSE SHE HAS NO RESPECT FOR HARD WORKING STRUGGLING MUSICIANS, WHOM SHE NICKELS AND DIMES TO DEATH. THE JAZZBAKERY IS A SHAM, AND RUTH PRICE OUGHT TO HANG HER HEAD IN SHAME!
0	Low rating is for the Afterword: I admire the actual story of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde as well as the personal history and other works of Robert Louis Stevenson.This afterword, however, of Jerome Charyn's is almost more than I can bear.I'll be frank. Is this an afterword with supposed insightful information into the nuances of the story, and or the writer/period/genre, or a freakin book report. Kids, if you're buying this book for class, get this edition and don't even bother reading the actual story if you're not interested. Skip to the very back and you'll find all the multi-paragraph quotes you can handle, as well as rambling general encyclopaedic info on Robert Louis Stevenson.I think I wrote an "essay" exactly like this as a freshman in highschool english class and received a C for lack of creativity and effort. That's not exactly a compliment for you Mr. Charyn.
1	"Scary" Book: I thought this book was pretty good. This book was a great English thriller who horrified the English people in old England. I gave the book four stars because at some points it got confusing. The book was meant to be scary but today it is nothing compared to what we have today. The story is about a man name Dr. Jekyll who creats a potion to turn him into another man named Mr. Hyde so he can do his dirty work. The book is suspenseful and is a great mystery. The surprise ending and constant suspense builds this book up to be a pretty good book. This book could have been better if it had more mystery and more action. I also think the book could have been written in10 pages or less (this book is for everybody who peeks at the end before finishing). Other than that I would recomend it to mystery and horror lovers.
0	huh: Don't remember getting this. Good book regardless. Guess it was from a mobile app. Anyways I do recommend it still. Enjoy
1	A Brilliant Story! READ IT.: Stevenson draws you deeper and deeper into this chilling tale of a frightening addiction. Dr. Jekyll is a man exploring the soul, who discovers something hidden inside himself. This book weaves artfully around the always horrific subject of the evil within us all. Stevenson's beautiful language and imagery envelopes us in his mind, holding us frozen until the very last page. This story is as magnifcant as it is eerie. I loved this book. READ IT.Afterward, you may not want to look too closely into the mirror...
1	Just so you know: The book was great in my opinion. But it is slow as is the case with other books written in this time period, and it's not written from Dr. Jekyll's point of view but from his friend's. And things that are in the musical (i.e. Dr Jekyll's love interest) are not in the book. But other than that I say that it's a book everyone should read at least once. :)
1	A book that has stood the test of time: Who hasn't heard of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde? Whether it be in Newspaper reports of daily conversation, references to these two characters ensure that nearly everyone in the English speaking world has at least heard of this story. The number of people, who have read the book, is much less however and until recently I wasn't among them.Having read the book, I cannot recommend it strongly enough. Stevenson deals with the dual nature of `man' and his (or her) battle within himself. The plot is quite simple and it may have been this simplicity that gave the story its popularity. It could also have been Stevenson's skillful usage of the English language, which makes reading this book such a pleasure.The only bad thing about this book is its brevity. Do yourself a favor and read it.
1	Timeless: This is a great classic. This story brings to life the battle each one of us has within ourselves. Dr. Jekyll calls it his "dualtiy of purpose". The struggle of good versus evil; told in that colorful language of classics.
1	A Good Quick Read: Mr. Hyde is a known murderer. Dr. Jekyll is a honorable doctor in the scientific community. These people's lives should never cross, but why is Hyde the heir of Dr. Jekyll. This book by Robert Luis Stevenson "The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde", focuses on the duality of man and Jekyll's beleif that the evil in a man can be seperated from the good. This classic book can be read in as little as an hour and is a peice of literature that can surprise you in many ways. This book is not wriiten as poetry and as hard to read as The Odessy or Shakespeare. This book will make you think
0	Some parts are good: I like the demos by one of the presenters that showed some of Brian's guitar "tricks", but the rest was ho-hum.
1	the "ultimate" edition for superheroes.: I own the single books from Dini/Ross teamup. Great books. They capture the essence of each character to build upon it a very meaningful and clever tale. Nothing to add about the art: Ross is well known and always getting better and better, with panels as evocative as the prose. The hardcover edition is the perfect way to enjoy these masterpieces (even if a bit heavy to handle.....). But if you are looking for extra material (as the new edition of Mythology) you could be disappointed.
0	This Book is Nonsense: This book is misleading.According to geneticist Cavalli-Sforza's research, the genetic distance between Anglo-Saxons and the Irish is less than1. They are extremely closely related. Both northern Celtic and Germanic tribes had been closely related for a very long time. Contrast this relatedness, for example, to people who are not related. The genetic distance separating the English from the Japanese is 59. The genetic distance of the English from Sub-Saharan blacks is109.I think you get the picture.Ignatiev is unreliable as a "scholar." This is the same author who once said: "We intend to keep bashing the dead white males, and the live ones, and the females too, until the social construct known as `the white race' is destroyed,not `deconstructed' but destroyed."His hatred of European Americans (whites) belies his own research.
0	What next?: Blame a victim anyone? I will say nothing about the author's motives. Perhaps this one will be posted. Posted on 5-12-07.
1	The ratings on this book speak to how important it is...: Noel Ignatiev's well-researched and well-argued book is incredibly important to understanding the way race has been constructed in the United States and the way that white people are deeply involved in that racial hierarchy - whether they want to be or not. Looking at the reviews of the book it is clear that many of my fellow white people are incredibly uncomfortable with these realities, but their discomfort only proves the point of how important this book really is. Cycles don't change unless we interrupt them, and this book is one such interruption. Hopefully more of us will be willingly to interrupt the current cycle of white supremacy (through colonialism/capitalism/patriarchy/cis-hetero-normativity, and the white-middle-class-ideal that Ignatiev deconstructs so artfully in this book) and not defend it by turning away from the role we play in it.
1	heavenly chime: this chime has so much sound. It resonates in the air for longer than I had expected. Definetely worth the value. Good Buy! :)
0	Incorrect Movie: This was the most incorrect biography I have ever seen. It is written by a historical fictionist and is totally trying to bring Washington down. This movie was obviously an opinion. How could the author say those things about Washington. I highly recommend you don't watch it. It should not be used for children. You'll be teaching your kids incorrect things.
0	Simplified12-Step Program: We used this in my recovery group and I found it more than useless to anyone who can read at a high school level or above. It's a very simplified version of the12-step programs repackaged. Now, for adults who aren't all that literate, it may be a good book. There are a ton of examples to help explain the concepts (obviously not true examples, but written specifically for the book) and silly pictures more suited for kids, but they at least break up the blocks of reading into manageable chunks.Otherwise, it's a pass. I learned more from the bookRecovery Options: The Complete Guidethan I did during my two months in group, and its just a description of all treatment options (without being ANY treatment program). Now that's just sad.
0	spun out after only a month: I had been happily using a very inexpensive salad spinner purchased at IKEA for about ten years. It finally gave out when the plastic part on the inside began to break. I was ready to replace it and thought I might even get something that would be easier to use. I read the reviews for the OXO spinner and thought it sounded great. However, when I got it, it did not spin as well as my old one from the very beginning and by the end of the first month was spinning so slowly that the letttuce was still very damp, even after very vigourous pumping up and down of the handle. I am very disappointed with this product.
0	Sorely disappointed: This was on my wishlist for a sometime. I love salads, but hate trying in vain to dry washed lettuce with a mountain of paper towels. I finally had enough and after once again perusing the reviews, ordered what I was sure would be the answer to my wet lettuce woes. When it arrived, I immediately gave it a test drive. I was skeptical about the spinning action (as it didn't seem fast enough to be able to really spin dry), but I was still hopeful as I rinsed some lettuce, tossed it in, and plunged away. Some of the water spotted the sides of the bowl, but most of it remained on the leaves. I recalled some reviews advising throwing in a paper towel or two for drier lettuce, so I did. Still no cigar. The paper towls remained dry and the leaves wet.I simply don't understand how this product has garnered such positive reviews. After sufficiently frustrating me, this salad spinner went right back to amazon and I'm right back to drying lettuce by paper towel. Sorely, sorely disappointed.
0	Piece of Junk: This thing is a piece of junk. When you try to spin it fast enough to get the water off it jams up. Dont waste your $$$
1	Oxo Salad Spinner: Oxo Good Grips Salad SpinnerI don't know why I waited so long to order this. It's absolutely wonderful.
0	Used 3 months than it cracked!: I bought this because it was a small size for storage. First it doesn't spin out real well because of design. Second after about 8 uses the top cracked! I never put it into the dishwasher. Would I buy it again? NO. Can I return it? NO, I have owned it for 3 months.
0	order never recieved: Ordered From Amazon, They pawned it off to another company that sent it to the wrong address. when called they say it was delivered so to bad. I will never buy from AGAIN
0	Recommended cleaning resulted in broken product: I'm very disappointed by how easy it was to break the lid when trying to disassemble it GENTLY to follow the cleaning instructions provided with the product. Its spinning ability seems to deteriorate with weekly use after the first month. Cheap! I will NEVER use this model, or any OXO salad spinner again.
1	What did I do without it: I love it. I use it for all the greens we get in our "greens share." Herbs, lettuce. Easy to use. Good for storage. Very easy to clean.
0	Can't get my greens dry!: I bought this spinner because of the great reviews but I'm having a big problem in that I can't seem to get my lettuce dry. No matter how many times I've spun it there still seems to be a fair amount of visible water. Based on the reviews I expected to get "crisp, dry" lettuce. My lettuce is crisp but not dry and I'm afraid that if I put it into the fridge as is it will get bad fast.So what am I doing wrong? I've tried adding a couple (or more) paper towels - that didn't help. I've tried putting less lettuce, that didnt help either. btw I'm talking about a large salad for one person. I've also tried draining it on my drainer.If anyone knows what I should or shouldnt be doing please let me know; else I'm going to have to return it :-(Bernard
1	Salad spinner review: Very good quality spinner. Large capacity (not easy to store if you have a small kitchen) makes it easy to wash and dry two large heads of Boston lettuce. Also used to wash herbs, vegetables and fruit. The spinner lid (with the knob) is pushed down and the interior basket spins. There is a brake button to stop the spinning if you're in a hurry. There is a little lock so that you can keep the knob in the "down" position for easier storage. Also comes with a flat lid so it can be used to store other things, both refrigerated and not. The base of the bowl has a rubberized rim so that the unit won't dance all over your countertop when you spin the contents. Solid construction and well engineered.
0	OXO OKO: The spinner works well, but be sure you have enought room to store it. I haven't used a spinner before and found it to be large, clunky, and hard to store.
1	Great Spinner - could use a seperate lid: I originally purchased this salad spinner back in 2006 and used it regularly. A few weeks ago, it finally broke (probably just wear & tear). I bought the same one (with clear lid) and using it again. Nothing much changes in the last years except use of clear plastics.My only recommendation would be for OXO to include a flat plastic lid. I usually keep my salad in the spinner (fridge) once washed, but the shape of the lid makes it take a lot of space in fridge and won't allow staking.
1	Take your salad for a spin...: This is a great kitchen item to have, it really gets out the extra water and allows your favorite dressing to cling to the salad. A must have at a great price.
1	Really good product!: Great salad spinner! Sooo much better than my electric one. The bottom stays still while spinning. And it really gets all the water off my lettuce.
1	friends request an it was perfect: it was just what she wanted and came fast. she had not been able to find it anywhere in local stores
1	outstanding spinner!!!!: I LOVE MY SALADS!! I;M VERY PICKY ABOUT WASHING MY SPINACH BEFORE I CREATE MY SALAD. THIS OXO IS ONE OF THE GREATEST SPINNERSI EVER USED . IF YOU LIKE SALADS LIKE I DO . YOU NEED TO GET THIS OXO LETTACE SPINNER.C.INFUSINOCHICAGOLAND
1	A great way to spin sprouts: My primary purpose for this purchase was to spin sprouts. Seems silly, but my other spinners were unsuitable due to the hole size. This is easy to use and doesn't take up too much space in the cupboard. For more info on using a spinner for the sprouts, visit sproutpeople.org
0	Not A Great Way To Get Acquainted With The Pixies: "Surfer Rosa" and "Doolittle" are much better introductions to the Pixies. I'm sure a lot of people new to the group enjoy this compilation, but it's nowhere near as cohesive or brilliant as those early masterpiece albums, which are filled to the brim with awesome material and arranged perfectly. In fact, Death To The Pixies puts too much focus on some of their lesser, later work. Disc Two, the live portion, is a nice show but it's a shame for Pixies fans to have to shell out extra cash for the accompanying 'best of' CD just to get it.I give it two stars because the music is good, but the arrangement is not. Pixies were an album band, and compilations only degrade their impact.
1	This band is amazing: This album has everything and more. This is a complilation of some of the best Pixie songs ever written, and Kim Deal with her ever so intoxicating voice kicks ass.
1	Good vibrations: The sound of these chimes is soothing and very rich for the size of the unit. I am very pleased with the mood that it sets.
1	It will be hard to beat this one.: This is my favorite CD, and I highly reccomend it. What I think is the theme that really holds this soundtrack together is the ark theme. It is very atmospheric, creepy and interesting. In the movie there is a big popularity over the ark, but Indiana Jones is probably the only one to realize that it could be dangerous and this theme perfectly defines how mysterious this object is. The moral of this movie is leave God alone, and in the end of the movie you'll see why. Now I'm talking about the new digitally remastered version that is really good and I found out that most of the tracks were previously unreleased and I don't know how this soundtrack could be a soundtrack without those tracksDesert Chase has the best chase scene music ever. If you like John Williams, take my advice.
0	I Admire West Point, But This Does Not Live Up To The Hype: I was disappointed. After all the hype, I thought this was a substantial work, but it isn't. It is mostly pictures. The pictures are nice but it offers nothing, and text-wise, not enough of it for the price. I'm sorry to say this about Westpoint, but I somewhat resent being misled. It could have taken me but 5 minutes to flip through it at a bookstore to see it was not for me.
1	What scares the hell out of *you*?: "Scare Tactics" is bone-chilling and creepy. Without much ado it grabs you by its deadly fascination right from the start and will not let you go until you turn to the final page. With colourful descriptions, which will vivily live in your imagination for some time, Elizabeth Manz manages to draw the reader into this world of fear, suspense and horror. I worked out theories what might happen on the next page but I was wrong all the time. A powerful language carries on with the story, makes you suffer with and fear for the main characters. "Scare Tactics" is excatly that what the title promises. I highly recommend this book simly because it scared the hell out of *me*.
0	This book was not helpful in preparing my driving tour.: We purchased this book in preparation for a road trip in Spain. The maps have no detail and serve no real purpose. The descriptions of locations and drives are scanty and the photos look about 25 years old. This time, the cover sold the book and the inside does not live up to it!
1	PSX best console ever!: The Playstation is by far the best console that i have ever played, sure the N64 is good and some of my friends say it's the best but none of it's game are nearly as lastable or as overall good compared to playstation (except some gun games such as Golden eye) i don't have a playstation yet though i am getting one very soon. You might not think i have a strong view point on the matter as i don't own one but i have certainly played them alot at friends houses and stuff, for instance i was at my friends house once and i was sleeping over and we played tony hawke's pro skateboarding for about 6 hours straight. Although i have yet to to play dream cast and PSX2 is not yet out in my country i believe that PSX1 is a masterpiece. my opinion Jamieson
1	I think that this game console is one of the best!: I thought that this game console has great graphics and the amount of entertainment and fun theat you can get out of your money i amazing. Although it is slower than nintendo 64, playstation can give you better graphics and more reality. The new sega dreamcast seems like it is a waste of money compared to playstation it is just expensive and pathetic. Playstation is priced reasonably and the games are not sixty dollars. I would reccomend playstation to anyone. Nintendo and dreamcast sound like fun but are not as easy on your wallet!
1	PSX: Still the best option: The PlayStation has been beaten out in the hardware race by the PC, Sega Dreamcast, and [some say] the N64. However, the PlayStation is still the best overall system on the market.There is no better deal, and the N64 can only match this price, not better it. Also, the CDs the PSX uses are much cheaper than the cartridges of the N64. This system is the most inexpensive to own and use.Secondly, the games are as good or better than those of other systems. For the Mario, Zelda, and F-Zero of N64, Sony has Gran Turismo1 and 2, the Syphon Filters, the Resident Evil series, Metal Gear Solid, Final Fantasies, Dino Crisis, Tekkens .. more of the best games are still only on PlayStation.
1	Very fun system with lots to do!: This is a very good system to have. It provides many, many hours of entertainment for all ages. It is strong and durable too. If it is on with no game, there is also a memory card or CD player possibility. There are many features and options available. This is a great system and a must get.
0	BJBichon on "My Parrot, My Friend": This book was recommended by another bird site as the only book you will ever need to understand your bird. I think I was expecting too much. It reads a little like a clinical tome; too many words, too little said. Yet, the monochromatic photos and diagrams, editing errors, and misspelled words cause you to question the credibility.
1	I love this coring set!: The corer is wonderful. It takes some pressure from the user to work (obviously) but it cuts the apple into perfect sections and the corer itself cleans up very easily. We are very happy with our purchase.
1	Not all Christmas-themed, but still nice for the holidays: ---------------------------------------------------"Angelina Ballerina Holiday Gift Set"(Hit Entertainment, 2011)---------------------------------------------------This 3-DVD box set is billed as a holiday collection, although not all of the episodes are Christmas related. It includes on holiday episode, "The Nutcracker Sweet," but also a bunch of regular old Angelina episodes where she tries out for big parts and learns to get along with family and friends. We were big fans of the original Angelina Ballerina books, though the videos didn't have quite the same feel. But if you're searching for a present for younger girly-girl Angelina fan, this set has a lot of content - over three hours worth of stories! (DJ Joe Sixpack, ReadThatAgain children's media reviews)
0	CCR OPD: This is one bad album from the once great band. Well, as a quartet C.C.R. never made a bad album, but as a trio; they stunk! The trios live album "Live In Europe" was a fake (see my review) and their one studio work was a bad joke. I bet Tom Fogerty was laughing at this release.

0	Agree with previous reviewer: I also have a problem with this holster not staying on my person. Although, my problem with the holster is that I have it clipped to my belt but the holster sometimes comes off by itself and I blame this on the design. All you have to do to get the case off is turn it 90 degrees and pull up. I have a PDA case with a similar design but it requires you to push a lever to have the case come off and it has never accidentally come of because of that lever. I have had the Siemens case come off many times when I was sitting and yesterday it came off on the street when I was reaching for something. It's a good thing a good samaritan found my phone and contacted me or else I would be out a phone. This is a good case if you don't plan on keeping the case on your belt but if you do I would look for something else. I currently have a Krusell case on order to replace this one. After yesterday's incident I don't plan on using it anymore.
1	Great quality: What can you say about OXO products, they're great. These are easy to use, go in the dishwasher for complete cleaning and are easy to handle. If they break or if there is an issue, OXO stands behind their products.
1	Would buy again..: I use tongs for just about everything I do in the kitchen. The rubber handles make these tongs one of my top rated kitchen items. They can get greasy or wet and they still won't slip. Another bonus to is that the rubber on these help heat and cold resistance. I use this alot to turn food in the oven and they haven't burned me once. They also grab small items, that my other tongs have a problem grabing.The one thing I don't like about these tongs is the way they lock. You have to pull on the bottom to lock them. And push in to open. On my other tongs, there is a clasp that slides up and down the handle, those are much easier to use while cooking. With these you have to use two hands to close. One to hold the handle and the other to pull the little clasp thingy closed. Doesn't sound like a big deal, until you're cooking and in a hurry and trying to close them while getting food out of the oven or whatnot.But given the chance, I would buy them again.
1	Sturdy with a great locking mechanisim: These tongs a little more expensive, but they won't "twist" on you the way that cheaper tongs will when you try to pick up and flip a heavier item. The great locking mechanisim, which means never having to deal with sliding rings again, is worth the price of admission. I've used these tongs (and their longer16" cousins) for everything, including grill duty, for about 3 years and they're just as good as new.
0	Does not live up to expectation: I'm a big fan of OXO Good Grips products -- my peeler, ice cream scooper and wine opener have served me well. This can opener was my latest purchse, and it has not lived up to the OXO name. After a few uses the blade seemed to lose its sharpness. After probably less than 50 uses, the can opened failed to work complete (blade become misaligned, perhaps). Next time it's back to the Zyliss for me!
0	Lock broke, but it's still comfortable: I'm glad to know I'm not the only one with a busted lock -- lasted maybe1-2 months. However, true to Oxo form, the handles are still much more comfortable than any other can opener I've used (thus, 2 stars instead of1).
1	delivered as described: I bought this book for my son who is reading it in school. It was in the condition described. Used very good. The kids in his class seem to like the book. Bandix delivered it quickly
1	A very funny book.: I think this is a great book to read. I enjoyed it a lot. Kids should read this book because it is funny when Matilda uses her powers. It is about a little girl who wants to go to school but her father won't let her. So she plays jokes on him with her powers until he finally lets her go to school.
1	Praise for Matilda: I would give four stars to Matilda by Roald Dahl. This book is a 4 star book because it was very interesting but not the best book I have read.Matilda is a genius child with idiotic parents who are very mean to her. They do not care about Matilda at all they think she is not intelligent and that they are. At school Matilda has to deal with Miss "The" Trunchbull, a very cruel and horrid headmistress with an attitude. The only comfort Matilda has is her teacher Miss Honey and they share a very big secret about Matilda. I very much like this book but as I said it is not my favorite book. I like books more like "The Hunger Games" and "A Series Of Unfortunate Events" Roald Dahl is a very gifted writer who has many other funny children's stories. Books I recommend by Roald Dahl: "James And The Giant Peach ", "Matilda", "The Twits", "The BFG". My favorite part of this book was when Matilda put the super glue in her dad's hat.
1	Matilda: Do you know some one who is smart and could do magic? I read the book Matilda. It was about a girl named Matilda. She was very smart and she was magical. It all happened in Worn wood's house. Every morning Matilda's mom would go to bingo and her brother would go to school every morning. Her mom would leave her alone. By that time she would know how to take care of herself. As you can see her mom would not take care of her. When she turned 4 years old she already knew how to read. Matilda's dad would work as a crook and he didn't care about school or reading a book instead he would stay watching T.V. I recommend this book because it is an interesting book and a funny book. I don't want to give the rest so if you want to find more about the book why don't you read the book!
1	Great story: Such a great story for little girls today. It's not about being the prettiest girl or having an attitude, but about adventure and standing up for yourself. Highly recommended.
1	Matilda: I think this is a great book for kids at age10 to13 or14. I really like this book because it is very interesting and magical.I think that it is much better than the movie or DVD because it has some different information than the movie. I don't understand why they change some parts from the book into the movie. Well any ways Matilda is a very great, interesting, and magical book.By:Ashley
1	The Ups and Downs of Matilda: Matilda was a very smart girl and learned to read much faster than the other kids. She acctually wanted to go to school, but when she got there, she found her worst enemy, the Trunchbull. Matilda used her mental powers to get rid of the Trunchbull. The book was sad because of the way her parents treaded her, but it was good how Ms. Honey and Matilda became friends
1	Really nice fit. Simple as that.: I'm super peculiar when it comes to Jeans. I can't stand anything that's skin-tight. Can't stand inseams that squeeze my ... gonads. But I'm not into the ultra saggy, baggy look either. So, it's pretty damn impossible for me to buy a pair of jeans. Recently I bought a similar model to this one at local retailer and was very much impressed with the look and fit. As soon as I realized that after so long I had found a pair of jeans that met my needs I came to amazon to buy these. Son, I'm not disappoint. These jeans fit nicely. Very nice as a matter of fact. lots of leg room, nice inseam length, and nice fit from the waist to the end of your pockets. If you got yourself a small beer belly, I highly suggest buying one full size larger than you usually get. Otherwise, at least for me, these jeans are perfect.
0	aunt bam's: The quality of the dvd was excellent, but that was not one of tyler's best works. The movie wasn't as funny as some of his other movies or plays.
0	No No and No.: Ok. I never cared too much for Aunt Bam simply because she is soo freakin loud! All the time! Trying too darn hard to be funny! I decided to be more open minded but that was an epic FAIL. I don't know if I am just outgrowing stage plays but I am pretty sure it's the character Aunt Bam throwing me off with her loudness. Not all black aunts are loud and obnoxious. Bring it down a couple notches.
1	great message: great job Tyler loved this. this is a great play that a lot of single moms needs to see if some ppl stop putting so much energy into their ex life maybe they can move on with life
0	Too Firm, too obstructive.: There may be some situation where this product may work well, but in a shower it does not. The handle is so curved that it obstructs contact with the glass. The rubber part of the squeegee is also very firm which doesn't allow full contact with the glass. I wouldn't recommend.
1	WHATS REALLY GOIN ON!: THE BEST OF ALL TIMES (AND TO THINK THIS WAS RELEASED JUST 7 DAYS AFTER I WAS BORN)! THE ALBUM COVER SAYS IT ALL.
1	Such A Rich History Behind This Release -- A MUST HAVE: As a huge Marvin Gaye fan, I have virtually everything he released. And although I have the original versions of "I Want You" and "What's Going On", I didn't have the deluxe editions. After reading Michael Eric Dyson's "Mercy Mercy Me (The Art and Demons of Marvin Gaye)", (in part of which he gives an in depth look at how these deluxe editions came about), I decided that I needed to have them. After learning the history behind the releases of these editions, I am awestruck. Both are truly timeless classics, works of art that cannot be dismissed. Now that these have been published, I hope that a whole new generation of folks are enlightened to Mr. Gaye's genius.
1	to all haterz: who ever alblum was lame ur lame to that dude said this worst album 2 u eat a fat d**k
1	More than a woman...!: Aaliyah is more than a woman! She's an angel! Her voice, and music is great. I reccomend you buy this C.D. today!My favorite songs?: More than a woman, and Rock the boat!
1	Aaliyah's Best Album Ever!!: I've always been a fan of Aaliyah. Her personnality seemed so down to earth. Through the years I watched her grow from a young teen into a beautiful woman. You never really heard much about her personnal life because she wasn't the type to put herself out there like that. That's what I loved about her the most. She always stayed on the "DOWN LOW." Her third album is the best album ever. From beginning to end. Even though I never met her I wish I could of had the chance to tell her how much her music changed my life and how proud I was of her.You will be deeply missed LIYAH! R.I.P. Babygirl.
1	Girl to Woman: Aaliyah has definitely grown up. The songs are about love, hurt, pain, sex...etc. The songs are more sensual than her usual style. My favorite track is "Rock the boat", then "I care for you", then "I Refuse". I am a huge Aaliyah fan.... Keep up the good work baby girl...........
0	good singles but this is album is lacking!: i Think Aaliyah is talented but i would not call this album one of the best cd's i've ever heard. although the songs like "rock the boat" and "more than a woman" are really good the rest of the album is (sorry Aaliyah)very lacking, i could even call alot of the songs fillers. I don't think this cd is worth the money, my advice is to get the singles or download the good songs off the filesharing service.ps. i hope they bring out a best of or greatest hits Aaliyah cd, coz i'll be getting that one if it comes out.
1	"A" Is For Aaliyah!!!: How should I say this? Aaliyah has come a long way since the year of1994 with her debut album, "Age Ain't Nothing But A Number" and since then, she's been a wonderful female singer who was down to earth and beautiful. With this album "AALIYAH", she has done a fantastic job on recording this album with each track that are Cool and lovely, and her voice is just remarkable, and the song "We Need A Resolution" (featuring Timbaland), is awesome, and it is one of the best tracks on this album "AALIYAH".
1	Aaliyah at her best: This CD truly shows Aaliyah at her very best. Her trademark fallseto voice is displayed, along with a vocal range that I never knew that she posessessed. I thoroughly enjoyed every song on this album, but my favorites are "More than a Woman", "Rock the Boat", and "Resoulution". I fell in love with Aaliyah when I listened to the song "Try Again", and this album goes well above and beyond what I expected. Though Aaliyah is not with us anymore, I know that she knew this CD was her best.
1	BANGIN BEATS: This album was a great contribution to the current state of music. Aaliyah's music was never one to be in the normalcy but she really blew us away with this album. She showed us her womanly attitudes and she shared her sexiness with us in a real classy way. I like this album and will keep it in the stereo for a while.
0	keepin it real: Yo she was an o.k. singer, but she was no acter. Her new c.d. was wack and everyone knows that. Just because she is no longer with us everyone feels the need to lie and not keep it real. She was tight nahh I'm lying, she was wack and couldn't write a song at all. I think every hit song was written by someone else. She never did tell the truth about her and R.Kelly, that is when she was tight. RIP---Aaliyah
0	Is he running out of subjects to write books on: This author has over 20 different books. I have read afew and found them to be consistant in quality, that being low, very low. I find it hard to believe that mortimer is an expert in all these programs (after effects, lightwave, 3d max, poser, bryce, ect.)but it is realistic to assume that he mediocre on all of them. Spend your money on a professional who uses the product every day, rather then on some guy who opened up the program the day before his book was due to the publisher.
0	Stuffy: Published in1955 - I have never ever cared for this volume and until I read The Mystery of The Aztec Warrior thought it was the worst in the series. To me I always found it a suffocating book and I can't explain why. Tony plays a prominent role in this one and to the books credit at least they encounter the criminals a fair amount and there is a little action. The latter chapters were fairly decent. Its worth reading - once -but honestly compared to the other volumes in my opinion this is among the cellar dwellers. (Almost a 2 Star - but not quite) RATED D
1	Woodstock Emperor Gong Chime: This wind chime is beautifully constructed of high quality materials. It has a very low, zen-like chime and would be a wonderful addition to any garden or home.
1	Blazing hot: Of all the young artists who are now over produced, canned and sent forth, Kelly Osbourne rises above with this album. Her strong, emotional voice and the witty, gritty writing of the material she chose makes a strong statement. The talented studio artists give her the stage she needs to shine. Not just the daughter of an icon, Kelly has her own major talent and career ahead. Go girl, rock forth.
1	Real Music !!!! and an amazingly gifted Singer---GREAT CD !!!: I have been so disappointed in music lately....drum machines on top of drum loops...and rehashed samples...etc....hardly any "real" musicians on most current popular music....basically music with no soul or feeling to it.....This new CD by the Brand New Heavies is just what the current state of music needs right now !!!! A real band, with an amzingly talented singer- N'Dea Davenport. N'Dea sounds great, and the band and tracks are funky as hell ! IF you are a Brand New Heavies fan you will not be disappointed...if you never listened to the Brand New Heavies before, buy this CD and get educated oh how "Real" music sounds and feels !
0	Not good for scrubbing: Too soft, reach bottom of container but brush is so soft at tip make cleaning very difficult. Would not buy
1	Amazing brush: I started using this as a general pre dishwasher scrub brush based on another Amazon review I saw on this product. I also use it to clean the sink and to clean out my recycling cans and bottles. It is the best overall cleaning brush I have ever used. The long flexible handle allows access to almost any item. I pop it in the dishwasher periodically and even the most stubborn food items come off - things like scrambled eggs and bread dough. It has held up well under heavy daily use for the last three months. And that is a record for me as I'm pretty hard on cleaning tools. I just added it as a permanent item on my shopping list.
1	Extra arm!: It reaches where my arm can't, cracks and cranies and does it throughly without any after taste or film to alter the drink.
1	Cleaning was never so easy: My wife always had issues while cleaning my stainless steel thermos that I take to office filled with coffee. The opening is so small that washing it becomes a pain. The other day she was telling me about the OXO good grips bottle brush; she is able to clean my thermos without any worry. The bristles are soft yet firm on the base and side walls that it does not leave any scratch. Even after repeated use the brittles remain firm and have not lost its shape. The handle has a decent grip and despite using with soap does not slip. The length is also pretty convenient for cleaning elongated bottles. It is a must have in any household.
1	Soft and Flexible: I finally got my old Nalgene bottle cleaned out that has been hiding at the back of my cupboard with this great brush. I thought the bottle WAS clean until I saw that the slightly cloudy film that was on the very bottom was not there anymore. I couldn't be happier knowing that I won't be drinking anymore germs or excess cleaning products that failed to rinse. When this one wears out I will purchase another.
1	Great bottle brush!: I needed a brush to clean the inside of my Takeya water bottle. This brush did the trick. It feels good in your hands, cleans very well, and it's of great quality. If you're looking for a bottle brush, look no further...snap this up at this great price!
1	Bottle Brush: I needed a bottle brush for my water bottles that I take to work and to the gym. This product is just right. It has the perfect length and the brush bristles aren't to coarse.
1	Hank just can't seem to win: Hank, the Head of Ranch Security, is troubled by Eddy the Rac. Eddy is the newest addition at the ranch. Hank always seems to end up on the bad end of "moonlight madness". Will this cowdog and strange acting racoon ever see eye to eye? This is a very entertaining story; it will make you giggle and laugh out loud.
0	Not the least bit entertaining: David Harum is an old guy who loves to tell long, drawnout stories about nothing in particular. The author writes Harum's stories in dialect, a pet peeve of mine. It would be endurable if the stories had anything to do with anything, but most of the time they don't. There's even a long, drawn-out story of Harum telling a long, drawn-out story! I'm doubly damned. There's a secondary character of John Lennox. We get a brief glimpse of his story and the cold fish he ends up with, but his main purpose in the book is to be the audience for Harum's tall tales. I don't recommend this book at all.
1	Home Owner: This was great, hands down the best one I have installed.Seems faster then all the others I had before filling the tank.Was also very easy to install, it was harder getting the old one out for me!Very nice product and even greater price. Five star rateing for sure.
1	Good Material, Lacking Translations: I picked this up since it had pretty favorable reviews. Having finished it I can say it was worthwhile to buy. There are a lot of good tips and advice for writing stories regardless of genre. I'm not even sure why it's labeled as "Shojo" outside of being part of a series since the tips are applicable for all genres. It's divided into short easily-digestible chapters that you can try out once you're done and it does a good job building on ideas each chapter. My only caveat is that the translation isn't very good in places and some phrases come off as too generic or repetitive. While reading it I kept feeling like there was probably more subtle aspects to each lesson that didn't make it through translation.
0	Felt Scatterbrained.: I felt the booked lacked a lot. The art was great but i learned nothing from the book in regards to writing. I was expecting something a bit more descriptive and was disappointed. I would not recommend this book to anyone.
0	Really, really, boring repetitive low-key techno: On it's own, this record may be (barely) decent, but compared to Gus Gus' other efforts it is surprisingly lame, boring, monotonous, unoriginal, etc. I know it's their earlier work, and perhaps they were ahead of their time--but instead of appreciating their "roots" it's much more enjoyable to listen to their more developed recordings. This CD has no standout tracks, save for "purple", which was already released on their other records. This CD does not seem like a "Gus Gus" CD--it could be anybody making mediocre techno music with a synthesizer and boring samples. Buyers beware, for die-hard fans only...
0	Not the best!: Loved the film when it first came out and have seen it many times since. There is only one song on this CD that creates the excitement experienced when you watch the movie, You're The Best, and for me, it was worth getting the CD for just that song.
0	Piece of Junk: This stapler is not worth a penny. It constantly jams. Every time I reload, it takes about10 jams and half of the new clip of staples until it starts working. And yes, I am using genuine Arrow T50 staples for reloads. I know this is the only stapler like it on the market, but you would be better off with a hammer and a box of staples. Save your $20
0	paperweight: Garbage, utter garbage. I've had every incarnation of Arrow stapler, from the classic to the "upper end" models and they ALL FAIL shortly after purchase even with Arrow brand staples.
0	If you buy this staple gun buy a hammer also: I bought this staple gun because staples are not being made for my 40+ year old Bostitch any longer, and this stapler seems to be one of the few choice around. I am really disappointed. It does not seat the staples like my old Bostitch, so I end up driving most of them home with a hammer. This stapler is poorly designed since the amount of pressure needed to shoot staple does not result in a seated staple. My old Bostitch was easy to push and still seated the staples.
0	Totally useless: Purchased this a few weeks ago to clean tile grout.Bristles bent out of shape after a short time.OXO usually makes good products but not this one.A loser.
1	Use for dishes: The best brush I've ever had to clean food off dishes and pots before washing. After a year, it still works well and looks pretty good.
1	This book rocks!: The authors have a refreshing collective voice, and it's so great to finally be encouraged, rather than be told the usual statistic, 'only 30% of women have orgasms-- you should just be content as you are.' I am so thankful that I found this book by chance; I'm buying copies for friends already.
0	A complete waste of time: This is a terrible book. What little it does tell you, it repeats over and over and over and over... The tiny amount of information to be gleaned from this amateur attempt at insight into female sexuality could have been paraphrased in three sentences.1) Don't be afraid of asking for what you want. 2) Sex is better when the woman has orgasmed first and 3) You deserve it! Get a life women and figure it out on your own.
1	Good quality, molded plug: The plug is molded, which is great. It is very substantial and well made.Each wire is rated correctly (neutral and12v for example being a heavier gauge than the turn signal).I would buy again
1	this is NOT PERFORMED BY THE VILLAGE PEOPLE: all other songs are sung by the familiar artists, but YMCA is NOT PERFORMED BY THE VILLAGE PEOPLE. Some woman I haven't heard of sings it, albeit somewhat satisfactorily.
1	son's movie: The family enjoys this movie, so much my son got a guinea pig. He named it Darwin. Its a very enjoyable kids movie.
0	If You Hate Your Kids: Smells Worse Than a Dirty Hamster Cage...: Wait, stop! I know what you are thinking: "This film is obviously bad, why on Earth did you watch it?"Now, this film could have worked, if the correct approach was taken. Nope, I don't know what that approach would be; but this film took the wrong one. The cheesy jokes, the bad acting, and the ridiculous story all contribute to this film's failure.Sadly, I watched the entire film, and the last few parts were the worst. Giant explosions and a giant robot attack the wise-cracking guinea pigs. But thisscene was actually kind of boring.skip it.
1	LOVED IT: Yes im a Grandma....but I bought this for me.....I do have GP's as pets as well.....and I can see there personalities as is the case in this fun film......I really enjoy watching it and it brings lots of laughs and so do a couple of my friends enjoy it as well.yes the grandkids will watch it with me, .this is just a fun movie and I cant wait for more sequels to come out.....B.W.
0	Phew...This movie stinks: Well, on the positive side this movie was clean without too much crude humor. Of course it had the gas passing humor that you find in most films of this genre. Negatively speaking this has to be one of the most boring and stupid movies that I have ever seen. It just was lacking something. I never really cared if the rodents suceeded in their mission or not.
0	Bad Oxo Product: We love OXO products, but this one is not one of them. Shrimps get mangled. Might be good for very large shrimp though, but not for medium ones. My wife found it faster to just use her nails.
0	Don't buy this one!: The first 2 songs are good indeed, but all the others are super-kitsch, really horrible, over, disgusting! Try to find the right CDs from this master. I had read the other reviews and bought this one, and now I feel like throwing it through the window.
1	Never leaves my side: I tend to over-stuff the front pockets and the flap does not alwaysvelcro close. But I tend to carry too much stuff.The unit is a great utility pouch and holds up well.
1	Definitely a "Good Grip": I have and have used at least15 other vegetable brushes. All for the most part were decent. The OXO is a step above most but not perfect. The size is great for a small to medium size hand and adequate for a larger hand. The bristles are firm, great for potatoes, carrots, etc. I would recommend a second, softer brush for more delicate fruits and vegetables. Combined with a vegetable wash likeFit Fruit & Vegetable Wash, Soaker/Refill Bottle, 32-Ounce Units (Pack of 3)and you have an excellent1-2 knockout punch for dirt, pesticides, bacteria, etc. Once you see the difference in just how clean your fruits and veggies are after you utilize your new secret weapons, you wont go back to hand rubbing, guaranteed!
1	Great for even bigger hands: Once my family started eating a lot of potatoes and sweet potatoes I found it necessary to purchase a good scrub brush as we like to leave the skin on.This is great, really cleans the potatoes and other root vegetables really well. Easy to clean and easy to use even for someone with XL hands like myself.OXO has yet to disappoint me.
1	easy to grasp vegetable brush: large size of brush, makes it very easy to hold while cleaning vegetables. bristles are not too stiff, nor too soft.
1	Nice Brush: This brush is not your basic veggie brush. It fits nicely in my hands and it's rubberized grip is fantastic and non slip. The bristles are softer than many I have used, yet stiff enough to clean the biggest potatos and carrots. Sometimes with my other veggie brush my hand would get cramped. Your probably wondering... "How many veggies must that guy scrub if his hand gets cramped?" Well, I scrub lots of veggies- I am a professional scrubber. Anyway, this brush sure gets those vegetables clean.
1	I am glad i made this purchase.: Probably the luckiest dollars i have used to purchase this vegetable brush. It's worth every penny. Just buy it, you won't regret it. I used some other vegetable brushes they are not even worth comparing to OXO quality.
1	GOod, but sometimes cheesy: In each track of this album, there's a different band formation, composed of Gary's guest musicians like Glenn Hughes, Neil Carter & Phil Lynott. It contains big sucess of his career, like "Out in the Fields" and "Military Man". It's an irregular record, however, and it's not on of his best. THe subsequent "Wild Frontier" is more coherent.
0	Horrible: Used this cutting board for 8 days before it warped. Rolls all over the cabinet now.Don't buy......get a plastic board or the cutting sheets that sell for about $1.00
1	Interesting book: This is an interesting book. I like the three different voices she uses to narrate the three different worlds, and the way the most advanced world, being the most self-aware, is done in first person.Interesting questions are raised and about truth, right/wrong, etc. I do not agree with everything the author seems to believe, but this book would be a good springboard for discussion of questions like, "What is truth?" and "What/who is God?" and "Is there anything beyond what we can see and study with traditional science?"There are a lot of other interesting questions that can be pondered that the book raises but does not answer. For instance, was Alana's father exploiting her young heart and propensity to fall in love in order to save the world of Andrecia and, if so, is that a morally defensible thing?Not the absolute best book I have ever read, but worth reading, and probably worth reading more than once.
