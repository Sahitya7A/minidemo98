1	Worth watching: The movie was well done and dramatic. The acting was good, although one could tell it was sectarian.My one main criticism is that the story did not portray the decisive factor in Luther's conversion - Justification by faith alone - sufficiently. This was the lynchpin and pivotal doctrine that separated Luther from the Catholic church and the papacy.
1	Great Movie: Very enjoyable movie that is rather accurate historically on the big points. It showed Luther as a man tormented by his demons as he tried to stay faithful to the Word of God.
0	Luther movie (VHS): As the teacher of a women's Bible class in a Lutheran church, I showed this movieLuther [VHS] after the class had completed six weeks of study on Dr. Martin Luther's life and influence on the Protestant Reformation. I would highly recommend this product because it stays true to historical facts and is not "padded" for today's audiences.
1	Good Movie: This is a good movie and a decent portrayal of Luther. The plot is well done for the volumes of information covered, the acting is adequate, and the costumes are outstanding.Some of the actors' personal beliefs portions of the historical representations and the film is definitely from the perspective of the Lutheran Church. While relatively ballanced, one must still keep the presuppositions of those who created it in mind when viewing the historical material.The producers could have expounded on some additional elements in the time period that were directly related that might have helped a bit more in keeping the bias level less apparent, but the film definitely falls way short of being the 'Protestant Propoganda' some critics have labeled it.While not your Saturday Night Date flic, it is most assuredly a well done film and worth watching.
1	Very accurate: This is a very accurate presentation of Luther and the events that happened. I have read a couple of church history books and this movie is almost verbatem.
1	Teacher: I am teaching some young preachers from out of my church and personally used this book when in Bible college over 35 years ago. It is a great book, very detailed with information that will help any young or older preacher know more about his ministry and how to perform it.
0	It Broke after1 month's use: Worked well at first, then a rubber band broke and I could not fix it, piece of junk!
0	bally ab tightener: piece of junk...a toy compared to 60 second ab machine.broke so quickly, and i am 59 and weigh only116...what a rip off...makes me want to cry for my loss!!!!!!!!!!
1	LOOKS REAL!: I ADORE IT! I HAVE A SIZE 5 RING FINGER AND IT LOOKS GREAT ON. THIS RING CAN FOOL YOU THAT IT COULD BE REAL. THE METAL HAS NOT TARNISHED OR TURNED MY FINGER COLORS AND SO I FEEL IT WAS A GOOD BUY.
1	Bigger Than I Expected: If you are looking for a ring with a dainty stone this isn't the one. This ring has a ROCK. I wasn't expecting the stone to be so big, but now that I have worn it for a little while, and gotten used to it, I love it. It is beautifully made and very shiny. Looks expensive.
1	very detailed account of Nureyev's life: Although verbose and extremely detailed, still enjoyable and a fast read. In just100 pages I feel I've come to know so much about Nureyev's life and the passion that drove him to become the world's most famous ballet dancer.
0	Doesn't work.: Trust me, guys, this doesn't work unless you're a stud. It's all based on making "eye contact", and no girl is gonna be giving you 'eye contact" unless you're an attractive stud. For the average joe, forget it, this just does not happen in real life.
0	PUA Book Order (The System): Small book with somewhat large type, not finished reading it, and not really buying into it yet (maybe too soon to tell).My Amazon purchase included 3-publications (similar ilk). Within a very short time (minutes) of making the online purchase, there was an identity hack against my credit card. Coincidence?I'm reconsidering making future purchases through Amazon.
0	The System: How to get ripped off today!!: The entire contents of this book could fit on one page of paper.The remainder of the book is filled with art and babble. There's even recipes in the back (not kidding).Do not buy this book unless you want to learn first hand how to get ripped off today.
0	Buddha-Lounge: As bland as white bread. It is a misrepresentation to link this series of 3 CDs in any way to the Buddha Bar CDs or the chillout music category in general. It could play in the background without anyone ever raising their head or moving their body. If your thing is New Age music this might be for you. Everyone else is forewarned.
0	Total waste of money!: It is way too hard to get this stuff off after use! If you happen to touch anything but your body, it is on there for good. The bottle itself develops a super greasy feel immediately after the first use. Go with the ID Glide water based lube instead. Millennium costs twice as much, is a total mess, and doesn't feel nearly as good. My GF hates this stuff too so it was a total loss!
0	Returned: Couldn't get enough channels (even with purchase of an external antenna) to make it worth the price.
0	Without their Kabuki face makeup, Kiss would be nowhere.: Kiss is a lame band with their image only covering for their many songs with inane lyrics with their makeup and concerts. They could'nt write a song if their lives depended on it. If you want metal, buy a Metallica CD. If you want moronic disgiuses and Cd titles like "Psycho-Circus" buy KISS.By the way, only the dumbest band in the world would try to get cash by getting Tood MacFarlane to create a series of comic books and action figures!
0	WOW: If everyone actually listens to the words in all the songs they will see that each has a special meaning that deals with real life. Not exactly like the KISS of 20 years ago but things do change. Cd song quality is excellent. Thumbs up guys!!!!!!!!!!!!
0	SOFT AND PREDICTABLE: The attempt to make another Destroyer fell very short. The title track is easily the best song on this album. It was obvious right away that Peter Criss wasn't playing on it....he does't have that kind of talent so why go in and make this album at all? Before it even came out you knew that Peter would be singing a ballad. "I Finally Found My Way" is no "Beth" or "Hard Luck Woman." The rest of it is just too soft. There is no heavy drum sound. It almost like a weak Lick It Up minus the better songs. Get back with Eric and Bruce! Don't worry about makinganother Destroyer. I'll be satisfied with another Revenge.
0	Classic Kiss? Nope!: Disappointing. I haven't listened to this album since I bought it. Yes, I like Kiss, But this album just doesn't do anything for me. They should have recorded another "Destroyer", "Rock And Roll Over", etc, But this is not the case here. Save your money.
1	i give it a solid 4 stars: I think this is a solid kiss album.about 4 of the songs stand out as some of my favorites.i just listened to it after about 4 years the only thing i hate is the sound quality.the highs are tinny and the bass is so flat.but i guess thats cds for ya!i wish this came out on vinyl!
0	Pandering to "new" fans.: I made the mistake of buying this album having not heard any of the songs, and only being a faithful fan of Kiss. Yeah I think that new fans (people that started to listen to Kiss after the reunion) might enjoy this. It has all of the elements of classic Kiss, but it's missing something.Do I think that the prime motivation for this was the money?Yes. Purely for cash. It's nice that the fans had something to go with the tour that was happening at the time, but this album doesn't age very well, mainly because this album wasn't very good in it's conception, and was executed poorly.In retrospect, Kiss has made worse albums. "Unmasked" comes to mind. Peter Criss' solo album was weak, but at least an effort was made. "Animalize" was poor, but Kiss was playing catch-up, and was breaking in a new guitarist too.Some of the tunes are catchy enough, but that wears off quickly. Based on the merit of the somewhat catchy songs, I rated this 2 stars. Other than that, not much here.
0	What a joke!: I was a huge Kiss fan, "was" being the operative word. This album is bad in so many ways. "Within" is the only song worth listening to, and you'll probably enjoy it more if you pretend it's someone other than Kiss. We've heard the truth about Kiss over the last few years. They lie to their fans and take every last cent they can get out of them. The fact that there was no-one else doing what they did in the 70s makes them unique, but not great. After all, every snowflake is unique, but it's still just a snowflake.
1	¡Tengo un alma caribeña!: Even if you've never been to Caribbean, Gloria takes you there with this CD. Perhaps the majority of the songs are on the slower side, but she is "soulful" and it shows. My friend bought this CD, and I borrowed it so much that I got it for myself. The "No me dejes" remix will get you dancing. "Tres Gotas de Agua Bendita" is really fun and lively (with Celia Cruz), while "Por un Beso" is a heartbreaker. Yet even in the slower songs, the background music stays true to the Caribbean, which I appreciated. ¡Dale! You won't regret the purchase.
0	Hummm... Not too much: I found this album a little dissapointing. And the sensation increase in comparation with "mi tierra". The main thing on this is the track selection, wich makes the whole a very downtempo album. Althought there's a couple of up & high beat pieces, the sensation I percive it's like if there were a down for gloria and she wanted to put it in the album. That's no bad. The bad thing comes up when I heard it and I can't get down, Just a little bored. There's no feeling, no emotion, no heart, no music. If you are planning to buy a gloria's CD, don't get this one. Mi tierra would do it best.
0	Always room for improvement: I bought this album after hearing Where The Party At? I still regret it. The only other song I like is Cut Somethin'. All the other songs sound too much alike and the slow jams are a million miles from being creative. All they sing about is breaks up. Do any of their relationships work??????? Basically, I say this album was a waste of money.
1	this cd is tha best: when i first bought this cd the only song i bought it for was "where the party at?" after listening to tha whole thing every song became my favorite. tha ballads kick and the fast songs are indredible its an awesome cd everyone should get it fa sho
1	John M. Keane - Music!: Yes, John M. Keane -- Of the Keane Brothers!!! He and his wife produced this line of videos -- around the time they had their first child. Definitely a fun video set for babies to watch! This is the earliest series, another one was produced by them later is "Baby it's You!" -- My daughter loved them as a toddler!!!
0	The Number is Zero: What a waste of paper and time! There is much talk of how Eisenberg has hit "the sweet spot" with this book -- bah! Humbug! Sweet nothings is more like it. Entertainingly and personably written, it's as informative as a Jerry Seinfeld tv skit about finances. Eisenberg writes extremely well, but it's all much ado about nothing. Read the last two short chapters at the bookstore and put the money you save into your 401K.
1	Every worker should read this book: This is a great book for anyone 20+, who is working and thinking they have it made. As a recent early retiree baby boomer, everything in this book rang true. It's not about the "number", it's about how you spend it and how you need to be prudent in your working years.In addition, the book reads like a novel. I couldn't put it down. Eisenberg's writing is phenomenal. B. Slomka
1	An important read for anyone concerned about retiring: This book is well worth the time to read, the tone is light but the message is very serious. It is an excellent book but to my tastes it could have been edited into a shorter volume.
0	Pointless and depressing: I thought that I was doing ok financically until I read this book. There is little or no financial insight or direction to this book.I really never got the point. It makes you feel that unless you are worth a minimum of10 million dollars you might as well check into the poorhouse. I kept reading hoping to get the point and it was never there!
0	Killer of SSX!!!!!!! :(: Every other SSX game was amazing. This one was very disappointing. I was at a store and I was thrilled to see it on the shelf. I spent (wasted) 40 dollars on this and started playing the second I got home. The music was horrible. The graphics were good. I hated the gameplay.This is baisically the game. There's "The tour" and your trying to get in1st place. You get a better rank every time you beat a challenge. Another thing I dont like about this game is that you make a guy but you cant be any of the classic characters. Well you can unlock them but thats only for 2 player. And whenn you race against them in1 player they are completely different. Like for example You have to race against Nate ( From SSX 3) And instead of being like a normal guy he is like a hick or something.And the point is that if you like the SSX seiries dont get this game.
1	Jared Taylor Has Exposed Left-Wing Racism: If America is ever going to find the truth behind the failed Liberal race-policies, then every American has a moral obligation to read Jared Taylor's "Paved With Good Intentions." Indeed, Mr. Taylor has shown his courage in writing such a book, and he should be applauded for his nobel work. No doubt, there will be those who will claim that Mr. Taylor is a racist. But, the true racists are those who are attacking Mr. Taylor. Mr. Taylor unflinchingly tells the truth about race and crime and how Black racism is proliferating in America. If we are ever going to heal the already damaged race-relations in America, then it is time for us to speak the unspoken truth. God Bless Jared Taylor.
1	More on Marilyn...: The Song Continues is an updated version of Horne's earlier My Life. Much of the text is the same. Even so, we needed an update, didn't we? For having a kind of "take no prisoners" style, Horne is pretty generous with foes as well as friends. (She doesn't re-tell the Sills/Scala incident here.) There are some new pictures, which is wonderful. Even more wonderful, and almost worth the purchase price all on its own, is the bonus CD. There are18 songs on the CD. While they don't come up in chronological order, they are generally arranged earlier to later; you can still get the feeling for how that miraculous instrument evolved. I'm glad I have both books.
0	Love his other books, but...: It pains me to write anything negative about David Mead's work as I highly value and wholeheartedly recommend his other books, in particular "The Ten Minute Guitar Workout", "Basic Guitar Workout", and "Rhythm - A Step by Step Guide to Understanding Rhythm for Guitar". These are all great learning tools that would serve guitarists of almost any level well.But then there's this book. It's not bad, but it's not nearly as concise as his other works. In fact, I read it three times and still felt rather confused. Maybe I'm an idiot, but when it comes to explaining the CAGED system of organizing the fretboard, which is ultimately what this book is about, I learned more in14 pages of Bill Edward's excellent Fretboard Logic series than in reading this book from cover to cover.Buy Mead's other books, especially if you're an intermediate or beginner. But if you want to master the fretboard, get Fretboard Logic. There is no other.
1	April Morning is a MUST READ for all Americans: It may start out boring but inside is the intense in-battle story against the British. This Revolutionary War story is about a young boy named Adam who sees his father and friends murdered on the battle line at Lexington. Together Adam, a crazy old X-British officer and some friends drive the British out (not alone, there was all of the other farmers too, they just stayed in a group). Un-like other revolutionary war storys this one takes place in a two day period with gruesome detials of war. Once you've read the book the movie is a cheap immation but fun none the less.<BR
0	Hieroglyphic maps: The Joy of OrigamiThis book is colorful and seemed promising for a beginner to self teach. The diagrams maybe okay if you already know what they are suppose to look like at each step, but as a teaching aid they compare to teaching American children from a hieroglyphic test. I bought another book on the same subject to help get through the simplest basics, but it was only marginally better. Van Sicklen is not a beginner's writer. This book could easily drive people away from the art through frustration.
1	part1: I believe that this book is preety cheap.When I bought it I was so enthusiastic to learn math, exept for the procrastinations intervening with the main plot, which I consider a very constant, consistent, and reliable flow of information; explaining very deltailed, which formula you need to apply in which situation. Despite the statements which I have claimed about the quality of the book "Cheap", I still believe it passes my test by a mile, and it's explanations are extraordinary, namely for beginners. You can't even start to anticipate how this book altered my math grade. Instead of arbitrarily electing some sequence for the formulae, he invents his own effective process. I recommend this book to all the folks, who have a B,A. So that they can progress and have an A+ :)For the jungens, with C's they would presumably not understand the context.
0	Joe - Oh No!: As a Joe Jackson fan, this comes off as a major dissapointment. Joe pulls off a fairly uninspired striped down live album recorded at NYC's Joes Pub. While it's nice to hear some of the old standards again like "One More Time" and "Hometown", he also does Duke Ellington's "Mood Indigo", which sounds out of place and sung painfully. His version of Steely Dan's "King Of The World" sounds strained. He should have put in "Any Major Dude" which he did so much better at The Bottom Line a few months before this gig. His musicianship is still very good, but you're left asking what's the point of this record? We can only hope that we get more of his quality stuff in "Night & Day II" due this fall.
1	Good: It was a bit more pinkish-red than I had thought (the lava and the liquid) but it's still pretty and enjoyable.
0	Unreliable Quality: I've got one of those and it was so cloudy that I was hardly able to see the lava. Plus the lava didn't move at all after several tries. I was very dissatisfied and returned the item, and got the same thing from directly Target's website. This time it's clear and works fine (though it takes about 2 hours to warm up, but I think it's normal for new lava lamps). So, I'm very happy with my new lava lamp. I don't know the reason, but I guess somehow Lava Lite doesn't have a good quality control on its products. If you're lucky you get a good one but chances are also high that you might get a dysfunctional one. So order it at your own risk.
0	elizabeth and alexandra: This is not the book for people interested in the Romanovs.Its a silly,misleadingbizzare, historical novel.So much misinformation is given,that it shouldnt even be called historical. Dont waste your money,like I did.
1	Read the Fineprint: Overall, this is a good collection of gospel and spiritual music... I would not, however, have called it a soundtrack when , aside from the classic theme song, is music that helped inspire the creation of the show.The standout track, to me, was Amy Grant's contribution.
0	Simplistic: I teach strategic management in the MBA program and do not recommend that this book be used. The cases are very dated and industry restructuring, as well as poor coverage of new technologies (such as the Internet), make this book tedious reading. Miller also fails to include several theories and frameworks (such as Porter's industry analysis) which gives spotty coverage to some areas. The international dimension is also very poor -- the assumption is that international environments are similar to domestic environments and a pursuit of profits (Miller's definition of success) is all that is needed in both for companies. Simplistic!
1	Superb version of a fine Heinlein story: Have Spacesuit, Will Travel is one of the best of Heinlein's so-called juveniles (which I've always believed were some of his best writing) and now it is available is a really excellent audio recording. The Full Cast Audio treatment takes a great story and makes it come alive. Highly recommended!
1	Replacement of a lost book: Having moved twice in eighteen months, it was inevitable that a few things went missing. This book was a replacement and is the same edition I had for years. The condition was as advertised. Delivery was prompt. I am happy to have it on the Heinlein shelf in my library -- I just wish I could get my grandchildren to read Heinlein instead of playing video games!
1	Brilliant..: I recommend this CD to anyone, the Diva's did a brilliant job, Carole King was a welcome guest. Buy it, it is worth it. Buy the video too!
0	Good movie, poor dvd: The movie "The Junky's Christmas" is great clocking in at only 20 mins. It is a must have for any Burroughs fan. Anyone considering purchasing this should be fairly warned that you only get 20 minutes or Burroughsy goodness for your $17.99 (amazon price at time of writing). The other two shorts are not Burroughs related and are horrid. To sum it all up, if you are like me and like filling your entire house with dvds you'll only watch once then by all means buy this. Otherwise don't.
1	This movie was so funny!: I think that anybody that has a sense of humor would really like this movie. My brother rented it and i fell off the couch like 3 times because I was laughing so hard.
1	A TRULY UNDERATED COMEDY!!!!!!!!!!!!!: I have no idea why this movie did as bad as it did. In my opinion it was a truly fun film. It had a great mix of sports gags and situational comedy. Matt Stone And Trey Parker had so much fun doing this. I could not stop laughing at Dian Bachar. He was incredibly funny as Squeak. Don't miss out on this film. Funniest movie of1998.
0	Movie history in the making!: Move over Star Wars and make room for this fabulous and wicked movie, the two outragouse creaters of South Park have done it again and pulled out another comedy great. Only that one was actually funny and successful, and the other is a guarenteed qualifier for the WORST movie ever made in the history and the face of this rock we live on. Watch this movie and you're automatically part of somthing special, the other end of the spectrum of what the movie industry has to offer.
1	hilarious: This movie is hilarious!!!!!!!! I saw it with my friend and we laughed throughout the entire thing.
1	best movie ever: Let me tell you this movie was the funniest thing i havve ever seen buy it, hey it's not like its a great deal of money you'll enjoy everything about it from the cheerleaders to the funky psche outs. get it quick!!
1	leonides: it's not the kind of music u can listen to every day , but his playing is awesome , something to marvel !!
0	A Mess: If you're in the mood for a film arranged around the relentless, overenunciated narration of a surpassingly bland main character, "Watch Out" is the film for you. I beg everyone else looking for the kind of shocks and outrageousness behind this film's advertising campaign not to make the mistake I did -- put on a blindfold and pick out anything by Russ Meyer, Herschell Gordon Lewis or Guy Maddin and count your blessings.
1	good movie: I have tried to watch this movie several times on TV, but always either miss the beginning or have to stop watching it before it's over. I was so glad to find this available in DVD. I was able to watch it in its entirety, without commercials. It's a very good movie. I highly recommend it.
1	catherine bell: i really enjoyed this dvd ,love every thing that catherine bell is in she is such a good actressthis dvd cane very quickly,thankyou so much.norma east.
1	A really good book!: I remember reading this when I was a kid. I always thought it was a pretty neat book. Time travel is always a cool thing to read about, and this one is pretty good too. One of the best things I remember is writing a letter to the author. She wrote me a full-length letter back! For an11-year-old kid, that's quite a thrill. I recommend this book for any children's book library.
0	ok, but not the best.....or newhere near it: i understand where she was coming from and each of the characters problems. i'm only in eighth grade, but i know that this is real life and how people react to different things. however, the characters didn't do anything about their problems. Carson McCullers must have been dumped or something when she wrote this book because it's very depressing. the thing i don't understand is why people would want to read about real life when we already live it. we all know what life is like so what is the point of this book? it took me so long just to read a chapter. i didn't get into it at all. the book just makes you want to commit suicide or something. the only reason i read it was to get a good grade . well, at least i get $10 for getting an A in my stupid english class. u know how they say, "never judge a book by it's cover," well this book is a way more boring than the cover, take my word for it.
1	Best American Literature: The Heart is a Lonely Hunter began as a short under a different title and eventually was completed as this masterpiece of a novel that has earned it's place in the best of American Literature.McCuller's story takes you into the south in another time but what she wrote about then still rings true in the heart of the human soul. Her's is a story of human wants, desires, needs, loss and the true human condition. There are single sentences alone in this book that will take your breath away as McCullers simply puts into words what we can never seem to find the words to express what we feel, what we want. I loved this book and seriously believe everyone should consider reading The Heart is a Lonely Hunter. After discovering McCuller's work through this book I have continued to read other books such as Clock Without Hands and others. She has become among my favorite authors of all time.
1	Loved it.: This book, which reminded me of To Kill a Mockingbird even though the two are completely unrelated, was very good. It's about confused and lonely teenagers, a crazy deaf Greek, and lonely man, and how they meet and react with each other. Tres interessant!
0	Did it really take all these pages to detail......nothing?!?!?!?: Oprah's book club has lost a lot of its credibility with this book.This book just seemed to go on and on and on without anything really happening.It babbled on for something like 360 pages to document the following things: A quasi-homosexual relationship between two mutes; A revolutionary drunk; A snotty, pretentious doctor who babbled on about Karl Marx (*yawn*-- how long is it going to be before people let him go?); A white trash girl who loved music.Save your money (and your time).
1	For those who love to read, the "Lonely Hunters": I always love delving into a well-written, even complex book and getting into the minds of the characters. I was not bored or disappointed at all by this book. It is a book that will appeal to those who feel caught between "irony and faith," or for people who are searching for truth and something to give a lonely life fulfillment.
0	I Tried: I've read so many of Oprah's book selections and for the first time - I am truly disappointed.I am unable to finish the novel. It moves slowly, and I catch myself losing focus while reading. Sure, I get the connection with the characters and the writing is pretty good but it is extremely dull and tedious to read. I feel like I'm back in HS torturing myself to read a book. This is not what reading is supposed to be.After reading these reviews I guess I'll just read the last page to see what happens.Sorry Oprah!
0	Disappointed: I was also disappointed with this book. I heard Oprah talking about how great it was, and I found it a struggle to read. I was easily distracted when reading this book. Overall, a big disappointment
0	I agree - its BORING: I wish I would have read these reviews before I picked up the book at the local booksellers. I kept waiting for something good to happen, but alas... it never got to the level I expected. :(
0	Unremitting Bleakness of Life: I coudn't stop thinking while I was reading this, I couldn't stand more than a hundred pages, that it was a brilliant work for a very sensitive,depressed, lonely, highly intelligenttwenty something writer. Who wasn't made like other folks, and for many artists that's a necessary evil. I havent' read anything else by her, and I don't think I will, I have a feeling life doesn't get better in the works of Carson McCuller and that's too bad.The writing is much better than OK, but,this work is amateurish in structure. There is no impelling story of any kind, just a wearing down, gets to be boring, pastiche of miserable and semi-miserable characters going nowhere except into a future of deepening misery and despair.Yes there are pleanty of folks like that but nothing redeems them here.McCullers is a southern grotesque who lacks the vitality of Flannery O'Connor and the enduring humanity and brilliance of William Faulkner.
1	How to Study Your Bible: This is an excellent book. Very helpful if you are unsure how to study a your Bible or if you have been haphazard in doing so. It has made and will continue to make my time alone with God more inclusive, unforgettable, and even more precious to me. Thank you, Kay Arthur for making this available to us.Nada Davis
1	Maceo is king as the funkdafied jazzman: Live On Planet Groove posesses jazz reminiscent of Maceo's earlier work, yet with a newfound funk element... It's truly dope.
1	famous arias: I purchased this a few years ago and found it extremely useful. Now I cannot find the original and am ordering another copy. I found it practical, useful, correct, the right size, etc. and would recommend it to anyone who is serious about opera.
0	Good concept - Bad Execution: This kid acoustic guitar looks really nice, but when it comes to using it, we had to DUCT TAPE the tuner knobs in order to keep the strings in place. And we had to use A LOT OF DUCT TAPE. The guitar is of no use if the strings won't stay in place and without duct tape, we couldn't get one string to play.Now that it is all duct taped, my 3 year old does enjoy it, but the toy shouldn't have to be duct taped in order to work properly.
0	Product is misrepresented: This item is misrepresented in the description. It comes with a strap that cannot be attached without buying and installing an end pin and it says it comes with a pitch pipe which was not included. The product details are misleading and although the price is good you do not get what you think you are paying for.
1	Strong Material: This is a very strong effort that deserves to be rewarded with higher sales than it has logged so far. Breach is at its best when it is focused on the relationship between people, and fortunately, that's where most of the focus lies. The people on this album seem to occupy the same mythic landscape as those on the early Springsteen albums, where life and death intermingle and all battles are epic. The only real weak spot for me is Murder101, which sounds kind of like an afterthought compared to the fully wrought songs elsewhere. Sleepwalker is, of course, one of the strongest rock singles in some time, but what surprises me is that the sparkling I've Been Delivered has not broken through on radio yet. Witness is another high point. Highly recommended.
1	The opposite of "Ten": Pearl Jam have changed considerably since1991's debut "Ten", and this excellent collection of songs mirror a band clearly more at ease with life than they were in the early 90s. Lead single "Nothing as it Seems" makes up for it's lack of bite with the exploration of soundscapes born in the Mid West, while "Light Years" and "Thin Air" show a subtlety in the band's personality that went previously unexplored. My only gripes are with the absence of a real grabber like "Jeremy" or "Rearviewmirror", and the trowaway nature of "Grievance", but, hell, I'm only nitpicking. Lovely.
0	They've lost it: Pearl Jam died, and this was the nail in the coffin. Gone are the furious beats of Vs, the melodic enchant of Ten, and the pure grunge soul of Vitalogy. All I hear is a weak, tired band that has run out of fuel.
0	a poor job by a great band: i bought this album because i am a big pearl jam fan. when i first listened to it i was suprised how boring it was. i figured i just needed to let it grow on me so i listened to it again a couple of days later. unfortunatley i found that it was still monotonous and the songs tend to run together because they sound so similar. i still think pearl jam is a great band with a lot of talent, but this album doesn't have the energy or creativeness that makes them that way. if you have every other pearl jam album, buy this one to complete your set. if you don't, pick one ot the others.
1	Doing the Evolution: In some respects, I think Yield is a better album, but Binaural still suffices for greatness. Binuaral contains three songs that are not Pearl Jam caliber, though they sound to be at first--God's Dice, Sleight of Hand, and Long Road 2, Parting Ways. Thriteen songs in the album, minus 3, equal10, all of which are songs that could be played over and over again--some may argue for God's Dice--and I'm not say that it is bad either. The strength of the album is its quirkiness, and the band being able to compose songs that have natural sound to them. I think that's been key to their success. Key words that loom in Binaural are quirkiness,as in Rival and Soon Forget, supressed rage, as heard in Greivance, and mind-playing guitars that seem to want to spin into something off of Vs. but instead retain driving composure as in Of the Girl, Insignificance. What can you say? Vedder and the boys just keeping doing it . . .
1	Binaural My view: Binaural is a mix of the new sound of Pearl Jam with the drummer Matt Cameron. It's great to hear Eddie playing different instruments like the ukele. Somehow pj sounds traditional in this age of boy groups and pop music. In1998 they released the album Yield. Songs like In Hiding, and Given To Fly were ballads that showed off the mild rocking side of pj. Now on Binaural, you have songs like Breakerfall and Light Years that have simmilar rocking styles. Nothing as it seems, gives off the a Pink Floyd sounding background guitar by Mcready. Overall after listening to the new album twice it has grown on me!
0	The band that just won't go away: This has to be the most boring album of all time. Right up there with Yield, Riot Act and No Code. I don't know what it's going to take for this band to finally call it quits. They have no talent and their lead singer just mumbles into the microphone -- you can't understand a word he's saying.If you're looking for a fresh sound, you can't go wrong with a band like Creed. They're talented and they have passion for their work -- not like these washed up has-beens. Pearl Jam has no real talent. Warning: this album is horrible. Listen to the song previews and you'll agree with me.
0	A valient effort: Remember the days when Pearl Jam was good? back in good-ol-days with nirvana and other grunge bands.This was a valient effort from a once good band but thats all it was an effort. I hate to break the news to everyone but Pearl Jam is dead, and this cd ceartainly isn't helping bring them back from the dead.Save your memories of pearl jam, when they were good, and save your Money.
0	Santana has done it again... eh... literally!: Yep! Santana comes back yet once more with the SAME formula: lots of big names in the music biz packed in a nice album, with him and his band playing to them. End of formula. Is the album bad? Not by any means, if you isolate it from the rest of his musical production. But if you consider this guy has been putting out significantly more original material in years past, listening to more of this Santana-guitar-sound-accompanying-some-big-name-in-the-music-business is quite dissapointing. Once more, I feel fortunate for having Napster. I wouldn't buy this album, not even for its contagious opening "Hermes". My advice is simple: skip it. I give it two stars for what it's worth production-wise, but nothing else.
0	Don't Treat Your Fans Like Criminals with Copy "Protection" Rootkits/Software: This Santana album has MediaMax copy protection software embedded in the CD. The problem with this CD is that the MediaMax program installs undisclosed--and in some cases, hidden--files on users' Windows computers, potentially exposing music fans to malicious attacks by third parties. The infected CDs also communicated back to the record company about customers' computer use without proper notification.This is unacceptable and it will make me think twice before buying another Santana album. Also, if the record company wishes to treat me like a criminal and take away the right to make a personal copy of music I purchase because of a few bad apples, then it should realize that it will lose its few remaining customers.Santana, please release this CD without these copy protection schemes and I will buy it. Thank you.
0	another sellout: Sorry diehards but Carlos is selling out to the mainstream, what was once beautiful music from this man has turned into the same crap we hear from every other mainstream artist you see on mtv day in and day out....I bought this at a local store cause it was cheap... 9.95... gonna take it out and play frisbee with it tomorrow or give it to the first hip hopper that comes along....Carlos is no longer a Shaman.. just a Shame....
0	Sony Root Kiet: I was going to get this for my dad for X-mass, but sorry Sony not going to get. You lost out on my money because I am not going to give my father a virus. Guess I will get the next CD on his list.
0	I wish I could hear it!: I CAN'T BEIEVE IT - SAME CRAP I FOUND MY "LAST" CHRIS BOTTI - IT DOES NOT PLAY. IT MAY BE OK IN MY CD PLAYER IN MY TRUCKNO RESPONSE FROM WEB HELP; I HAVE THE LATEST VERSION OF WINDOWS MEDIA PLAYER AND DIRECTX SINCE I ONLY HAVE WINDOWS 2000 - MY WORK COMPUTER WHICH I CANNOT UPGRADE, NOT MY PERSONAL COMPUTERLAST DISC I BUY FROM SONY - END OF SUBJECTMAD AS HELLarista is part of sony
0	If you use an iPod and a PC forget this CD!: You cannot transfer music from this CD to iPod if you are using a PC.That alone is enough to turn me off, since that is the only way I listen to music these days. Sorry Santana, I'm not interested enough to even bother although I've been a fan for MANY years. And Sony, well, you confirmed that for this consumer, you just ceased to exist. You installed software on my PC without telling me what it would do, and without informed consent. Your rootkit technology has proven to be very dangerous for consumers, seriously compromising PC security. I currently don't own anything made by Sony, and that is the way it will stay.
0	Rootkit: Because this disc installs a rootkit that slows down your PC and makes your PC easy to hijack by hackers I am not going to order it. Sony and Santana can keep their Copy protected CD!
0	Stuff Rootkill: I broke this piece of junk in half, it did damage to my PC. I dont care about losing the CD. It's the principle!! Release this like a normal CD and I will buy it or I will go to ITunes and download and have freedom with the music. That's after I find a way to get rid of the virus this thing infected my PC with. My computer has since been hacked. Sell me a virus and you can keep it, I will never buy garbage with this kind of software attached again (no matter who the artist)!!
0	All Than He Isn't - Santana Sells Out: I rated this one quite generously. That one star was awarded just to Santana's name because this music almost makes me feel cheated.Santana, in my opinion, is one of the greatest gutarists of all time. Sure, there are the technical masters such as Malmsteen and Vai, but no one has the same feel as Carlos Santana. It's just a shame that he would take all of his talent and throw it away on garbage like this.If you actually like this music, then have fun, jump off a bridge. But if you agree that Santana is better than this, than check out anything else, the earlier the better, and definately go live.Overall, this album makes me wannt to throw up. Santana replaces all the beautiful spanish sound and soulfull chord progressions with pop garbage. Don't buy it.
0	what is this carlos?: What can I say about this album of the great Carlos Santana? Sorry Carlos, but....I will say....ugh!!!!!!!! please.....Come back to play with his band!!
1	Required reading for anyone working with clients!: This is a great book for ALL levels of experience.If you're just starting your career as an account executive this wonderfully outlines many things you can do to instantly improve your client relations. And if you've been working with clients for a long time this will serve as an invaluable reference. You shouldn't just read it once, but over and over again!It's a quick read that can make a huge impact on your career and clients.
1	A Chemical Dependency Must Own: This small under-rated book is THE definitive book on virtually all drugs of abuse. It breaks down each of the drugs by category and by use, giving the properties of each and their derivation, and side effects including potential for addiction. Anyone interested in the chemical abuse field, or merely curious about some of the drugs they may be prescribed, will find this an exceptional buy.
0	THIS IS A TERRIBLE ALBUM: if you're considering buying this album i'd say you'd probably enjoy it, but if you have any respect for yourself and the people around you please forget it and buy something less terrible.
1	The Best Debut CD EVER!: This band is amazing. Like everybody else, the first song I ever heard was Absolutely (story of a girl), and I bought the CD because that song was great. But the rest of the CD is even better. "If I Am," "Sometimes," "Crazy," and all the other songs on the CD are gorgeous. They shouldn't be compared to other five person bands like Matchbox 20 or Vertical Horizon because they blow the hell out of those bands. Nine Days are five truly gifted musicians who deserve to go platinum one million times over. Everyone should by this CD because I guarantee there is not one track on it that will disappoint you. Nine Days is a breath of fresh air in the music world and should not be missed. Buy this CD!
1	Great Debut Album-- Keep 'em coming: I first heard "Story of a Girl" on VH1 and loved it. I bought the CD and was very pleased with the rest also. The whole CD is really well done and well put together. Buy it now.
1	Great C.D.: I love this c.d. Nine Days are absolutely great. They have depth and meaning to all their songs and though some people have said that all the songs sound alike, I disagree. So anway, basically like my title says, it's a great c.d.
0	Biased, but Mirrors U.S. Version: Purchased Book thinking it was the U.S. version of the book, but received the International version ("NOT to be used in the U.S." according to the cover of the book). To date, the book mirrors the U.S. version exactly page for page, question for question. My only comment would be that the book is biased towards a U.S. view. I thought this was quite strange for an "International" management book and the "International" version no less. Some sections and stories appear to speak more negatively about other counties and paints the United States in a more positive light. It was my assumption that a book dealing with International subjects would be more objective and state the factual differences and similarities to managing in other countries and cultural differences.
0	Where is Rod?: Where has Rod Stewart gone? This is so bad that I couldn't even finish listening to the CD. I am such a big Rod Stewart fan, but I think his glory days are over. I have had my fill of his remakes at this point. Don't waste your money on this one.
1	Loved this album: We love this album. SO glad we did not read the negative reviews or we probably would not have bought it. We heard the television promo with some of the song highlights and immediately went to Amazon and pre-ordered it. We take it with us on car trips and love to sing along. It is a peppy and a fun companion for the car. We would have given it 5 stars if it had "Leave Virginia Alone" on it. That was one of his biggest hits and one we also enjoy. If you like the songs on the album, by all means by it and forget about what the negative reviews say about Rod. It is a good album and he doesn't deserve the criticism.
1	Still the Same...Great Rock Classics Of Our Time- Rod Stewart: Rod is always good. I liked this because of the songs. Not a bad one on it. He did good. Good driving music.
0	Rod adds nothing to these classic tunes: As someone else wrote in review, Rod sounds like he's singing to a karaoke track. The backing instrumental tracks in most cases, especially Have You Ever Seen The Rain sound like they were created by turning a tape recorder on and copying directly from the original song. Boring. Also on Day After Day, Rod's drummer uses identical fills at the identical spots Badfinger's drummer's played his. The album is very uninspired. However,it was clever of him to record It's A Heartache because most people compared Bonnie Tyler to Stewart when she released that tune yrs ago. This is the1st Rod album I've bought since Sing It Again Rod and this is not even close to the quality of that release. As most people said, Rod has enough money. If he won't write or perform any new original material anymore, he should think about packing it in. He's had a nice run.
0	Cool Breeze: This Honeywell product is excellent. It works quietly and easily circulates air while providing the desired breeze.I believe the unit will outlive its generous warranty, and would not hesitate to purchase another one if and when it should wear out.
0	Warn the neighbors and stick cotton in your ears: My15 year old 4 speed oscillating fan stopped oscillating, so I decided to get a replacement. Wonder why they call it a "Turbo High Performance Fan"? Ever stood next to a turbo jet on take-off? Well, you get the idea. Even on its lowest setting it is louder than my old fan on its highest setting. On low, I had to blast up the TV volume. I am not returning this item only because it is throwing good money after bad--the cost of returning it. I will use it as a spare, load the old12 gauge and wait for the neighbors to come breaking down the door.
1	Superb Story: I enjoyed this book. There were mysteries inside of mysteries and it was fun to read, all the time, I speculated as to possible outcomes.
1	A book to live by!: In my yoga classes, the instructor would read a passage before we began each practice - something to meditate on. But I only have class 2-3 times a week, so I found the book very easily on Amazon. It was way more inexpensive that I had imagined, so I ordered a 2nd one for a friend. I have only ready through day13 on my new book, but I absolutley LOVE it! I really appreciate how it is broken down into short, but insightful, daily readings. I read a passage in the morning before I am even out of bed now, and have the day to soak it in, then read the same passage again before I go to sleep with a new perspective. I see myself reading this book over & over again for many years - a great book to really live the yoga lifestyle by.
1	Yoga for thinkers: As one who has never attended a Yoga class, I am fascinated by this book because I feel as though I am doing Yoga as I sit and read and think, read and think. Yoga is so much more than being on a mat, although that experience is certainly most central to the discipline. What I am discovering is the meaning of the discipline. I am able to envision the physical movements as I sort out, mentally, the meaning of my imagined activity. Because Gates puts his readers through stages of using their minds, he also expects those readers to repeat those stages over and over. In repeating the exercises, readers bring new thoughts and experiences to the reading activity and each exposure is different from the last one. As such, the book is always new, exciting, provocative, mysterious, riveting.
1	ONE IN A MILLION: Rolf Gates' book is the kind of blessing that only comes around with the regularity of Haley's Comet. By his blending of quotes, personal experience, and yoga instruction, he accomplishes something of serene wonder. His book conveys the very heart of yoga, for it reaches the reader on a level beyond words, phrases, or didactics. Using the book as a daily inspirational guide, the seeker can find and find abundantly.
1	Great Story, but watch the language: Got this book because it was on the Sunshine State Readers list for 3-5 grade. Problem: author uses language that is inappropriate for this age group. Several uses of the word "bu**" another "fa**" and several "b**b", which I find inappropriate for 8 -10 year old kids. My local public elementary school won't even stock the book. Why would Mr. Fogelin do this to an otherwise great kids book?
1	Just like Nancy Drew: Great story for a quick read by the same author who wrote many of the Nancy Drew books.The entire Penny Parker series is dated in the1940's, but cutesy and interesting.
0	No Rubber Seal: I figured that a gas cap like this would ship with a rubber seal on the inside. It does not. Had to makeshift a rubber seal. Really a big bummer.
1	dry floors: We love the Water Boy water dish.No longer constantly mopping up after our dog drinks. We have given one to our daughter for her dog and she loves it.We are buying more for other family dogs and want a spare for us when the summer comes,heard you can fill half way and freeze so it's ready for a hot day or just a hike through the park.
0	Travel water bowl best suited to smaller breeds: I gave this a two star rating based on the fact that mine was to be used for a larger dog. This product would be adequate for a small dog. But the opening for a dog with a larger muzzle is not large enough. The claims for not spilling water seem to be true. However, since only about an inch of water is in the bottom of the opening at any time, it's more difficult for a larger dog to get his nose in and get a good drink. I guess if the dog were extremely thirsty and had no other water supply, this could do in a pinch.
1	Nice.: Great to have a large capacity water container that is made to minimize spills. Good for travel and kennel recommend to all who travel.
1	Great travel water bowl: I am happy with this product and they are spill proof as stated. I would love to see a cover to make this product leak proof too! If you lay the travel water bowl flat they do not spill, however they do spill if you place them in an upright position. I place these in the freezer and then take these to the fields to water the dogs while we are planting.My chocolate lab has no problem drinking from this product.
1	Incredible!: The name of this book is what caught my eye, but, as soon as I opened it, I realized how great it is. I learned of quite a few mistakes I make, and often WHY. The author's somewhat ranting tone makes an otherwise dense and boring subject a bit more approachable. I highly recommend this book.
1	Novice user, but good enough to see a good stick.: I just received this stick today. I'm anxious to take it home and try it out. I can say it is smooth, straight, and glides through my fingers with ease. The weight is perfect for what I am looking for, and it feels like a perfect fit. If this stick performs as well as it looks and feels, I may have just found the sticks to fill my rack.As far as the shipping goes, it was delayed at first, but when they did ship it, it literally got here the next day. I have absolutely no complaints about the shipper. If it fails to meet my expectations, I will update this on an "As Needed Basis".
1	Great book to learn banjo!!: I bought it as an extra book and have used the same book for years (mine was deteriorating) and have shown it to many friends to use when they express an interest in learning to play the banjo. It is a great book. I love it.
0	Retraction! Company fixed CD Works Great now!: The company fixed the CD and sounds great now! Great company to work with. Very responsive. Would definitely buy from them again!Would definitely give them 5 stars but Amazons review editing system won't let me change my rating!
1	Worked like a charm!: Wasn't sure what was wrong with my ice maker, so I bought this kit. Replaced just the main ice maker component (took less than10 minutes), and the unit started right up. It has been making ice reliably. Great deal.
0	GE=No Good: GE neglects to inform you that you need a special1/4 inch saddle valve! It cost me150.00 for a diagnosis with out putting it on. If your cubes are hollow or slushie this is the problem. I contacted GE with 502-452-4205 they dismiss the problem and cost. I will never buy GE again!
0	A HUGE Disappointment: I have to admit this CD is my most major disappoint so far this year. There just doesn't seem to be much energy left in GVSB. I've always suspected that Scott McCloud was the real talent behind this group, and he's the only one who still sounds like he's holding up, the rest of them just fizzle. This impression was reinforced when I saw them peform at the Mercury Lounge on a trip to New York a few weeks ago. McCloud came through (barely), but the others acted half dead. Johnny Temple in particular seemed out of it. I was pretty close to the stage and he looked sort of tired and stressed, so maybe he was having an off night. I hope so. Otherwise it looks like this is going to be GVSB's last hurrah.
1	Guitar: Great guitar to buy if you want to save some money on a beginner guitar. Acoustics are always a good first guitar it helps you develop fundamentals. And it sounds great for the price.
1	Penguin: The real pictures in this book are great! It describes the life cycle of a penguin in easy-to-understand words.
1	Los Mocosos does it again!!!!!!!!!!!: Los Mocosos is a very unique band with strong latin roots from the Mission Dist. If you are a fan of Santana, Malo, War, Tower of Power this is a must CD for you to have in your collection. I have all Los Mocosos cd's and they are all great. This one includes an eclectic mix and a beautiful remake of "I'm your puppet". It is better than the original. These guys will go far and I hope they stay together for a long time to come. It is not very often that I like a whole CD but I like every song on this Cd. This is a cd that you must get. Check out their other cd Shades of Brown also a great cd. Peace Light Love Joy and enjoy this Los Mocosos cd. Ike
0	Waste of money and dangerous Steroids too: This stuff was a waste of money. It contains Androst chemicals which are steroids. There are safer products on the market too. I tried Instinto Sensual. It is safe and works great too.
1	hooks the brillant: this is a throuogh explanation on the state of the African American. it is a worthwhile book for anyone intersted in African Amrican people. it is a brillant book writtn by a brillant writer. it worth buying and reading it.
0	Poor Sound Quality for the price: Compared to Shure's E2cs, the rival they're going for, it just doesn't match up. For almost the same price, they offer a higher noise isolation, i've compared them in outdoor environments.
0	Creative Zen Aurvana In-Ear Headphones: They make it sould like these are active noise canceling headphones. They are also priced like they are. However, they are just over-prices bud headphones.
0	Comfortable but ...: These are very comfortable, small and light, and they block the ambient noise very well. There are a couple of major problems however. One is that the chord is microphonic. It transmits a loud scraping sound to the earpieces when it rubs on your face or clothing. The other is the response. The only other earphones I have to compare it against are the Ultimate Ears Super.fi 3, (a.k.a. Altec Lansing UHP336). The Zen suffers very badly by comparison. It has an uneven frequency response with a bump in the mid treble range around 3kHz to 5kHz that makes it sound shouty. Another nit is that there is no room in the supplied carrying case for the airplane connection adapter.
0	Wrong item received: I ordered the hardcover book pictured at a price of $66. I received a paperback with a cover price of 95 cents! Waiting to hear from the seller.
1	ceramabryte scraper: This tool is small for nice storage and use. The razor or sharp edge works perfect on my flat top stove for scraping off burnt on stuff before I use the rest of ceramabryte prodects to clean it. The razor appears to be replaceable.
0	Not Worth the Money - Skip It!: This book is a waste of money. It contains dated information and it is not well organized. You could find better data on Google.I was looking for a list of addresses for softball and volleyball players and there is no place in the book to find names that are grouped by sport.Save your money - take a few minutes and look up the information yourself. A real mess!
0	The book was mostly just boring.: A few of the chapters were interesting. I liked the ones about slave revolts, but the rest were about people talking about war, the sugar interest, or other VERY boring things. I had to read this book for school and was supposed to take notes, but the book was so boring that I couldn't find the main idea of many chapters. The most interesting characters in the book didn't even exist and the historical ones were hardly even mentioned. For a historically acurate book, Caribbean is hardly acurate and I would not read this one just for fun.
0	Hypocrite Lecteur!: Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, submitted for your consideration: "The Predators," by Mark Washburn and Robert Webb (Stein and Day,1984). From the jacket blurb:"The fiercest creature in the sea is the Great White Shark. The fiercest creature on land is the Kodiak Brown Bear. What happens when they are doomed by human predators to fight each other in the fiercest specatator sport ever imagined?Can human perversity encompass a combat between a twenty-foot Great White and a two-thousand-pound Kodiak for the sake of entertainment? Big-time promoter Augie Zisk is certain it can, and when the scheme is first brought to him he says only one word: cable. Ten million people will pay to watch an exhibition on television, and General Hidalgo de Carazonzo will be happy to host the show in his banana republic."A neglected, and now hideously cannibalized, masterpiece.For shame, Mr. Bachelder. J'accuse!
0	Not funny. No real plot. Poor satire. Not well written: I was greatly disappointed with Bear V. Shark. I expected something funny. It is not. I expected satire and political humor, it has none. If the author was trying for a book like, "1984" or "Brave New World" or "Fahrenheit 451" or "Animal Farm" or "The Jungle" he missed by a huge margin. Truly good satire tells a story, and makes a message. BearV. Shark does neither.The book is so inconsistent and difficult to follow that it becomes almost unreadable. It reminded me of the ramblings of a psychiatric patient (was that the author's intent?) I did finish the book hoping it would wind up in a glorious manner, but it just plods along and ends.None of the characters are in any way believable. None of the situations are engaging. None of the attempts at humor are funny. I was really, really disappointed. Did the other reviewers actually read this book?
0	A lot of syrup: This DVD has a few really enjoyeable songs. It is one of those videos that seeing it one time is enough. There are some good history points and traveling interest Daniel explains and good scenery of Ireland which make the video palatable. Too much video footage is of Daniel himself. I would recommed buying this DVD if you can get it for a low price.
0	Works for 6 weeks: This unit broke, simply stopped working after six weeks since opening the box. The unit was used nearly every day 5 days a week in an industrial, workbench environment. I believe the units works well when functional. Perhaps it is most suited for hobbyists.Edit: Amazon replaced our unit with a duplicate model without labels or brand stickers. It still works today.
0	Do not buy: I had this gun about 6 months before it just quit working. Save your money and buy something else.
0	Not worth it.: I purchased this in February 2012. It died in late July 2012. In that span of time I had used the gun perhaps 7-8 times for a total of no more than 2-3 hours of cumulative use. Then last Saturday the gun just died. I happened to notice a bit of sparking though the vents in the lower housing and then that was all they wrote for the heat gun.It does have a 2 year warranty, but for what it would cost me in shipping I would rather put that money towards another to replace it. Which is what I plan to do.Judging from other reviews on this heat gun it's pretty much hit and miss. You might get a good one or like a bad one. My suggestion? Look for a product that has far more hits than misses.
0	Nice toy, poor training device: The hardware itself is well-built. The display is high-contrast and easy to read, and the buttons have a good feel and are laid out rationally. The problem is with the software.The biggest problem is the fact that this device has the dealer stand on16 (hard or soft), not17, making the device useless for practicing Basic Strategy. There are a few other quirks with the software. A player's three or more card 21 wins instantly--no push against a dealer's 21. Also, the dealer doesn't expose his natural, allowing you to double-down or split against it and lose twice (but also allows you to surrender against it). You are only allowed to double-down on a10 or ace, a rule seldom found in shoe games. An ace-9 combination shows up as "10", not "20", but settles the bet correctly if you stand. And due to screen size limitation, you must stand on any six card hand; fortunately, so must the dealer.All in all, a nice toy, but not a serious blackjack trainer.
0	Not a top quality blackjack toy for the money: The blackjack game does not exhibit odds. You can't double-down on multiple hands (Las Vegas permits you doing this). The hit button is overly sensitive--two cards are dealt instead of one. I question about the true randomness of the cards dealt.
0	XR41s and Tri-whammers: Okay so I made those words up. They're not actual military terms. Buried in this Tom Clancy book though, I doubt that anyone except submarine and naval experts would even notice. I've never heard of an author doing TOO much research for a book. I think Clancy lost touch with the everyday reader if he thinks anyone would understand enough of the jargon he spews here to care about this book. And when jargon is all a book offers (characters? what characters?) the book, to put in simple, non-Clancian terms, SUCKS! Clearly it's not the dumbest book I've ever read, but it is the worst. I make it a mission never to stop a book once I've started, and never to refuse reading a book given to me. This book made me question the value of such a mission. Too boring, too long, too technical, too empty.
0	A good idea made into a bad novel: This novel is very long and boring.When Clancy describes the submarine battles,the text results heavy and very difficult to follow.In fact,the novel contains too many technical details about the weapons.The book would be better if it contained more references about the persons.And I have to say that I think that this novel has a excess of 400 pages.(The Spanish edition of Plaza y Janes has almost1000 pages in small format)
1	Greatest contemporary war story ever written: I read this book while stationed in Germany in the late eighties and its still one of the greatest reads I've ever had....The story is so believable, especially if you've been to the cities he writes about, as well as having trained for such a scenario...great book
0	Severe Printing Errors: I have not yet read the entire book, though I do quite enjoy what I have read, this edition of the novel suffers from some very severe printing errors. Namely, the first 3 chapters or so are out of sync with the rest of the book. The first page of the book is page16, and there seems to be fragments of a forward and an author's note printed throughout this section. The rest of the book appears okay, though.
0	crap: This was pretty crap none of the kids like them and they are not amazing at all. My kids threw them in the trash first day, just a waste of money
0	its a rip off.: There is only ONE page of useful info in the entire book. I am not kidding! ONE page. Everything else is fluff to sell a book. I thought it might be fun to read in bed w/ my girlfriend...negative.the one page has a fairly accurate diagram of the vagina w/ some arrows that say "rub here."Everything else was crap.And a waste of time.I guess if you are a terrible lover who doesn't try and please your woman - it could be marginally useful but not in comparison to most texts out there.If you know it's important to get your girl turned on before going to work than all you need out of this book is that one page. Look it up on the net and save your money.
0	Not A Toy: It's actually a very poorly made and easily damaged costume. The purple color comes off in a strong breeze. Therefore it is very overpriced. Mine arrived with the fabric pre-ruined, but I don't have time or funds to make/buy another costume. You are much better off just buying a wig and putting the rest of the costume together yourself.
1	Zumo 550: The Zumo works great. It's well built, water proof and easy to use. I was able to down load a route like I wanted and it followed it to a tee (you have to set it to "Off Road" mode). The fuel gage is nice to have it gives you a heads up before the low fuel light comes on. I wish it would show the speed limit like my Nuvi does. I would recommend it and I would buy another one.
1	Great for Motorcycle: If you ride a bike you need one of these. The only complaint I have is with the bluetooth. It has two channels of bluthooth but has a very limited amount of phones that it will work with. Most of them are very old model. If you hook up a phone not on the list it will pair up but if you also pair up a headset then it goes crazy. Once I found an old phone (Motorla RAZR) it works great.
1	Takes a licking and ...: I take the unit off the bike every time I stop(I don't trust the locking screw).One time I did not fully secure the GPS into the cradle.While going down the road at 50+ miles per hour it flew off.I thought great there's $600 down the drain.I circled back and picked up the device.It was banged up in a few places (the corners were completely scuffed).I turned it on and it WORKED!I have fully tested it and everything works (it's now15+ days since the incident).All-in-all a good GPS for those of us who are a little rough on our hardware.
0	Broke down in 3 weeks: Product just quit working 3 weeks after I got it. Sent it back to manufacturer (Garmin) who said they would have it fixed on a priority and over-nighted back to me. That was almost two weeks ago and have not gotten it back yet. Still waiting.
1	Great GPS: Even though the price is more than what I wanted to pay, it was worth it. I like the choices of voices and ease of use. Like all GPSs, you have to get use to inaccuracies during your trip. It's good to study your route before heading out. Sometimes common sence is better than the GPS itself. Battery life is good. Just wish it would work with my current cell phone (EnV).
1	Love it: Though the price is something you have to consider most, I love the vest, style, quality and even the color. My son got the blue one and he loves it from the beginning. It's very soft, comfortable and stylist that helps him floating very well, of course with the help of his father to make his head up. It doesn't take long for a 2-year-old boy to get used to it too. Not like the fabric vest, this one doesn't stick to his skin and it dries out very quick. We had a very good time in the pools and had a hard time to pull him out of the water. Absolutely a good purchase, it deserves every penny.
1	So cute!: This hat is honestly one of the very cutest things I have bought for my daughter thus far. Everyone comments on it wherever we go and thankfully, there is plenty more room for her to grow into it!It's been machine washed and dryed several times with no problems. No fading, fraying, shrinking, or pilling.Super cute!
0	the big town (vhs): My Husband wanted the movie on dvd but all I could find was vhs so I ordered it for him he loved it the first time he watched it but the second time he tried to watch it it wouldn't work . It would not trac.
1	An interesting lady: This was a good book. It was a bit long, in that the whole book is based off of one day. It was interesting, in that I wanted to see what would happen to Miss Pettigrew, overall a good book, glad I got to read it.
0	Not the Sims 2: I do not like this game at all. The graphics are awful. I even like the first Sims for the Playstation than this one. I feel I was ripped off paying $50.00 for this farce. I have the Sims 2 for the PC and all the expansion packs and I love that game. I feel like I'm getting somewhere on that one. You can't shut the aging off so don't know if on this game they age or not. Don't know if the they even have kids and if they age or not. Also they work 7 days a week just like in the first one. I don't recommend anyone buying this one. I wouldn't buy any of the other ones they have either because if they are anything like this one it's just a rip off.When I went to make people I didn't get many choices on anything and the people looked and walked just like they did on the first one. They should never have called this one Sims 2 because it sure isn't.
1	From jazz to eternity: Starting with some hot but slightly populist swing, then turning to schmultzy (this word doesn't exist, but I think you get my drift) pop evergreen and then covering the field from top class jazz and blues to country... Dinah really shines at this CD, trust me on that one or listen yourself.A jazz fan like myself could wish for a jazzier selection, but then again, jazz fans probably already have some of her fienst jazz work (tributes to Bessie Smith, jamming with Clark Terry, Maynard Ferguson, Clifford Brown, Hank Jones, Terry Gibbs, Buck Clayton and others; swinging hard with Lionel Hampton or Red Norvo...).This is a perfect introduction to Dinah Washington's entire career and her vastly diverse opus.Hopefully, it will lead some to explore her jazz legacy (not as consistently excellent as Sarah Vaughan's jazz-opus, but equally great and powerful when she hits it right with her mighty voice).
1	Gimme a piece of BEEFCAKE!!: Beefcake is a documentary and a gem of a movie all rolled into one. Its focal point is the physique magazines of the 40's and 50's. The director shows the steamier and more homoerotic side (as if it needed more of one) of these magazines. It also covers how they came to be and why they dissappeared off of magazine shelves. Before watching the movie i knew very little about it except that it was gay themed and discussed muscle boys. Even though i really couldnt care less for muscle boys, i still watched the movie and i am glad i did.. It's colors are very visually stimulating and the images are great.. The documentary moments are amusing and the film moments are even funnier. I would reccomend this movie to anyone who wants to laugh and just enjoy a good movie.
1	Stamina Electronic Mini-Stepper: The stepper is tough to use at first but that's probably because I'm out of shape. I've used it several times but not on a regular basis. The only probably I have is that it's hard to maintain your balance at times. Otherwise, it's a great little exercise medium for the price and I like it because it's small enough to put away anywhere.
1	A Great must have book: This thing really works. I tried the exercises and noticed HUGE improvement in my memory and the ability to visualize things in a way I had never dreamed before.
1	Best Book!: This is the best book in the field of creativity and accelerated learning!!! After only15 minutes, I felt that my brain had a really good and hard workout.
0	Can You Say - Stuffing The Ballot Box?!?: At the time of this writing, when I click on 'See all 91 reviews' ALL OF THE 5 STAR REVIEWS on the page (reviews1-10) are written by a reviewer who has reviewed ONLY THIS BOOK! Since 7 of these10 reviews ARE 5 star reviews I either have to conclude that this book is the most sensational book of the century and inspires people who have never written another review ever to sign up on Amazon to do just that for this book OR the ballot box is being stuffed here. Read the more measured reviews and the astute reader will be able to easily discern which of these two possibilities is true...I, personally, don't like it when the seller himself or reviewers associated with the seller do not identify themselves as such when reviewing a product!
0	Pseudociencia: Este libro y el sitio mantenido por Win Wenger son un claro ejemplo de la pseudociencia al estilo de la Dianética y la Cientología. Tengan cuidado con otro ejemplo de pseudo ciencia: Tony Buzán y sus mapas mentales. Todos estos ejemplos tiene como común denominador prometer hacerlo más inteligente de lo que es. Creanme, sean inteligentes y no compren dichos libros. Se harán un gran favor. Mejor visiten sitios como el de James Randi quien se dedica a desenmascarar a charlatanes y pseudo cientificos como Wanger, Buzan, Hubbard, Uri Geller y otros.
1	Not bad: The technique of "Image Streaming" has shown promising results in certain cases. Much of the hype and propoganda, however, has been that the process can create a 20 point gain in IQ, relying on the1989 study by Dr. Charle P. Reinert, the "Reinert Study". The following link will take you to the abstract -http://www.themindaccelerator.com/research/rp2.htmThe study, however, does not detail a 20 point gain in IQ through image streaming, unless I am reading the abstract wrong. It discusses a much lower gain, less than half the advertised 20 point gain in certain circumstances. As for the validity of the test, not enough detail is noted in the abstract for one to objectively judge for themselves. Unfortunately, this discrepnancy has resulted in a diminished outlook on this technique to several persons. It is unfortunate, because the technique is worth learning and can be very beneficial when combined with other cognitive techniques, such as the Sedona Method.
1	DYNOOOO-MITE: I love this CD - Weezer and Pavement fans listen up - this CD is for you! The band uses topics such as supermodels (Dear Kate), pro-sports (G-force) and arguments with girlfriends (Anyway) to propel you into their world. My favorite song is Oltram. And the "Boyz in the Hood" cover - it'll definately stick in your head with it's melodious and rythmic quirkiness. Check it out now before it releases nationally on May 23rd. Also look for them on Farmclub.com (tv show that airs Mondays10p central) These guys made my day. Thanks Austin, TX!
1	Decent CD: The Remake of Boyz-n-the-Hood makes this CD worth buying by itself, but there are some other catchy tunes that are worth listening to also.
1	Impress Your Friends: Here is a golden opportunity for fans of alternative music to look terribly intelligent...buy this CD now, and when it is the hottest thing going this summer, you'll be the one who "saw it coming".Yes, the cover of "Boyz" is good--hysterically good--but the rest of the CD will grab you as well. Every now and then you'll discover a new song on it and find it has found its way back into your player.Great music and a chance to be a musical sage. Check it out!
1	Thank God there's a place "ware" I can find this on CD: Great album from great singer. I first heard it just a few weeks ago when I found an original1979 cassette copy from a place near my house that specializes in records and old tapes. In almost no time the disco-ish "What's Your Name" became one of my very favorite songs.
0	Bad Remake: This song when sung by Berlin was wondeful and not vocally overdone. Jessica Simpson sounds as if she is ripping her vocal chords out to hit some of the notes towards the end of the song. None of the remixed are particularly exciting and they all drag on without end. Unfortunetly, it seems as if this entire cd was rushed and hurried along; I would save my $$!
0	Dropped it and it broke: I bought the 810 model, which is similar. Worked generally fine, but because of its shape, easy to drop or fall over. I put it on top of my desktop, and accidentally it fell on the wooden floor, and since then, it has not turned on. Too fragile.
0	Don't do it !!: The first time I tried this, it damaged the camera's lens cover mechanism. The little hooks that hold it to the lense poke into the area where the covers exit the mechanism, causing it to stop working. Do not buy or use this product!!!
0	Disappointed: I'm a big Louis Prima fan but I was very disappointed with this cd. It didn't capture the excitement of a Louis Prima show.
1	The Importance of Community Development: Through statistical and qualitative analysis, this book illustrates the importance of community-wide development as a key to the economic rejuvenation of the inner city. The analysis is comprehensive and provides an excellent resource for individuals and entities involved in community development.
1	Good overall account of the war in the South: I recommend this book for those interested in a clear ande concise narrative account of the American Revolution in the South. Although not as dramatic as Buchanan's THE ROAD TO GUILFORD COURTHOUSE (which I do not recommend) Lumpkin's book is well worth reading and generally accurate. His analysis is solid, a description I would not give to THE ROAD TO GUILFORD COURTHOUSE.
0	Good idea, but not practical: We bought this so that the stroller could have shade from the front. It was hard to put on and keep stable, and the parts broke easily. Not worth it!
1	An overlooked treasure: This is one of the funniest SF books out there. I've got an old tattered copy, and I will order the new edition when it comes out. The book is full of cultural, SF and fandom references. Some might be a little dated (for example, the symbol of the sheep, the horned box, is a reference to a TV with antenna, and how many people have seen one of THOSE lately?), but overall, this book holds up very well.To answer another reviewer's question would be a spoiler, but anyone who wishes to know who Purple was based on can email me at my nickname at hotmail.
1	One of the greatest jazz records ever!: I absolutely love Tom Grants music and this record (the view from here) is a fantastic album...infact one of his best! I have seen Tom Grant live many times and he is an amazing performer and puts on an amazing live show..For anyone who buys this CD you will not be disappointed...It is truely a great cd and Tom Grant is one of the all smooth jazz greats!Regards,J.Fitzgerald
0	Animated Dean Martin Doll: I really find it difficult to rate this item for the following reason. I purchased the Dean Martin doll as a novelty item for my wife, a dedicted Dean Martin fan. Unfortunately it did not perform as expected. The mouth would not move. Fortunately I was able to return it for a full refund paid in a timely manner.
1	My daughter loves these books!: I was given our first book by Sandra Boynton as a gift when my daughter was just 6 months old. I have since then bought several more of her books and my daughter loves each.and.every.one of her books that we own! Sandra Boynton's books were literally the first books that really caught my daughter's attention and we read them every day. She is almost 8 months old now and I think she'll love them as she grows older as well. I highly recommend any of her books!
0	This book is awful!: This book has no point to it. It teaches you common sense stuff. It has no value in real life. This book is very boring and useless. A student can not read this book, it is too boring and useless. Waste of Money. This is a waste of [$]. If you have already bought this book, it can be used as pretty good fire wood, and that's what the one star is for.
1	Excellent strategy game!: I got this game for my birthday (I'm 35) and I love it! It's like a high-tech version of chess. Definitely makes you think hard and try to plot out your moves many steps in advance. It's especially tricky because you have to simultaneously think offensively and defensively. If you like classic strategic boardgames, you'll love this game.
0	CHEAP!: I was really excited about getting this for my brother for Christmas, but when we opened the package, the lasers would not fire and we could never get them to work, which is the whole point of the game, so it's pretty much trash now.
1	It makes you think: It makes you think really hard - its like chess on crack. Its the new age of chess. I don't like the form fitting box top which required resetting the pieces in a certain way to put away the game, but this probably provides better protection for the mirror surfaces.
1	9yo Son loves this game: I will start off by saying I have not personally played this game. I don't really like chess so am not super excited to play. But my son really wanted this for Christmas. I was a little leary of getting it because we have had laser games that didn't work very well in the past and ended up being a waste of money. But there wasn't much he wanted for Christmas and the reviews on Amazon were good so I got it for him.He loves it! Him and my boyfriend have played numerous times since Christmas and they are both addicted to it. My boyfriend keeps begging me to play it with him when my son isn't around. The lasers are very strong and neither of them have complained about having any issue with it working.It also seems to be very fast play. I don't think it takes them more than 20 minutes to finish a game.And I love the fact that it isn't something that has to be plugged into a TV to play and it makes you think and strategize.
1	One of the all-time best jazz singers: In the pantheon of jazz greats, I don't think it's an exaggeration to say that Nina Simone stands right up there alongside greats such as Billie Holliday. Her work even compares favorably with the instrumental giants like Coltrane or Davis; she's that good. This cd is my favorite from Simone's catalog, "Love Me or Leave Me" my favorite song. While less socially relevant than some of the other songs on this cd, it will leave YOU wanting to dance.However, ALL of the songs on this cd are great. Some make you want to boogie (yes, I said it), some make you angry, some make you want to cry, but regardless, it's hard not to be affected in some way by each of them. I'd also recommend Verve's "Nina Sings Nina" cd.
0	not for me: A reasonable price and a good beginning but what seemed to be a thriller turned into a slow love story with some mystery thrown in. Wasn't my cup of tea.
1	My first ADF book!: This book was my first exposure to Alan Dean Foster. I though the beginning was somewhat slow, but it was character development. I really loved the pendju, but I was upset when I conc was introduced. As the story continued to progress, I decided that it was actually for the better, and turned out to be an excellent book. I just wish it was longer/had a sequel... =)
1	little train that couldn't: The batteries don't last very long and the train has stopped working after a year of minimal use. It still makes the sounds but no longer moves. I love the train but would never spend this much again.
0	tried today: today was the first day with it. I have noticed no difference in appetite. directions say it may take a few days.It tastes fine.
0	No Taste: I bought these k-cups at the store to try out in my Keurig single cup coffee maker, they are horrible. Absolutely no french vanilla taste at all, it's not just a weak taste, there is NO TASTE! And to make sure it wasn't just my taste buds, I made several more cups (using1 k-cup per mug of coffee of course) for family members to see if they could guess what flavor it was, none of them knew and when I told them it was french vanilla, they were of course surprised since you can't taste anything at all.I will never buy Van Houtte again, what a waste of money.
0	How do you expect people to purchase this item?: The product description states that the sizing is based on neck size, however you don't provide any measurement with the corresponding S,M,L sizes. Are we supposed to guess at the measurements? It might be easier to shoot darts blind-folded!
0	Kindle version is Not illustrated.: It says illustrated, in my table of contents, but it is not. I only purchased this to have the illustrated version.
1	A classic with a beautiful wrapping: Wonderful book, timeless advice... plus Maira Kalman!! Her exquisite illustrations pair wonderfully with this major classic.
0	Great music, terrible DVD: What's the deal? I am a huge ABB fan, and thought this was a great show. But what the hell is up with these stupid interviews in the middle of songs... right in the middle of solos. Seriously, who would do such a stupid thing. It would be a great DVD if they had the whole show, uninterrupted. Why not just put the interviews in a whole different section or disc. If you want an Allman Brothers DVD, just get the new one from the Beacon... and hope somebody finally realizes that this DVD sucks and fixes it.
0	Disgraceful: This DVD is a disgrace. Pathetic. It's actually an outstanding film of an Allman Brothers concert, but the producers ruined it by interrupting the songs with interviews. How can they be so stupid? How can the members of The Allman Brothers allow the record company to butcher the songs like that? Don't they have enough interest in their own music to pay attention to what gets released? If you want to see the full length versions of the songs in this concert, buy the VHS version because it's all there. As for the DVD release, it's such a shame that corporations and record labels show such disrespect for music. The Allman Brothers are one of the greatest live bands of all time and there isn't very much concert footage that has been released, so why did they have to ruin this wonderful concert?
0	Like others say, stay away from the DVD!: When I bought this and took it home. I played it and was severely dissapointd. Ditto to what most other reviewers said. I took it back to Best Buy the next day. It sucks!
1	Any true Allman Borthers fan would enjoy this DVD: The sound and picture quality are great and the selection of tunes are great also. The only annoying thing was the cut in interviews in the middle of a few songs. Overall a good DVD
0	Misleading information on DVD case.: I'm disappointed like the rest. I bought the VHS version several years ago and expected an exact copy of it on the DVD. WRONG!!! To make matters worse the DVD cover says "Running Time: Approx. 90 minutes" The ACTUAL running time is 55 minutes. What a rip-off!!
0	I am glad I didn't trade in my Laserdisc!: what an incredible botch job! the laserdisc rocks! and I understand so does the vhs version...but this DVD cuts out songs...cuts up songs...and generally dissapoints...THE INTERVIEWS SHOULD BE IN ADDITION TO...NOT ..instead off SONY..get it right! and put this out AGAIN!
1	Eye Opening!: Read this book if you don't know anything about the writings of St. Paul so you can get it right straight away. Read this book if you have read others about the writings of St. Paul, for an enhanced understanding of what you think you understand about him.
0	Not a "practical handbook" for today.: This is a reprint of a book first issued in1930. It does have some fascination, for instance in the comparison of gas vs. oil lighting for your workspace. For my purposes as a beginner looking for basic methods for mechanical watch cleaning and repair, it was practically useless.It gives equal time to fusee and Geneva watches and may well be of interest to an experienced person looking for a glimpse into the past, but not reccomended as a "practical handbook."
0	I cannot rate as I have not purchased.: For over $18.00, you do not give the quantity of cans one will purchase. I'm sure one can does not cost that much. Thank you, Iva Jeane Driggers
0	I struggled to pick it up...: Never have I been so bored by a novel set in Ireland. While I found the historical aspect to be informative, the story itself was tedious and silly, with the most contrived fictional characters. I struggled to pick this book up each night (rather than put it down). I would rather read a straight history book and visit Dublin for my facts, and leave the Irish fiction to Emma Donoghue and even Maeve Binchy.
1	A Good Family Game: My eight year old son received this gift for Christmas this year and he, my husband, our six year old daughter and I all played it about five times so far. It's a nice game to play together for a variety of ages and doesn't get too competitive. It's a challenge to remember the titles of movies, characters, and even offers other challenges such as having to figure out the difference between two almost identical pictures, etc.There is even two ways to play the game, a short version and a longer regular version. You do need to be by a working TV and DVD player, but it is enjoyable and the children tend to get a kick out of seeing the video clues for many questions.I recommend this for a family or group of children old enough to work the remote of the family's DVD player. (They even have the rules on the DVD!!)
1	better than 95% of what's in your CD player: there it was,1991. i heard black metalic for the fist time and i melted into the soundscape that is the catherine wheel. cruising in a car wasn't good enough for the record because the mellower moments couldn't be audible with out blowing your ear drums on the loud parts. god bless this band, they take dynamics are taken to the max. wishville combines the catherine wheel's major strength (dynamics) and combines it with pure pop sensibility. they've nearly perfected that which is the catherine wheel.
0	.....what happened?: truly a disappointment. and that's only because Catherine Wheel need to be held at a very high standard. they have produced some fine masterpieces in the past, culminating with the show (and heart) -stopping Adam and Eve. additionally, when you have the huge talents of Tim Friese-Greene at your disposal (he created a large part of two other masterpieces, Talk Talk's Spirit of Eden and Laughing Stock - get them), you best not surface with mediocrity. well, they have. there's no texture, no diversions, no heavily-lidded emotion, no cathartic, blissful moments of sound.new record label..... firing of their bassist (? )..... many bands have tried to shake things up mid-career, hate to see another talented one follow the same fate.i'm still a fan, but this album will surely go to the bottom of (the) Catherine Wheel bin for me.
1	This game is Sweet.: If you want codes I got codes only one but its Sweet.You can get a rocket launcher by typing in this code when your hunting and you don't just want to kill it you want to blow it away that code is BHB-BQ
1	Good for my first pistol: A decent priced case for my first gun. Easily fit a 9mm Sig, along with a mag and 2x50 round boxes. Wasn't looking for anything fancy, and it delivered just what I was looking for.
0	Good case, cheap foam insert: This case is strongly made and closes well. However, the included foam inserts are very cheap and offer no support. After carefully making cut-outs for my XD-9, I found that the foam was too feeble to support the gun properly and just looked cheap and saggy.After a difficult search on the web, I discovered another case maker, Pelican (on ebay), that sold replacement foam inserts, which I ordered. I found these to be of far better quality and well support the gun and accessories.In the end, it would have been cheaper and easier to have just bought the case from Pelican in the first place.To be honest, even the Pelican foam is not as good as the foam I used to use in the UK to carry heavy cameras in alluminum cases. That foam had a velvet surface and was extremely firm, but God only knows where to buy that!
1	Great product: I looked at another pistol case in a store that was selling for the same price, and this one was much, much better. For what they're charging, I don't think you can beat the quality. The shipping was most prompt as well.
1	does what it's supposed to do: Got this for my Ruger P95. Plenty of room for the gun, both15 round clips and the speed loader.
1	agood quality case: I bought this particular case for my CO2 pistol and was able to get the pistol, 5 co2 cartridges and one 350 count bb tube into it.
1	Excellent for revolver storage: You can't beat this for the price for storing a handgun. I keep a S&W 357 magnum and 3 speedloaders in the case. Quality is good overal plastic. The latches work fine and appear to be decent for plastic.
1	For public radio insiders and those who wished they were.: If you're a public radio fan wanting to know what Garrison Keillor is really like, or how angry Bob Edwards actually got when he exited Morning Edition unwillingly after almost 25 years as host, this is not the book for you. It is a highly readable, highly personal perspective on the philosophies and politics that shaped NPR and made public radio a force in American media. Those most apt to appreciate it are among the thousands of people who have been employed in public radio over the last 30 years -- including career veterans who will recognize the names and remember the events that Mitchell recalls.
1	Excellent as a drama on the lives of prostitutes but only fair as a thriller: Intelligent if slightly awkward melding of a gritty, sad drama of life of the street for working classprostitutes in the UK, and a somewhat more melodramatic and soapy (if sometimes quite tense)serial killer thriller.Unlike `Klute' where the world of hustling and thriller melded seamlessly, here there is a bit moreschizophrenia between the elements. For me, the crime sections, while sometimes effective, werealso quite familiar, and felt like TV and movies I'd seen many times before, whereas the portrait ofthe day to day lives of hustlers felt like much more interesting and less often explored in anon-exploitive way. The killings and investigation feel oddly grafted on.
0	Welcome to1995!: I am so sick of these things being released without CDMA/EVDO or some cell service. From Nokia of ALL COMPANIES!Get with the times and offer an internet device that doesn't require me to be in 50 feet of a damn router.
1	Pequeño y cumplidor: El Nokia N800 es muy practico para el uso diario por su reducido tamaño, su bateria dura lo justo para el uso que se le puede dar. Logicamente por lo limitado en tamaño de su pantalla no sustituye a un Laptop pero si ayuda mucho para estar conectado a la internet y mantenerse comunicado con los amigos y relacionados.
1	Great for my needs: I wanted a device that could give me the web browsing capabilities and mp3 player without the price and weight of a laptop. This fits the requirements well. It requires some tinkering to get things just right. If you don't want to tinker, get an iPod touch. Otherwise this is great.
1	best gadget ever...: im writing this review from my n800 nice device, a lot of app, nokia releases a new os evry 2 months, i liked it!
0	Does not power up after initial charge: This item arrived DOA after initial Charge. The replacement also did not start after initial charge. I was able to get it to start after removing the battery for 5 hours. Then it worked great until I powered down, then the same problem. I could not get the update software to find the device even though windows Xp found and gave it a drive designation. I thought upgrading the OS system would fix the power problem. Nokia support could not help, I was told to send the unit in for warranty repair. When it was working for the short time it was promising. Maybe just a bad batch, I think I'll order the N810 instead and cross my fingers.
1	Great Puzzle: I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of this puzzle. Good chunky pieces that the little ones can handle and all tidies away into a great little case. Well worth the price and makes a great gift for toddlers learning their association and coordination.
1	Fear: From the boy next door to every girls worst nightmare in a heart beat. A thriller that lets you love and hate the same character at the same time. Twists and turns keep your eyes glued to the television and Mark Walbergs gentle stare keeps you loving a psychotic. The ending keeps those who enjoyed the movie hoping for more. An ending scene with police divers keeps those who noticed it wondering, was he alive or was he dead? Just who's body were they looking for?
0	Umm... Nah: Well this movie started off semi-enjoyable. An early shower scene of Reese Witherspoon made me happy. Thie movie sets up with a father-daughter conflict that you've seen in hundreds of other movies. Enter Marky Mark, sweeping the girl off her feet. Then comes the part when the girl argues a lot with the father. And so on... we've all seen this before. It seems like the writer ran out of ideas at the end of the movie, though. Or perhaps he was getting bored with all the build-up he was creating with the characters that he was just like "Alright, screw the rest of the plot, lets get to the action." And so he does. And soon after the movie ends at a seemingly premature1hr.16min. Woohoo.Don't waste your money on this DVD, or even the rental, they play it all the time on USA or the like.
0	Terrible Service: I am completely annoyed with this company. I ordered a movie and they sent the wrong one. Instead of just sending me the right one, they are making me go through this ridiculous process by sending the other one back before they send the right one even though it was their mistake. It was supposre to be a christmas gift and basically it was ruined.
1	The Very Best: This is quite possibly one of the ten finest Albums/CDs every recorded. The Byrds at this time were the best the 60s had to offer and the 60s was the time period that mattered. The songwriting by Crosby in particular was genius. I love the Byrds, I miss Gene Clark, and I only wish this early version of the Byrds could have given us even more output before the break-ups and decline into the "Rodeo" format. Yes, the muscianship of "Mcguin's" country Byrds was truly groundbreaking but the songwriting was not even close. Get this one for a real trip.
0	not delivered: thanks for nothing. I sent this product to Qatar. now some random guy in Vegas has a new prisma color art set for free. and there is no way I can contact anyone. $230 right Out the window.
0	way too violent for children: we just rented this movie and while my 9-year old liked it, my 6-year old was terrified, with good reason. Lots of violence and cruelty that just went on and on. I had some Babar books as a child and was expecting something similar- I was shocked and angry that someone decided to turn it into some kind of a cartoon Tarentino movie. Yes, eventually Babar does prevail, but in the meantime, there's enough graphic scary imagery to fuel many kid nightmares. Too many kid movies today seem to be designed for adults, and this is definitely one
0	Buffalo Girls: The original version of this movie was great. Huston is superb as Calamity Jane, and Melanie Griffith is a great madame.But this version has been hacked to death by some uncaring editor. It has lost it's continuity and is very dissappointing.
0	North to the Orient (Harbrace Paperbacks Library): This particular printing may be authentic to the period but the print is very difficult to read. It is dizzying.
0	iLuv I707BLK iPod FM Transmitter: This is a neat device and works quite well. DO NOT BUY ONE FOR AN 8GIG 5th GENERATION iPod. YOU WILL HAVE TO EXTENSIVELY MODIFY IT TO FIT. Well, Mrs. Lincoln, other than the shooting, how was the play? Also, iLuv is snotty about it not fitting. It took hours to cut the slot bigger, knock off the two tabs, then measure and epoxy the holder to the unit in the proper position. iLuv could easily make an inexpensive adapter! It works fine now, however.UPDATE: This device does NOT seem to charge my iPod when it is plugged in to it AND if you leave the iPod in the device in also seems to DISCHARGE the iPod.
1	still working: I've had this unit now for two years and it still works like a champ for an FM transmitter. There's static on some channels when I travel, but I'm competing against much higher bandwidth. Worth the money for someone looking to just enjoy their tunes without a full audio facelift.
1	loved it: my baby is10 months old and fits very comfortable in this, the fabric that covers it is great quality and is very flexible and easy to inflate, but not to easy to fold back in the original shape to fit in the bag.
0	Suggested Age.....6 years??????: I think that the only reason that the manufacturer recommends this "toy" for ages 6 and up is to avoid a law suit, they don't want to be responsible for any baby drownings or injuries. The only thing I can think of that my 7 year old would do with this is to play water frisbee. I used to like products from this manufacturer but if they cannot even stand behind their own product safety then it is time to make a return. Don't buy this if you haven't yet, it is not worth your babies safety.
0	Waste of money: It would be safer to have just held my son. We thought this was cool becasue we wouldn't have to blow it up, but no....that's not the problem, now the problem is he just falls forward so his face is in the water....! I'd much rather waste my breath to blow up a floater so my son can keep his breath free of water. Nice waste of money, if they ever redesign this, the need to try to make it more stable. It's not like we just stuck him in there once & gave up on it, we've tried this thing over & over again months upon months to see if maybe it was his age...nope it's the item, even when other children try it, it's the same thing. Please don't buy this & look away from your child for a second, you could be making a horrible mistake.
1	Read the manufacturers recom age!!!: According to the manufacturer this toy is for 6 YEARS and up! Fun for OLDER kids!
1	Super fun float for my toddler: My son who is going to be 2 soon simple loves this float. He hates getting into our bath tub and used to cry a lot. So when i came across this float on Amazon i wondered if it will ever be used, but just gave it a shot and Lo and Behold...... it was magic!!!! my son sits in it in the pool and keeps singing to himself. This float is pretty sturdy and doesnt topple. And the netted area between the 2 concentric tubes makes it all the more fun as the water becomes reachable for the kid to play and splash but at the same time keeping him safe :) He is hyper active when inside the pool, jumping crazy and stuff but still the float stands sturdy!!! The air seems to go out if not used for 2-3 days, donno if its common or not, but i have a balloon pump that comes in handy. i recommend to parents who want their kids to like water :)
1	Wedding planning with a twist!: Carolyn is a wedding planner that helps plan a wedding for Sheik Tarik's sister which is only a month away. Carolyn is surprised that the bride & groom are not involved in the planning at all. Sheik Tarik is planning everything which keeps her wondering why. As they get to know each other Carolyn & Sheik Tarik begin to fall in love. Of course there are misunderstandings but they work them out... until Carolyn learns that the wedding is arranged and against the sister's wishes. There are some good twists and turns throughout the story which keeps things interesting. I enjoyed reading this book and hope you will like it too. There is a sequel to this book on Carolyn's friend Anne called "Taming the Sheik" by Carol Grace. One of the sheik's cousins mentioned in this book is the hero in the sequel. Enjoy!
0	product never worked. manufacturer does not stand behind their product.: This product ruined at least 3 brand new batteries. Amazon refuses to do anything about it and the manufacturer will not stand behind their product. I will never use amazon or a schumacher product again. If the product is "as is" I may as well buy it used for a fraction of the cost.
0	Horrified: My husband got this as a hand me down and started reading it today. I glanced at the page he had open and am horrified at what I read. Page 8 in the grey box titled "Age Differences" and I quote "For the first 6 months, infants do not feel love and affection. They are wholly dependent on their caretakers to have their needs met-that's all". What old school garbage! As a mother of a 3 week old it's already obvious to me that my daughter feels love and affection.
0	Really pretty lame: There really isn't anything new in here and just states the obvious like don't beat your kids and love them. Not worth the money.
0	A mistake: I accidently bought two copies of this DVD. Most of the people who gave it 5 stars had to be gaming the system.
1	ONE OF THE BEST MOVIES MADE: Please come out with a DVD version of this masterpiece as soon as possible. I saw this movie many years ago, and never thought I'd see it again. If it had not been for all your reviews, I would not have known it was this movie. Yes, this is the ultimate 'primitive' movie...definitely much better than 'Clan of the Cave Bears'. Here are the things you'll see : hairy cavemen, cannibals, neanderthals, sabre-tooth tigers, mammoths, pigmies, great landscapes and sceneries. The movie will humble you and make you think how precious the most basic necessities of life really is. You'll experience love, sex, tribal wars, sadness, humor. And for the last time, forget the historical experts that always claim some movie is bad because its historically inaccurate. I won't trade this movie for 99% of the Hollywood movies out there today!
1	Quest for fire review: My recent purchase of "Quest for fire" from Amazon.com was a great experience. The DVD arrived on time and in very good condition. The film was a joy to see again. the screening went very well, as the movie was very clear with great sound. I highly recommend Amazon.com for your next DVD purchase.
1	Skechers Chiefs Sneakers: Nice shoes for a good price. Cant beat that for growing boys! And they love the easy on/off style.
1	Good: Does not surpass War All The Time but still pretty f-ing solid. Check out Autumn Leaves Revisited.
0	Kindle version has problems: This Kindle version of the book has quite a few typographical errors. I could usually make them out, but it IS irritating. This review is for this version of the book not "Boots And Saddles" itself (which I found to be a very enjoyable read!).
1	Exactly what we wanted: I found this by scanning the bar code of a friends hat. We got the package quickly and it was exactly what we ordered.
0	Too Much Attitude: Bridgewater's theatrical experience definitely works against her on this CD. The vocal posturing annoys and distracts. Her material is excellent, and her band really cooks. Drop the coy mannerisms and just sing, Dee Dee.
1	The Bishop's Wife: One of my favorite Christmas movies, I have watched it every year. Still a classic film with a wonderful cast. They can remake it over and over this will always be my favorite
1	A Beautiful Story: No blood or guts... just wonderful characters showing what love really is ! Don't miss seeing this one if you haven't already. Great for Christmas!
1	gasket cement for Big Green Egg: This is the best cement I've yet used for keeping my replacement gasket in place on my Big Green Egg. I'm now using a fiberglass stove gasket, and it's worked the best of any I've tried. This is easy to apply and holds up to the heat better than the black stuff I used before.
0	Vague Explanations: This book contains very good practice material but the explanations to the answer choices are very vague and difficult to understand.
0	It's not worth it; it's a waste of time: This is a very good if you need a brush up on the very basics like percentage and fractions. This is the first 200 pages and it is very easy. It gives you a sense of achievement and wrongly makes you think you will ace the SAT. The SAT is not this easy...The harder concepts are poorly explained. Explanations to practice questions and tests are extremely shallow and vague. Some of the techniques are much too convoluted and take too much time. There are better strategies than what this book offers.
0	If These Walls Could Talk 2 (2000 TV Movie): THe song of the title menu sung by two women in the same beautiful style of THE FLOWER DUET from LAKMÉ by Delibes, is Antonio Vivaldi's Concerto in G major for two guitars/mandolins , ADAGIO. I don't know who is performimg the beautiful song. I have been trying to find it in other CD but it seems almost impossible. can anyone help me? israelonofre@yahoo.com.br
0	Sweetened with Sucralose: Real kettle popcorn is sweetened with sugar and is a real tasty snack.Unfortunately sugar burns in the microwave so Orville Redenbacher (ConAgra Foods) have sweetened this with sucralose.Sucralose is definitely something I wouldn't give to my kid. Read all about it online.
0	Would be a better value with quality batteries: Unit worked well for what it is, a small and versatile glue gun for small home repairs and crafts. The batteries are really really bad. And unfortunately they did not build in an adapter to use the included AC plug. That would have been helpful so that when the batteries die we could still use the unit. Bad engineering.Buy a corded gun if you are serious and never worry about batteries again.
1	You must have a copy of this book for your own!: I read Cheaper by the Dozen more than 20 years ago in Thai edition. And I bought it to all of my friend for presents. This is a book you must have in your house. Now I am about to buy the original/English version. I still read it every time I found it at the bookstore. I love this book.
1	Charming, if dated: This is a truly charming book that will make you laugh, cry, and all that jazz. It is a bit better than the movie version, and light years above the stage version. The stories of a family living with an efficiancy expert is funny enough, the fact that there are12 kids (well, actually11 b/c one dies of diptheria when she is really young) makes it all the funnier. Unfortunatly, this book is rather dated as is apparent by he considerable racism. (The Parents perform a minstrel show for their children, anything taboo is deemed "eskimo," the sterotypical portrayel of a chinease cook, etc.) Fortuately, this parts are easiyl skipped over, though they really should be cut. Read this book, it is genuinly touching and has some nice lessons about family, but I would recommend editing it before you share it with impressionable young children.
1	The book is a masterpice: I have been addicted to this real life story for over 25 years. I've starred as Mother Gilbreth on stage and also directed the production. I will be directing it again because it has everything audiences want...humor, honesty,character development and bittersweet reality. It's a family show that focuses on parenting and family unity. I'll be staging it at The Barn Theatre in Stuart Sept 24th - Oct10th. Auditions are August 8th, 9th and10th at 7pm at The Barn Theatre, 2400 E. Ocean Blvd., Stuart.
1	NOT for Modern Readers: This book should be read by everyone and anyone who is able to appreciate good Victorian literature, George Eliot's THE MILL ON THE FLOSS is one of the greatest creations. Too bad she isn't getting all the hype flowery Austen and quite dull Forster is getting in Hollywood.
1	Sublime is the Word.: From "Lady is A Tramp" to "How High the Moon" to her unique improvisation on "Mack the Knife"...Miss Ella Fitzgerald shows us that she is the jazz vocalist genius of all time. Sublime, Brilliant, Legendary...this album captures it all. A must for any Ella fan and every jazz fan.
1	Wagner out West: Most of the young stars here perform very well in a high production western that is'nt quite as good as the sum of it's parts. Wagner is'nt bad, Debra Paget is good as always but Jeff Hunter is slightly miscast, though he works quite hard. I liked the feel of time and place this film has and it still retains a sweep and grandour which must have looked great on its original cinema outing.What else can I say. I thoroughly enjoyed it even with its shortcommings and can recommend it even on repeated viewings though widescreen works best for the full-bodied western vistas.
1	Worked great: This product worked exactly as I had hoped. I did not feel like I had to keep running to the bathroom. It was controlled and effective.
1	Dr. Hahn helps to breathe life into our prayer: Dr. Hahn has performed yet another great service for the Church (and the whole world, for that matter). The Our Father is Gospel prayer, the prayer that Jesus Himself gave to us. If prayer is oxygen for the soul, then Dr. Hahn has helped to breathe life into our prayer. In the light of four Fathers of the Church, as well as his own excellent insights, Dr. Hahn, a teacher in the Teacher, teaches us how to pray.
0	Dissapointing!: Having gone through the first 3 chapters of this book, I must say I am really dissapointed. The author is supposedly trying to avoid the mathematical rigor to the account of explaining things in a physical way. Well, he almost completely fails in that and, the worst, confuses the reader. For example, he devotes15 pages to smoothly introduce the reader to the concept of a manifold, promising a more rigorous definition to be given later on. When the time comes, he uses two "brand new" concepts, namely Haussdorf space and countable base, for the meaning of which, the reader has to look up in other books!(however cited in bibliography) If one wants to understand what all these things (manifolds, diff. forms, Lie deriv, etc.) are about, the best thing to do is buy a mathematical book. After all, it is hardly possible to satisfactorily describe abstract mathematical concepts if you avoid using mathematical language! For the interested, I am NOT a mathematician.
0	False Advertising: Although this book may contain over 30,000 foods, (not just 20,000 as the synopsis claims) it only contains sodium, calorie and fat statistics for them. I bought this book looking for the potassium values that the synopsis suggested it contains. It does not. My sole purpose for purchasing this book was falsely advertised in the synopsis and thus this book is absolutely useless to me. Thanks for nothing.
0	Booo! Bad writing. Bad, bad writing.: Does anyone say "Crazy getup"? If they do, I wish they wouldn't. There's too many examples of bad cliche writing in this that I don't have time to point them all out. I was looking for a good time travel romance. This isn't it.
0	did not survive battery change: Its light was okay, although it could not quite cover an entire page of a book. The main problem is it's too shabby to survive a battery change--so you will get just 40 hours of use before it runs out. Also, finding 3V Lithium batteries is not easy.
0	Just didn't care for it.: I played a couple of adventure games (Syberia and another one I don't recall) and I got really enthralled by this game genre, so, based on everyone's review, I got this one.Technical issues aside, I just couldn't get drawn into it. The story is too new-agey, too "evil white males vs pure frolicking happy people", etc etc. I just couldn't get to care for the main character, for the plot (I found myself rooting for the bad guys), and would get annoyed at the choices I was given.After enduring the first chapter, I had enough and uninstalled it.The graphics (dated, but good) and execution (didn't encounter a single bug) save this one from a1 star rating.
0	Too Much Like Work: If I want to read a cultural history of the United States in the nineteenth century, then I read a cultural history of the United States in the nineteenth century. This boring, pretentious, rambling, self-involved, pontificating mess passes itself off as fiction, but it reads like one of those junior-high assignments where students are told to imagine themselves living in another time or place. How on earth it could have received a National Book Award is a mystery, even considering the spotty reputation of the award. One or two times I began to feel swept up in the narrative (I appreciated Bogdan's journal entries, his unrequited pining for lovely young boys), but quickly enough that narrative flow was dammed by another lengthy, boring letter or monologue. I would refer those who want to read a masterful book about an eastern European artist coming to America in the nineteenth century to read Josef Skvorecky's 'Dvorak in Love'. Now there's a book!
0	Stereo installition kit - Hyundai: The product is as described but the only thing that would fit was the side pieces. There was no place to mount the bracket to the radio. Rather than start over just taped it to radio and mounted the screws. Seems to be holding soo far.
0	African Architecture: Hugely disappointing. This book promises more than it really delivers. Having lived and worked as an architect in Africa, I found theresearch superficial and use of outdated references gives african architecture a less than positve image.I dont recoomend this book at all.
1	A moving call to re-examine the Bible: When I ordered this book, I expected it to be a defense of the Protestant position of Sola Scriptura, but to my surprise it is instead aimed at correcting liberal Christian views of how we form relationships with God. The book opens with a story of a Christian woman who was waiting for God to tell her directly that she should make amends with her estranged parents, when a friend told her to open her Bible to Exodus 20:12 and read.The book proceeds in this direction emploring the reader to use his or her Bible as a means to form a personal relationship with God rather than expecting God to speak by direct revelation. It also briefly defends the authority of the Bible against such attacks as higher criticism and the Jesus Seminar.Despite the "Why" in the title, I would have to say that it is more pastoral than apologetic. Even so, I recommend it.
1	One Tree Hill's Road Mix: I only bought this CD because I've been watching One Tree Hill from the very first season (and b/c of that hot James Lafferty, bka Nathan Scott). This CD is so good. I've listened to this CD in my car CD player for about the last 6 months!
1	Middle Eastern fever: Highly energetic and downright rowdy quartet.It's hard to tell where improv ends & Khalife begins; brilliant~This group obviously plays together seamlessly -- like the Beatles over time.I'm sending JADAL to my percussionist grandson, along with Alhaj's "When the Soul is Settled" CD. Oud masters both, yet so delightfully different.
1	Good horse - PAIN to assemble: The horse seems sturdy but to the person who said it took15 minutes to assemble they must be superman. My husband and I just finished putting it together for Christmas and it took us at least an hour. The instructions are horrible and the springs are a nightmare to hook together. We never did get the "safety" hook in. ADVICE: put on the spring covers BEFORE hooking the safety straps to the wooden pegs. The instructions say the other way around but that is impossible.It does seems sturdy though and I like the sounds. I'm sure our 2 yr old will love it in the morning.
1	grand daughter loved it: gand daughter loved it, she loves the sounds it makeswas easy to put togetherliked the safety strapswould recommend to others
1	bossa carioca: First time I heard this album was sometime 2001.Was i surprised to know that the name did not sound brazilian.Who is this singer with such a light and mellow voice it was just so very pleasing to listen to.I bought the album the following day.Some more albums in the coming days.The albums now are one of my precious collections.Hoping against hope english versions come our way soonest.jun/los angeles,ca,usa
1	A Great Find: A friend wanted this book for Christmas, and I wasn't sure I would be able to locate it in time. I was pleased to find it on Amazon and ordered it. It arrived very promptly and in excellent condition. My friend was very happy with it as a gift.
1	Change the world: I believe this book has the power to transform the way you view life. I am a teacher and I discuss this book in my class. It is always intriguing to the kids. I now raffle it off at the end of the year and I can't tell you how happy the students are to receive it. It opens their eyes to how important their thoughts and feelings are. That is a wonderful gift to give a child.
0	More than just a little bit flaky...: Well, yeah, I saw "What the *bleep* Do We Know" and got very excited and bought all of these books. While I appreciate Mr Emoto's subtley and humility in presenting his work, it winds up being just as hard to stomach that much of it is thinly veiled hoopla with little or no solid science behind it. He fails to explain how many photos he took of each kind of water he photographed for instance-- there are just too many gaping holes. But hey, what the bleep do I know? When it comes down too it, I think this sort of physics, philospohy/spiritual theory of everything-- kind of stuff is just as undocumentable and faith based as any other sort of religious ideology. More than just a little bit disappointing for those of us who are still looking.
0	A new view of water: Pretty pictures, intriguing idea, but little information to back it up. What was the methodology? Have the results been replicated? Where is the science here? Lightweight.
1	Respect for Life: I saw this book at the Dahn Yoga and Healing Centers where I attend classes. I have had basic and advanced Healing training from Dahn Yoga and our last class was how to make healing water. This book illustrates what anger and violence as well as pollution do to our bodies which are made up of 70% water. My daughter borrowed the book the day after I got it and I am waiting for her to return it. Every human being should read this book and understand how their actions react on other humans. Superb book!
1	Fabulous book for the young reader: This book is based in fact, and done so very well. I have given it only four stars as the majority of the story, such as the dialogues and day-to-day happenings, is fiction. The young reader, such as my son, may very well take that book as all fact.The author has done a great job bringing the young reader into the adventures that Lewis and Clark experienced through the use of Seaman, the dog, Her use of historical reference such as the diaries kept my the Captains and other written accounts kept by the members of the Corps of Discovery reflect the importance and difficulties of the jouney. Seaman is the comic relief in the story and keeps the young reader interested and giggling. I learned a few things by reading this book myself.As a mother and historian, I recommend this book highly for the young reader.
0	Crap, just crap: Book is highly boring as restates the same thing over and over. There is barely any thrilling action and the dog reads more like a background character than the main one. The book makes me sleep as the lewis and clark story is the most boring of all american history events. And this is of all the crap that is american history. Because they are just so boring. OMG they are traveling west, wow, do I give a ****. Plus just because your american and the story is american doesn't make it great you mother*******. **** you. Hope the book rots in hell.
0	A book for the completist: I am just reading the Hornblower series for the first time and reading them in the publishers order. Hornblower During The Crisis is an unfinished book, seriously unfinished, the main story only runs129 pages and would have been wonderful if he had finished the novel (the author passed away). Bundled with 2 other very short stories this book really isn't worth the price.
1	Time filler: This book, the Cry of the Humble, is written with a purpose. It wants to be a compilation of different and short subjects. Who has time to read 600 page books and, besides the other daily rememberances, to be able to recall what you have read yesterday? This book treats most every situation one can meet in life in short recall. Put the book in your grip, read a couple pages while waiting for the bus or any other occasion.
1	correction to a previous review: The word "robot" comes from the Czech word "robota," which in English means "corvee," the obliged labor or servitude that vassals (such as serfs or peasants) had to perform on the lords' estates.
0	Disappointed: Having just read Vanishing Florida by David T. Warner, I was anticipating another look into a native's perspective of old Florida. While Warner's book was engaging, enlightening and entertaining, this one was not. It was mostly a dry historical perspective of the author's family which wasn't that interesting.
0	The author must be an extremely annoying snob.: For a history book, the research and footnotes were not very substantial. Historians have been getting a lot of negative publicity lately for less that exemplary scholarhip. Since this is not a very important book it will not be scrutinized the way Doris Kerns Goodwin or Joseph J.Ellis would be if they were to write about Florida. I felt like someone was snearing at me throughout the book. It seemed more like a big long blog. I'd love to read more about Florida history since so many friends live there now, but I truly hated this book.
1	Life vest: This is a good quality life vest. I am pleased with the fit and feel. I wear it faithfully on our boat!
1	A mob classic!: This is a great movie! If you are into mob movies, this is a must-have. It is a classic and the cast of actors is incredible.
1	great!!: I have never seen this movie, and a friend kept talking about it.....what a great story! And the cast is superb!
0	COPY: This is just a copy of the movie. It is not an original. The DVD was burned on a DVD-R. The labels are nice but the DVD does not contain any menu features at all.
1	good: this is the best a+ book i have been reading easy to understand and brilliant video plenty of studying about core hardware i wish there was more of it especially about windows.good questions and answers programme pity it stops before you you even reach halfway.thank youpraful
1	No Knowledge to success: I could play games and do word processing. If I had a problem I would reload my computer and start over. I'm retired with such outdated skills and physical disabilities that I was unemployable. Started school at NACC in Burbank,California went to class for ten weeks on weekends, read their texts and then bought A+ Certification before testing. I read it through twice, took both CompTIA core and dos adaptive exams the same morning and passed very comfortably.Without this book to put it together from start to finish I would have had to study longer and harder.My only suggestion is in making the Operating System Architecture section more simplified like it is in A+ Dos/Windows second edition Chapter 3 by David Groth.
1	Wow, finally.: I have been looking for a book like this. Trust me. Just follow the book through from cover to cover and take notes for things he emphasizes and then do the practice questions in the book and on the cd. You will pass the exam! Make sure you have a computer to screw around with as well. His tips can be tested and it will help steer you out of confusing questions on the exam because you know which scenarios will not work. I just wrote the core hardware and scored a 913 and i expect to do the same for the operating systems exam next week. (...) remember Comptia's tests are adaptive and you only have thirty minutes. with his book i was done in eleven minutes. Way to go Mikey. Keep up the good work. Every computer technician should have a copy!
1	A+ review: This is a plain language, very detailed book that I would recomend for some one who knows nothing about computers. The hardware section goes into all the detail you need to know for the A+ and then some. All the while it is easy to understand even if you are veging. The software section goes into what you will need to know as well, but you will need to pay a little more attention to what he is writing about if you want to pass. I get the impression this guy really knows what he is talking about. A lot of illustrations.
1	The best book for A+: I passed the A+ Core 84% and I am going for the DOS/Win this week. This book is very good! Very detail compare with other A+ book.
1	Great!: Great quality for the price and does everything i need it to do, it is very large, like the size of a clothing iron about.
0	Not worth the $$$$: We love the idea of this table but found several main problems:1) Cheaply made-- the legs on aon put his foot through the hole in one of the benches while standing on it, which is very dangerous and if my husband hadn't been there to catch him, he would have fallen over with his foot still stuck in the bench3) Stains easily--even crayon marks don't wipe off easily from the surface of this table and marker stains are permanentAll in all, not happy with this product particularly for the price
0	Bradbury Something Wicked This Way Comes: Surprised at what a dud this story felt like, after my other experiences with Bradbury...there is a movie version, and that is equally awful. Not at all what I was expecting.
1	One of his best: How can you go wrong with a Ray Bradbury story....I sent this to my17 year old grandson as an introduction to other fiction.
0	It's OKAY: There's a lot of hype about this being classic literature, and one of the best genre books ever. I disagree. Although Ray Bradbury is a superb writer, this book seems to fall short. The writing is overly poetic, and the dialogue is clunky. If you read this you may find yourself re-reading sentences to figure out what the hell was being said. Although not from the book, there are many, too many, sentences like this:"Will ran, didn't run. Jumped, didn't jump. He stomped his feet on elephant shadows and cat whisker winds."Again, this isn't an actual sentence from the book, but something similar to the type of writing.Buy it, read it, experience it. These reveiws are just a matter of taste anyway. The book simply left me
0	Something Wicked This Way Comes: Ray Bradbury's Something Wicked This Way Comes is a tour de force in the over-use of metaphor and simile to the point that the reader must strain to follow the actual plot without being led repeatedly astray. The author also misuses words intentionally, for effect it seems, but to no discernible advantage. However, there is genius in the creative imagination that went into the plot - no doubt grist for a successful movie - where of course the metaphors and similes fade away as the screen writers and director are forced to visually develop the plot for the viewers. In toto, an very unenjoyably read.
1	Loved it!: Something Wicked This Way Comes was a very interesting read for me. I don't think I've ever read a book quite like this before (this is my first Bradbury novel).The novel itself it beautifully written--at times, almost magical. Bradbury's prose is more along the lines of poetry at many points. This is a positive and also a negative. On the positive side, I think it adds an eeriness to the story. On the negative side, if you aren't used to reading this style of storytelling, it could very well hinder the story and cause disinterest. At first, I was put off by the poetic style. However, the more I read the more I began to enjoy it.I love the "evil carnival comes to town" theme. I liked the main characters, two kids named Will and Jim. I loved the relationship Will has with his father.As much as I liked this book, I couldn't give it 5 stars. I thought the ending was a bit, well, cheesy (for lack of a better word). But, even with that it was a really good novel and I enjoyed it tremendously.
0	Not For Me...: So I don't really understand why this is considered a horror novel? I feel that it was made for children and Bradbury's writing style is a little confusing at times and kind of bland. I thought of it as more of an adventure story then anything. If you want something that is scary then this is not for you. I am a huge horror book nut but this book just didn't do it for me at all.
1	Best Book Ever: This may be the best book ever written by a human being. Next to the Bible and Shakespeare, there are few better books. This is one of the first books I ever read on the chronic pain problems around the world, and how to get over them. Her work with people suffering from chronic pain is an inspiration to writers everywhere. The stories of people being misdiagnosed as "simply depressed" was insightful. It is a clear, and easy to read book. Yet it has many detailed facts, and interviews. I was suffering from chronic pain greatly when I read this, and her chapters on herbal vitamins to take helped me greatly! I was very moody before, and this helped without drugs! Her tips on how to write about your pain to help get outside your pain very insightful. I loved this book, and I think it is a great work for anyone dealing with chronic pain.
1	Great book!: I think this is a great book for anyone who might suspect they have endo or was just diagnosed with it. It was a great read lots of info!
1	Emily Richrds needs a recording contract!: I just love her music, especially "Lie To Me". She captures the passion and essence of love and life. It's like listening to the energy people give off. I wish more people could experience her trur talent. Good Driving Stuff!
1	Specialized area of interest - excellent book: Got it as a gift for one who loves this writer. He enjoyed it very much.
1	Thumbs up!: C-balance is an excellent product from a trusted hobbyist turned vendor Julian Sprung, this is also the best price available anywhere.
0	Too Bulky!: When I put this on my car visor, it was visually distracting and made me feel claustrophobic! Having 30 CDs hanging over my head is just not a good idea. I tried to give it to my husband, but he thought the same thing, and got a smaller one that holds10 CDs. Much better.
0	Terrible book: Considering that this book is the10th edition, I would not want to see what the previous editions looked like. This book is full of mistakes, both editorial and technical.Don't buy this book unless you absolutely have to for a class. If you do have to, look for the best price on a used book, don't bother to buy a new one, you will NOT want to keep it.This book has some of the worst examples I have ever seen. The examples are so convoluted that there usually isn't a straight forward answer to most of the problems. This has been verified by looking in the instructors version of the book.
0	Not polished or put together very well: I had to buy this book for a Masters degree course. I think a fair amount of data is contained within the text but the organization style is not that good. The author drops hints that he has been writing this book for a long time and that it has helped some major names in the database world find inspiration... that's all well and good but a good book does this not make.The price is obviously way too much for something that is not really a practical guide. Most of the people that buy it will likely only be buying it because they are forced to. What a shame...it would be much nicer to have a quality product to learn from. This is not it in my opinion. It could be done better.
1	Nice item for what it does: I'd used this adapter with my Canon SX30IS to place polaraized, coloraized and neutral filter of 58mm, 'cause I like big filters better. I'd to zoom a little to get rid of the black corner, but is perfect after that.
0	Predictable, simplistic and boring: I found this book to be so predictable, the story line was too simple...there was no depth to the story or to the characters....and I had a hard time sticking with it. The whole story focuses on this woman's issues with her own father that she then transfers to the father of her student. How do they fall in love? I haven't a clue because there was absolutely no story there to give that scenario any meat or background. I'm just saying.....I see the author has other books...I hope they are better for the sake of those who buy them.
1	a very delicate writing: A curiosity of between a fiction and a true story makes me read this book. I really like "the Lover", it's one of my favorite book to recommand others, even though I don't like much Duras.The writing is so short, like pieces of puzzle, there is no order to explain. Duras wrote what she felt, thought spontaneously in a paragragh after another. This book is descriptive and the flow of feelings is so delicate. Especially, the reflections about the life that Duras explained in this story, are truly profound and even sorrowful for me.There is no tension, no exposed conflict, the story moves so still like the calm ocean. The tranquility in rich thoughtful description, that's why I like this novel.
0	hard to follow: I don't care for the author's abuse of the time line. Duras' character development is firm, but her flashbacks are ill timed and confusing. Duras' message of using the women's body as a form of control and yet making the main character seem separated from her body doesn't seem to really say anything.
0	One dominant flavor that didn't work for me personally: I would not buy this particular Yogi Tea again because I hate the taste of licorice/anise. The flavor of the licorice and fennel seed is very dominant, making it a sort of sickly sweet flavor which wasn't what I was hoping for with my burning throat. I think a better blend would be something with more "heat" like ginger, which is why I usually drink Yogi's Cold Season instead, for the same purpose.With a sore throat, its reasonable to suffer through a yucky flavor if it makes a discernible difference but this tea didn't do that.
1	Oh lord!: This is the DEFINITIVE Count Basie + Williams album! IT DOES NOT get any better than this!Of special credit:"Everyday" <--Easily the best arragement--EVER!"Please Send me Someone to Love" <--Ditto.etc etcBUY ITLISTEN TO ITLOVE IT!
1	Blown away!: I had the great pleasure of spending some time with Johnnie Lee and her dear friend Asia about 20 years ago. She told me she was a singer, but I never had the opportunity to hear her perform --- until now!! All I can say is WOW! I'm truly proud of her. This disc is nothing short of sensational. Rock, blues, jazz --- Johnnie Lee has all the bases covered, and with an incredible variety of texture and tone. There is real passion in every song, and some of these melodies had to have been very difficult to master. I'm so happy to have found, quite by accident, this incredible CD. I hope she reads this review, because I was so taken with her way back then that I wrote a character based on her into my novel, coincidentally published around the same time that this CD was issued. The link is below:Confluence: A NovelJohnnie, I hope you are well and happy and prosperous. This disc deserved to be a big hit.

1	What a surprise!!: Sincerely, I didn't expect a surprise like this. I went to the theater expecting to see a typical entertaining film -I see all the Kevin Spacey's-. When I got out I had that taste in my mouth that only leave the really good films.Magnificent interpretations, a solid script, a good direction and -in occasions- a splendid BGM is all you'll encounter in this film. I won't miss it.Or, at least, that's my opinion...
0	K Pax: Two-thirds of the way through K-PAX I decided that only a great ending was going to redeem this movie. Unfortunately, it ended with a skittering thud and had me muttering "What the huh?" Kevin Spacey and Jeff Bridges are good enough to make their scenes together interesting, but the story is pretty confused. A rental at best.
0	K-KRAP: On the one hand, you've got the nuthouse dramas where the mental patient provides deep truths to inmates and staff alike (Don Juan DeMarco; Cuckoo's Nest). On the other hand, you've got the Taoist alien dispensing generic new-age advice (Starman). Trying to mix the two was a BIG mistake. This movie was way too long, way too slow, too self-involved and overall just dull. Kevin Spacey has done some fantastic work (Seven; American Beauty; Usual Suspects) but this is isn't it. Also, someone said the ending was ambiguous. Not true. Prot is Robert Porter.
1	Since high school...: I have had Dickies pants/shorts on and off since high school. I used to skateboard much more than I do now, and find that these are quite durable. The regular 874 pants have the best fit out of all the other selections available. The only thing I don't like is they attract lint a little too much.
1	Great Value: Pants are comfortable Wash and wear well. I am a truck driver and I get very dirty and a lot of things to get caught on. These pant are performing well .
1	Comfort Fit Here.: I bought these Dickies work pants , we used to call them "chinos" in the1950s,don't ask me why.Ok so they are comfortable and light to wear not heavy canvas pants which is what "bluejeans" really. You walk around in heavy canvas pants or dungarees and wonder why your legs get tired so easy! DA! Anyway I woke up and now I will wear light workpants like Dickies and relax. I do recommend these to anyone .
1	The First Iron lady?: This is an excellent book and a lively and interesting read. Anne Somerset gives an insight into all sides of the character of Elizabeth. Her moods and feelings, (she was renowned at the time for her short temper), both as a woman and a Queen.The glamour of the Tudor court and what it was like to be in or out of favour in a clique where a careless word could in some cases cost you your life.Elizabeth did not suffer fools gladly and the book examines her religious feelings, her sexuality and the way she dealt with conflicts both at home and abroad in what was essentially a man's world. Elizabeth was nobody's fool and although she would listen to her advisers, she had a mind of her own, shrewd and extremely intelligent, and was quite capable of using her authority as monarch to make important decisions for herself.The book is a delight for anyone with the slightest interest in history.
0	Poor: No good... as bad as the Curse of the Pink Panther..... unwatchable!Frankly there is only one Peter Sellers and no doubles can compare just as there is only one Herbert Lom without whom there is no Pink Panther either! If you are a fan get the S.Martin remake, it is rather good and Dryfus is well defined. But do SKIP this one!
1	yeah: french rap at its best! i love it, great beats, excellent lyrics, dope features, every euro worth ;-))
0	Quit with the ads on the clips already!: WANTED to watch the behind the scenes Jailhouse Rock clip but unfortunately Amazon feels the need to ruin it by peddling Elvis product with the damn pop ups thru the whole thing. Maybe if I could actually enjoy the clip I might buy the dvd. Just because of the annoyance factor I am not. You suck Amazon
0	Speedway: Okay here is my opinion. One of my favorite actors in the whole universe is Bill Bixby. If Bill had not been in this movie, I would've gave it1 star. I have respect for Elvis as a singer but he could not act worth a lick! This is another typical Elvis movie, that you just sit through it and by the end of it you think to yourself that you have spent 50 years watching this movie. I think that what makes me like it a bit is because of Bill Bixby being in it.Jenny
0	Hurts my teeth: These were way too strong for my teeth. I used them as directed and towards the end less than directed. They gave me long term pain in my teeth(about a years worth).
1	Crest Whitestrips: Excellent product.. More comments on whiter teeth and nicer smile than i've ever had in my life ! Most everyone noticed w/out even a prompted question to them.
1	amazing product: years ago when the original whitestrips first came out, i tried them. i had great results and the whitening actually lasted longer than i had expected. fastforward a handful of years and i have decided to try the premium strips. i'm getting braces in a month, and i wanted quick results that would last at least through a portion of my treatment. i used the premium strips for 30mins lastnight and i had amazing results from only one strip! if my teeth keep whitening like this, i will have to stop using them before the box is done to prevent having the unnatural 'hollywood glow'. i was blown away!
0	These do NOT work...I promise!: These do NOT whiten teeth. I've tried them and the commercials are deceiving. You will NOT get the results they show on the commercials. I was very disappointed in this product.Save the money from these and go to the dentist and have a professional zoom whitening. There is no way you are going to whiten your teeth at home using these. The peroxide isn't strong enough. The dentist uses over twice the strength of these. I don't care how many packages of these you use, it will not work.Also...The bottom strips are too small to cover your teeth and they float off in your saliva. You're basically ingesting peroxide from them. I don't know how safe that could be, but it's not very promising to me. The dentist will cost more, but it will be what you are really expecting. Save your money.
0	Formatting makes this book hard to read: I was excited to read this free book until I received it.Unfortunately there is no table of contents.Some of the punctuation is different from the original. This is distracting and slows the pace of the book.Everything runs together. The entire book from the preface to the end reads like one chapter without a break.
1	Now I know why it is such a favorite.: I was an English Lit. major, and never a big fan of Dickens. He is too long winded. But this book seemed too short. It's not that I felt that it was incomplete. I just enjoyed it so much that I wanted more.Do yourself a favor, and read it at christmas time. I did.
0	Wasnt what I expected: My family has a history of Dyslexia, so comic books are hard to read. So when my mother told me that had a Christmas Carol, Batman classic for sale, I was thrilled. Needless to say, there was no Batman and I wasted my time and money wondering when we were going to see the caped crusader kicking ebeneezers arse.
1	Short & To The Point !: Dover Thrift Editions of Charles Dickens Christmas Classic, "A Christmas Carol" is short and to the point. My kind of book. The world over knows the premise of Dickens classic but (especially) at this time of year is a story most people will enjoy reading again. The slim 68 pages makes it possible to share this story with a love one in less than an hour. Puts even the most hateful love one in the holiday spirit.
0	Poorly done e-book: Beware, this edition contains all sorts of unmappable punctuation, resulting in irritating replacement characters appearing in place of every apostrophe.
0	maybe good but definitely NOT the unabridged recording: once again, (OK it does not happen that often, otherwise we would stop trusting Amazon and shopping with them, would'nt we?) the description is not accurate : this version ISBN1569945233, monterey media etc.... is an ADAPTATION of Dicken's novel by the St Charles PLayers, who record it with all due talent and spirit BUT as a play, in an "exciting Radio Theater style" quote, unquote.....
0	A Choppily Abridged Carol: Although the artwork in this book is great, readers should be warned that the text is a heavy-handed abridgement of Charles Dickens's wonderful little novel. It omits far too much of the rich and colorful language of this stirring novelette.
1	Couldn&#65533;t put it down: I think this book should be made compulsory reading in schools. It is defiantly one of the great classics. It is timeless, it is still as good today as the day it was first released. I have read few books that would match up to this one. This book can be read by all ages and by people in all warps off life and can be enjoyed by all. I would recommend this book to any one and hope that all have the satisfaction of reading it.
1	Loving a Christmas Carol: This audio version of A Christmas Carol was great. The narrator's voice(s) were very interesting. It matched right along with the version of the book I used for my English class. We enjoyed the story and enjoyed the narrator's classic telling of this classic story.
1	It was a good book and a short book too: It was a good book I finished it in 3 days it was very very very short and I loved the movie
1	A dickens of a story: I had seen various movie versions, and knew the story well. However it was fun just to read Dickens original .
1	Excellent classic: It was great to read this classic once again. Read it years ago and forgot how great especially around the holidays
1	Great classic: Very well developed characters and fabulous description make Mr. Dickens such a great writer. Well worth the time on a cold winter night.
1	Vocabulary: The only thin I had trouble with us the language and vocabulary. Other than that it's a very good Christmas story
1	well written: yes, you already know the story. if you have ever seen any of the infinite number of movies made about this story any time in the last112 years you all ready know what happens. so, why read the book? why? because it is written humorously and beautifully. the characters are written so well that you can relate to all of them and feel acutely what ever the writer wants you to feel toward them. it is also one of Dicken's shorter reads.
1	Great edition of A Christmas Carol: Love Robert Ingpen's illustrations - they work so well for this story in particular. As far as I can tell, this is not abridged either which is a huge plus. If you want an edition of A Christmas Carol on your shelf, this is definitely a good one.
1	The book showed true family values.: I liked Charles Dickens, The Christmas Carol, because it had lots of class. Dickens wrote about something and now you read it to your grandchildren on Christmas Eve. It's something that the whole family will enjoy. I know my family does.
1	Holiday classic: This is a good lesson learned book and brings to mind in reading the importance of sharing with joy. All should learn from this book s message.
1	a holiday classic: A good read for the Christmas holidays. A little wordy at times though but that's expected with the period it was written in. It definitely gives you a glimpse into19th century London and how tough life was.
1	Always a good read!: As fun to read as to watch! While not the true Christmas story, it certainly captures the spirit of Christmas and the effects of living one's Christmas faith in the incarnate Lord Jesus.
1	Not as great as the other seasons. Still missing Dana... it was great seeing her "ghost" in one episode!: I find that the 4th season was not as good as the previous ones. I love all the characters but I did not like Shane moving on so quickly with Paige. She seem to be more the person that Carmen wanted but without Carmen.
0	TOTAL WASTE OF TIME: IT'S NOT OFTEN THAT I DIAMETRICALLY OPPOSE ANOTHER PERSON'S OPINION BUT I THOUGHT THIS BOOK WAS TERRIBLE. I READ ABOUT100 PAGES AND TOSSED IT. THE WRITING IS VERY STILTED AND ITS JUST NOT A COMFORTABLE READ. HEROINE AGGIE IS SO FULL OF START THAT SHE'S JUST NO LIKEABLE, EVEN IN THE LOVE SCENES.....
0	Worst -- Macbeth -- Ever!: First, you can watch this train wreck for free through Google video.Second, find it and watch the ending just so you see Brett's ridiculous Macbeth costume. His tights look like cheap, ill-fitting long underwear with the crotch almost down to his knees. This is during the final scenes where he spits death in the eye, so it's pretty hysterical. With the fakey swords being waved around it brings to mind children horsing around in the backyard.
0	Too much 'Method' in this madness: Method actress Piper Laurie made me laugh out loud when she began the "Come you spirits" speech as if she were trying to summon Blanche DuBois and Medea in one go. Can't imagine Mr. Brett's excuse for as abysmally poor acting. For even worse Shakespearean acting (and yes, it's not the same as playing any other texts) see two Star Trekkers (Ohura and the Russian guy) and a General Hospital star (Luke) in this series' "Antony and Cleopatra". Not a larfing matter in the end.
1	Book - A Sailors' Valentine by John Fondas - great purchase!: I was thrilled to finally receive my book The Sailors' Valentine. It's a unique book about an old art using shells. The sailors of a century and more ago created the Valentines for their sweethearts. The pictures are fantastic and the octagon shape of the book makes it a perfect table book. I could not find this out-of-print book anywhere but on Amazon.com. I received it in it's original sealed box: it was new listed in the used book section. Thanks, Amazon!
0	One star may be too much. Hack writing at its laziest.: Seriously, I cannot fathom that people gush over this book.Essentially, what IDENTITY CRISIS was supposed to be was a 'whodunnit' for the DC Universe stable of characters. However, in a world of telepaths, sorcerers and men who shoot laser beams out of their eyes it falls embarrassingly flat on its face. Meltzer composes a story full of plot holes, bad characterization, and enough tired cliches to make any true fan of the genre wince.Quite possibly the only good comment I could make is that the artist is quite talented... other than that, not a lot to recommend.
1	Replacement blades at a reasonable price: These replacement blades worked great when I needed to repair my AlienFly after flying it into the wall too many times!
1	Good read and easy to understand: This book doesn't contain mathematical formula which is a plus for me!The explanation on how a statistic can be misunderstood or misrepresent in simple English.It is helpful because I can spot more loopholes in statistics now.On the other hand, if a need arises. I can use these methods to mislead people!
0	Tiesto your mix and track selection is bad !!!: I seriously don't think this cd deserves the avg rating it has got. This has got to be the "worst" in search of sunrise series by the `so called #1 dj' Tiesto...The very first song when crossfading with the second is patchy ...which means he cant get the basics right of beat matching. He could have at least perfected it in the studio before the release. (Im sure everyone who bought the cd agrees). Also there is no proper direction in the music. The tunes are not catchy...they are really boring...and sounds like someone is learning to play the keyboard (except Coca & Villa - La Noche), even the vocal tunes here are horrible.Tiesto has lost my vote for the top dj poll (paul van dyk was always #1 for me and will always be)I regret buying this CD. And am depressed with the current state of trance music. Only Paul Van Dyk can cure me with his Politics of Dancing 2 CD.
1	It's first European trip was a success!Q: We bought this product as a gift for our friends to assist them in their 40th anniversary trip to Europe. In their return, one of the first things they said was "how practical and how useful" their GPS was in Europe, especially in England.Apparently, at practicality and ease of use departments it beat the in-dash product that came with their luxury automobile.Sounds like we picked the right product for the right purpose...
0	Beware of cost of updates - opnly one free update offered: I purhcased the nuvi 670 from Amazon several weeks ago and I was hapy with the unit until I checked to see if there were map updates avaialable from Garmin. Garmin's website stated that map updates were available for Europe and North America, but only one update was free. So I spent all this money on a International GPS unit only to end up with one map being out of date. When I received the unit it had a 2006 maps for Europe and 2008 maps fo North America. There were updated versions of both maps available, but I would have to pay for one of them - the cheap one costing close to $70USD. I contacted Garmin on several different occasions and they stood by their policy of only offering one free map update. What a disappointment with this supposively good company. You buy a GPS and it doesn't even come with the latest maps. I am very disappointed.Ron
1	A Lot for the Money: Since the 670 is a discontinued model the price reduction on Amazon was tremendous. For less than $320 you get the following features- Spoken street names (although they often indistinguishable via computerized voices)- Bluetooth cell phone reception (with a bluetooth phone which works very well)- FM traffic monitor (of limited usefulness)- US/Canada & European maps (relative up to date; for the latest maps you get one updated map free and the other must be purchased)- Car & a separate home recharger- Front Window mount- Close to 6 million POI's- Car/Truck/Motorcylce/Walking modes- One way point before end destination- Old style flip antenna (instead of built in)- Very bright screen- Speaker could be louder-I took the unit on a recent trip and it was at least 90% accurate with recent (within the year) roads and freeways often not given. Highly recommended.
1	Garmin nuvi 670 review: I've had a Garmin Quest for many years and have used it throughout the U.S. and Europe on many trips. I bought the Nuvi 670 for my other cars. It has improved antenna sensitivity to work better in a city environment, pre-loaded U.S. and European maps, clearer and enhanced voice instructions as well as blue tooth and other features make this a really enjoyable and useful product.
1	You can never go wrong with Bugs and Company: Having grown up with Bugs Bunny I am pleased to see they are still going. My son laughs out loud when we watch it.
1	Excellent Book for Practice!: When I purchased this book, I hoped that it would help me improve my SAT score. It has helped my improve my score, but lacked some of the tricks that I had expected to find in it. This book offers a great amount of practice problems and excellent explanations, but it gives very little information about some of the test taking tips that other books give. So, if you're looking for a book that gives you a lot of practice with verbal problems, this books is excellent. However, if you hope to find tricks of the trade in this book, look somewhere else because this book gives very minimal.
1	Clear Structure, Good Vocab List: The vocabulary list contained in this book goes on for 90 pages, and contains about 2500 words. Since last month, I have taken the challenge to memorize them all. Everyday, I also took one of the 30 or so question sets (10 analogy,10 fill-in,10 reading). By now, I am 2/3 of the way finished. This contributed greatly to the increase of my verbal score to 750 (from 650) on the practice SAT test.Besides, I also have "hot words for SAT1", and the Barron's guide. This is because one book does not offer enough practices. Getting a couple books is also advantagous because the varying teaching styles makes the task of memorization less monotonous.
0	Skip it!: I bought this for my daughter to try. Her hair is thin and about 2" past her shoulders. while using our regualr shampoo & conditioner, her hair was easily mangeable and looked and felt healthy.AFter using Mane n' tail, her hair felt thicker, dry, and tangled very easily. Working with her hair after using this shampoo was hard. I took her into the barber shop for a trim & the beautician commented on how dry her hair was. It was not dry before using this shampoo.Skip it! It's not worth damaging your hair. We'll stick to what's been working for us.
0	A terrible destruction of beautiful music by a great compose: Being that I was born in a latin american country, listening to these tunes (original versions)I can safely say that Mr. Veloso's representation of them are the weakest that I have ever had the mispleasure of listening, and I am a great admirer of Mr. Veloso's works in his native "portuguese" .
0	repetitive repetitive repetitive repetitive: how many times can you say the same thing??just ask Gordon before you waste your money on this.
0	New battery behaves like used one: I bought a new battery but it is behaving like a used battery. The battery live does not last more than 2 days when not in use.
0	Not OEM product: Given the variance in reviews, at best, I'd say this is an unreliable product. (I saw the mixed reviews before ordering, but figured "they couldn't be that bad.")First of all, the battery was NOT a BB battery -- not as pictured nor made in Japan (it was plain silver and made in China).The battery I received wouldn't hold a charge for more than a couple of hours. I sent an e-mail complaint; was told that sometimes a given battery won't be up to snuff; and they would exchange. The second battery lasted a little longer but not even 24 hours. I gave up. I had made a bad bet. I just didn't want to bother with them any more. I used it for a couple of months -- having to charge it once or twice a day. It declined steadily and finally flat-lined this week. Ironically, I'm now using my old battery which seems brilliant compared to my recent experiences.Maybe you'll get lucky, but the odds are against you.
0	8830 Battery: I did not do a scientific study, but I don't think the new battery that I received holds more or longer charge than my worn out 31/2 year old battery. When I got the battery it looked a bit beat. I called and they assured me that it is new. The person said that the batteries ship bulk in a bag and they get beat up. I'm not thrilled with the performance. I am skeptical and will not do it again. Cannot recommend it.
0	rating the actual book, not its wonderful content: This huge, collector's edition is HEAVY, the font is small, and there is a ridiculous amount of margin area for writing. I take copious notes, but this is even too much for me. So in effect, you buy this supposedly beautifuly collector's edition, but it's shiny paper back - what's so great about it? Nothing. I'm not even sure why it costs so much. I've seen numerous errors in spelling. The value doesn't equal what you pay for it. Go for the lighter editions, unless, like other reviewers, you buy this merely to sit on your shelf to impress people (or yourself).As for the book, Adam Smith is thorough, it's hard work to get through it, but his principles are sound and when left to work without government regulation, the precepts taught therein work beautifully. Smith gets five stars. The Premium Edition is lucky to get two.
0	Bad Edition: I would not buy this edition. The printing is terribly small. Its about half the size of normal print. And there is no introduction. Usually these types of works have some sort of preface which introduces the reader to the material.
0	Beware: NO 5th BOOK!: The Everyman's Library version is abridged -- without being advertised as so, either on Amazon OR anywhere inside the book!The Wealth of Nations is a pivotal work in the history of economics and human nature, but you'd be better off finding an edition that includes the entire work.The Wealth of Nations (Everyman's Library)
1	Essential Reading: This is in my top 5 best books of all time. I give it an A+. It is a very long read that covers a broad range of information involving economics, but well worth the time spent. There are a lot of references to issues that were occurring during Smith's time that may not seem to be pertinent to the reader, but can still be applied to modern times. I most enjoyed the last sections of the book on taxes and public debts. His 4 maxims of taxes are that they should be- equal, certain, convenient, and beneficial. He viewed inflation as "extremely pernicious". The book contains ideas that Americans should possibly revisit in the near future.
0	Smokey and the Bandit Pursuit Pack: The quality of this 3 movie DVD was terrible. The first movie froze up near the end even after I attempted to play it in a second player. The 2nd movie didn't play at all and the third one, which played perfectly, was a waste of time.The original Smokey and the Bandit was true comedy genius and Jackie Gleason's portrayal of Sheriff Buford T. Justice was one of his very best. Burt Reynolds, Sally Field and Jerry Reed were dynamite together and Jerry Reed's "East Bound and Down" song topped a great comedy. Its too bad the 2nd movie didn't play, because I thought this one was nearly as good as the first. The 3rd installment lacked good writing and seemed just plain empty without Burt Reynolds and Sally Field.Smokey and the Bandit: Pursuit Pack
1	Burt Reynolds: It came very fast and the quality is very good, would buy from this seller again if they anything that I want. Thanks
0	Diehard fans wondering about the B-side???: Well, if you missed this import single when it was released along with a handful more, you may fear you missed an Andy Bell gem. This track is a B-side for a reason. Totally inferior to anything on the full length CD. No, it's not an electro house dance track like much of what you'll find on the full length. It's a short, sort of campy cabaret style track that uses what sounds like a real band, including acoustic drums, guitar, and even a horn section. If you simply MUST have everything Andy Bell sings, then you do get plenty of his vocal, but if you're really more just about his classic dance sound, then pass on it. Ashame they couldn't have just thrown it in as a bonus track on the domestic maxi-single release of Crazy.
0	Incorrect advertisement: You have an advertisement to use the Olympus B-50SU 4 AA NiMH Batteries and charger with the DSC-U10 camera. The DSC-U10 camera uses AAA batteries not AA. Do you have a AAA NiMH battery and charger for the DSC-U10 camera ??? I guess I can use the B-50SU charger for other things that need AA batteries. Please correct your advertisement.
1	Old School Action Movie: I agree with the other reviewers that this is an entertaining action movie as long as your suspend MOST of your belief in reality. I do what to point out that the machine gun he shoots is a Browning .30 caliber NOT a .50 caliber. The gun was meant to shot from a tripod, but it COULD be shot from the hip. He DOES run out of bullets for it and his handguns. As for the rocket launcher part...I'm sorry, the explosion/back blast would have killed all three of them in the room when it went off!
1	Death-wish-3: This is the best death-wish in this one bronson goes head-to-head with a gang that took over a 6 block radious of new york bronsons gun is very cool the ending is great and the music is cool cheak it out.

1	Super grass seed!: My sister who lives close by used this Canada Green grass seed and her lawn is fabulous! I fear I"m more exhuberance than skill and it didn't do well in my yard. I"m will to give it another try! Be informed that there's a LOT of rye in it which means in warm weather it won't do well.

1	The masterpiece of American song: Perhaps the best thing to say about this Songbook is what Ira Gershwin said after hearing it. " I did not realize how good our songs( George and Ira Gershwin) were until I heard Ella sing them. In these Songbooks she is at her mature best. Her voice is smooth, elegant, clear , beautifully nuanced, rich in range, remarkable. It is sheer joy to listen to her in the very best of the songs. While many prefer the drive and rhythm of Ellington I myself prefer the more lyrical and slower swinging pieces. But what is important is that this is a great Masterpiece which presents the great works of the American Songook in the best way possible.One can listen to these songs again and again , and doing so brings only greater pleasure.
1	Where struggle ends and grace begins: I first read this book when I had to write an existential paper for one of my counseling classes. It was difficult for me to understand at first, but I read it again, and it changed my life in ways. So many times, we look at God and box him/her into compartments. When we do this, we think we have a good handle on who and what God is. Then as time goes on, and we evolve, our thoughts on God no longer relate or apply to our lives. Through the struggle to know, seek and experience God, we many times are disappointed when God and ourselves do not connect. Paul Tillich tells us that through the struggle, we must have absolute faith, and the god who is really God appears in Grace.
0	Piece of Crap: I bought this radio because my last one that I bought in 6 dollars from walmart was broken from its antena and now it could play channels but there was static most of the time. I was too excited about new radio . I got my radio yesterday and it was biggest disapointment for me. This radio had more static than the broken one I had. none of SW cannel is working they are there just for show. None of these channels is clear enough that you can understand something. I will suggest either get some radio that can only work with AM/FM but have clear sound or spend more money and get something that works
0	Leather Flip Cover: The plastic mounting device that secures the leather flip cover to the M5 is very poorly engineered. I purchased my M5 in January and this mounting device has already broken. I am seriously considering replacing it with some other protective device.

1	It doesn't really do it: This work has much interesting information but I do not think it truly defines the 'Jewish Mind'. I have the sense that the Jewish Mind if we consider its creations from Biblical Time to now is simply too vast and varied for easy definition. I would too say that as Jews value the idea of Creation , their own Mind is in a constant process of Development and creation. Any summary then seems to be a simple reduction, and not true to the Reality.
0	Details, Details, Details!!: I did not care for this book at all. It was all detail and description. The excitement of the book isn't until the very end and even that wasn't so great. The only part of the book I enjoyed was the subtle way that Marian had feelings for Shane because she was so fascinated by him. Otherwise I couldn't wait until it was over so I could write my paper and get it over with.
1	This book has potential: Ok, I am kind of stuck. I am trying to find the real meaning of "Shane", but with no avail. I KNOW there is a meaning, all the adults talk about it...but what is it? And, what are all the 'little' meanings (ex. What is the meaning of the stump? Does it show that Joe and Shane work well together?) PLEASE help me! email me or something. I am in 8th Grade and I just got done with the book. help.
1	A Decent, Well-Acted, 45-Minute Movie: I had seen this movie on TV way back in1991 on a local PBS station. I hadn't seen it since then. So when I got this DVD recently, I was really looking forward to seeing it again. I remembered how well-acted this movie was.It is a very good movie. However, I noticed that some of the dialogue seemed a little "forced" in certain parts. You could tell that the actors were "reading" scripted lines. This only happened in a couple places. Other than that, all the other dialogue was rendered in a natural and effective way.This movie is quite sad, and the actors really bring that across. You can sense their pain and hurt as they work through the anguish of Andre's death.This is a very good movie (and very short). Well worth the investment!
1	Good fun, though not the strongest in the series: More good fun from Chester Himes. On the plus side, he finally includes some entertaining sex. On the other hand, one of the main bad guys here (the "Colonel") is particularly flat and unbelievable. Also, as usual, the end is much less satisfying than the ride to get there.
1	Attractive and expensive looking, but great price.: I was very please with how well made these rings are. They were very cheap compared to everything else out there, so I was prepared for shoddy quality, but that's not what came. They are really well finished.
1	Good value, unique ... but watch your measurements.: I ordered this item hopeful that it would fit my rods. However, as others have mentioned, the dimensions are not truly 2" ... likely best for a1" rod. Anything over that just doesn't work.Regrettably, this item was returned.
1	good for the price: I bought this so my son could have a pocket to stash his car stuff in. So far so good. The price was good.
0	can't see it: i have an ipad and a local wifi. i couldn't see the movie as a cloud. i downloaded but each time i tried to see it i received the same message: htttp....... so the movie remains on my ipad unviewed. I would give it a higher rating if i could at least see it.
1	Great live CD: As one other reviewer mentioned finding great live CD's from new wave bands is very difficult. I'm usually not a fan of live CD's but I really enjoy this one. Autumnal Park is one of my all-time favorite new wave albums and I am excited that I get to continue to listen to it live.
0	very disappointed: emailed this company to find out if this was an "antique" book, but received absolutely no response except that the book arrived and it's new; very disappointed and dont recommend doing business w/them
0	not worth the money: After reading the editors note on this book one is lead to believe that this book will give you information on19-century photography. You are lead to believe that a wealth of information is on hand, but it is note. In fact very little is shown concerning photography, and almost nothing at all concerning the cameras. In short this book is trash, and not worth the money, or the paper it is printed on!
0	Relaxing Music?: I was hoping to find some nice calming, relaxing music to play in my classroom and home. This was a little too instrumentally loud.
1	great product: even though it was damaged in shipping this charger works great and i would recomend it to anyone it charges fast and since it has a fan it does not over heat like most chargers
1	Hex Wrenches: I have used this brand previously at work and have had good luck with them. The coating holds up to daily use and abuse.
1	Best film about art and the artist ever: I try to watch this movie once a year. It is a gorgeous, slow moving thing. The better part of the movie is taken up with the battle between Frehofer and the form he is trying to bring to life on the canvas, with Emmanuelle Beart as his model. He gives up... she gives up... but they plow on through. The story is unsullied by any erotic (or at least, overtly erotic) connection between the two. But there is none of the neurotic histrionics and unrequited sacrifices of the usual films about artist: there is just the hard, greuling, work of having a vision and getting it right.This is freely based on the story "The Unknown Masterpiece" by Balzac. If only more movies "freely based" on a story could be as fine as this one. Knowing the story, which is a short novella, may actually add to the appreciation of the film and the character of Frenhofer.
1	Mish: This is a hilarious album with all the favourite aspects of the Prairie Home Companion show. Garrison Keillor could read the phone book and it would be funny.
1	Garrison Keillor . . . need anyone say more?: It's a full hour of A Prairie Home Companion, not just the best bits from various shows. The version of the small church's struggle to find a musical director seems different from the one I have on another CD, but it's all delightful. Great way to spend an hour while driving in the country. WARNING: do not attempt to operate vehicle in town or under complicated road conditions while listening to any PHC CD. These require some brainwork, and I've almost driven off the road laughing a couple of times.
1	All of the books in this series are excellent!: The lessons in the books of this series are classic,timeless and very much needed at this time. I wish every parent would read them to their children.
1	An Old Favorite: I fondly remember this book that I read as a child over fifty years ago. I was looking for a way to address issues about manners with my five year old grandson and rediscovered this book. He clearly got the messages Leaf imparted and thoroughly enjoyed it. The author did an excellent job of succicntly and imaginatively presenting the rules of getting along with others and the consequences of not doing so. The terminology and pictures Leaf used to describe poorly mannered children was indelibly printed in my mind and has lost none of its charm.
0	HELP ME!: Oh my gosh. I f you are looking for an interesting book to read. Don't read Treasure Island. It is totally on a reading level for way older people. Not 7th graders. I had to read this book in class and it was so hard to understand that I gave up and fell asleep. Boring Book. I wouldn't even classify it as a classic. I would classify it as a good way to put yourself to sleep.
1	Stevenson's Best!: This book is the best book i have ever read! i have already read this book 5 times and i will read it much more in my lifetime. Stevenson blends adventure and intrigue splendidly in this fast paced novel about a young boy who receives a treasure map from an old buccaneer, and his adventures afterward. Hawkins, the boy, meets up with salty pirates and finds good friends in the captain and doctor. i would reccomend that anyone who loves a good book and an exciting thrill should definately read this.
1	A treasure: This is an authentic masterpiece by the author of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde, which tells a story of pirates in search of a treasure hidden in an island. Dr Jekyll is very different, a strange, puzzling, mysterious, symbolic story. The characters in Treasure Island are unforgettable, Jim Hawkins, Dr Livesey, captain Smollet, John Silver, the man without a leg who disappears in Latin America and the pirate Flint, a character who is always present, but only through the dialogues. This is a classic, but a cult novel as well.
1	Review of "Treasure Island": Stevenson's "Treasure Island" is remarkably well written, containing fascinating bits of foreshadowing, a unique and captivating plot, and undying characters that will burn into your mind indefinitely.My personal favorite character is Long John Silver, who throughout the novel seems almost schitzofranic. His one side is well-mannered, charming and witty, while his other face is ruthless, sly and money-driven.In Part One, "The Old Buccaneer", the strange new pirate pays Jim Hawkins a gold piece daily "to watch out for a one-legged man hobbling down the street." This is truly good, almost humorous, foreshadowing.The ending is perfectly crafted by Stevenson; it closes with Jim Hawkins describing his predictions for the destinies of the pirates he has traveled with.Thank you, Robert Louis Stevenson, for contributing one of literatures' most amazing works.
1	Treasure Island: I read this year's ago and loved it then. I enjoyed reading it again, wonderful book! This was the first book I read on my kindle, awesome!
1	Treasure Island: I thought that "Treasure Island" was a very good, exciting book and it made me want to read. There were some parts that were not as interesting as others and they needed some excitment and at these parts I didnt think that I was going to like the book, but by the end I didnt want it to be over. I thought it was very exciting how they were on the island with all these pirates and how they were both going after the same thing, the treasue. Adding new characters and taking away some of the old ones,death, was also a part of how it made it interesting. over all it is a very good book and I advise people of all ages to read it
0	Booooooooooorrrrrrrring!!!: I had to read this for a 7th grade class... I got what was happening (mostly), but it was the dumbest story. There was no point and i was about to fall asleep halfway through- Totally boring! Save your time, or if you do get it, DON'T get the old version- the conversations are even harder to understand.
1	First read: Up until this point I had only ever seem Muppet Treasure Island. This book is actually pretty cool, certainly worth reading given that it comes for free with the kindle.
1	Treasure Island: A classic. Everyone should read this book...and all things written by Robert Louis Stevenson. He is one of my favorite authors of all time.
1	treasure island: treasure islandis an awesome book I just couldn't stop turning the pages. Many people died but its still action-packed with thrills.
1	Treasure island: Treasure island is a good classic book that gave me hours of reading enjoyment. All the pirate language made it hard to read sometimes but gave it realism that made it enjoyable.
1	A Great Adventure: I loved this book. I never read this one as a child, but I wish that I had. This book causes the imagination to run wild. I can see Treasure Island in my mind's eye! Well worth the read.
0	Good book, of course, difficult to use audio link.: Bought it because my daughter is reading it in school, and wanted it with the audio link so we could listen in the car. However, we could not figure out how to get the audio link to work.Disappointing.
1	How could I never have read this before?: This book was excellent. I can see why it was considered a classic. I had never read it before and got it because it was free. I will definitely read it again. Lots of action and a great story.
1	Classic: Great read. The writing style may be considered a bit dull by today's standards, but I really liked reading this. This is the original pirate adventure book. Yo ho ho!
1	Works Great: Tripp Lite INTERNET550SER 550VA UPS Compact Low Profile Standby 8 outlets w/ DB9 PortWe have been using our Tripp 550SER since October 2008. It meets our expectations for a great surge and small back up power supply. It would be nice if there were an option to turn off the beep alarm when the standby power is running.This is a great unit.
0	A Total Waste of Money: I've used this battery backup for less then a year and it no longer works. When the power goes off, so does everything plugged into this Tripp Lite battery backup. THEN the battery backup kicks in and starts beeping. Real useful. Total waste of money and could ruin your expensive computer equipment when you think that you are being protected from power surges and outages.
0	are you kidding me?: This is exactly why we now have TSA agents making everyone take their shoes off before boarding a plane.. honestly, why would you sell these?
1	moka brew coffee: Bought this product after drinking great coffee in Amsterdam that was pressure brewed,[senseo one cup],and this machine is close but no cigar.The taste from this machine is better than drip machines but not as frothy as the Senseo.Senseo draw-back is buying your coffee in those pods,very expensive.This machine is low pressure,maybe the difference in taste.
1	Good book: This product is pretty good. It lists so many websites available. It is mostly aimed at older homeschoolers, but there are things in it for all ages.
1	The only...: I ordered this book simply to replace the original book that has come unbound from years of use. I've been reading cards for close to 25 years now. My first deck was given to by my mother when I was an adolescent. I've come across many decks over the years, and have yet to find one that compares to the "Old Path". I mostly work with oracle cards now, however I use the tarot for precise information. The Old Path refers to pre-Christian era, when the Goddess was the divine deity. The cards are beyond beautiful and definitely feminine without being feminist. They have a beautiful balance between male and female. The cards relay precise information without being too harsh. These are my tarot for life. BLESSED BE!
1	Rush 2:Better than rush exept for music and tracks.: 22 Cars(including 6 to get from keys, Mountian Dew, and circuits), and better graphics. !Warrning! Bad tracks compared to rush. HEY!!!!! Where's the music that i like?
1	Good Movie!: This is a very old movie but it made a deep impact on me because it's very spiritual. This movie teaches how temptation can be deadly. I always like movies that leave you thinking and this one definitely does that. It's sexual in some parts and in other parts it's exciting and filled with suspense. I love to show this movie to my friends because most of them have never seen it before. I would recommend watching this movie on a dark stormy night. :)
1	Women are pure evil: The demon from hell that looked like a woman is praying on single she meets in bars in New York. Everytime she takes a man home with her while she having sex with them she starts to kill them. It takes a christian boy from the south to stop her evil deads.
0	Didn't like the paper quality and presentation: I bought them (Northanger Abbey, Persuasion, Mansfield Park and Emma) to complete my Jane Austen's collection, and honestly, didn't like the paper quality, it seems like they didn't even care for the presentation of them; it didn't look elegant, cheap to be more specific.
1	Definitley worth a read: Another classic that is definitely worth a read. Its one of those books that is slow in a couple of places but the suspense of the ending - or the expected ending keeps you reading. Oh you just want to go back in time and find your own Captain Wentworth!!
0	Shoddy quality: My review isn't about the story aspect of the book, but rather the physical quality of this edition. It's, well, crap. I don't know what I was expecting, but this wasn't it. As someone else said, it looks cheap. As if this was some new author who had her book printed independently. And the print is miniscule. I never complain about print, but this book is just dreadful. Tiny print and the lines are extremely close together.I'm supposed to be reading this for my book club, but I strongly suspect I'm going to be looking for another edition to use. I suppose I got what I paid for; the quality of this one is just awful.
0	Did not enjoy Persuasion on first read but may re-read: I studied this book in a first year Romantic & Victorian course which I did not enjoy. I found Persuasion difficult to get into and did not enjoy it. I studied an18th Century Fiction course and enjoyed Mansfield Park and other very interesting novels. I did enjoy this course.I'm returning to Austen because I recently purchased Pride & Prejudice and Zombies, and I feel it would be a crime not to read the original first.If I enjoy Pride and Prejudice I might just return to reading Persuasion again, just to see if I find it a much better read.
1	A wonderful novel: Jane Austen is often noted for her earlier works, namely Pride and Prejudice. Her later books are sometimes passed up, yet they can prove to be quite an enjoyable read.Anne Elliot, a wealthy, yet amazingly kind girl, finds herself in love with a penniless gambler who is making his profession as a sea captain. He proposes. She allows her friends to "persuade" her that this poor captain is not the man for her. He leaves, heartbroken, and over time becomes a wealthy man. He returns eight years later and Anne realizes that she never quite got over the man who stole her heart so many years ago. However, Captain Wentworth seems fairly content without her. Her shyness keeps the debonair captain from ever knowing her true feelings, but like any good Austen novel, the good girl always wins. Anne isn't as impetuous as Elizabeth Bennett, but her sweet nature will keep you rooting for her. Read and enjoy!
1	An excellent recording from Naxos and Juliette Stevenson: To be absolutely truthful, Anne Elliot may be too "nice" for you to find her as enjoyable as Emma Woodhouse or Elizabeth Bennett. Don't let that put you off however, this production was a joy! Persuasion is thoughtful and mature, and beautifully brought to life by Juliette Stevenson's reading. Her delightfully modulated voice, switches with ease between characters: she really shines as Anne's annoying sister Mary, you find yourself wishing for more of her! Male characters are believable as men - really, each character is rendered with admirable distinctness and individuality. Naxos' technical recording is of excellent quality as usual, seamless between takes. Jane Austen's keen insight into people's motives and character is piercing as always and her wit at society's expense is as apt today as 200 years ago. I have thoroughly enjoyed this recording and highly recommend it.
1	Love Kindle!: Everything was as expected. Timely delivery, great condition, worked as prescribed. If you question this product or this particular vendor, sleep easy. They are great! Thanks again! -w
0	Not the best: Like all Jane Austin novels, this was very class conscious, overly verbose, and difficult to relate to for a modern audience. It lacked the charm of some of her other books and the story dragged excessively. A long and wordy read, I would recommend reading "Sense & Sensibility" instead.
1	Persuasion: Austen at Her Best: Persuasion is Austen's version of Hans Christian Andersen's "The Ugly Duckling." How does Anne Elliot deal with her "faded bloom?" Throughout the novel, Austen depicts a most sympathetic character, Anne Elliot, that a woman of the1990's can readily identify with. Anne Elliot is pulled in each and every direction as she tries to fit in and find her own self. This is not just another one of Austen's cliched marriage plots. It is a book about learning to cope and evaluating one's culture.
1	Always a pleasure: Watched the movie10 or so times before reading the book. Just finished second reading. The humanity of it is so engaging. Misunderstandings and assumptions abound. People hiding their true feelings and fearful of speaking up. How true in our lives as well, making the outcome even more satisfactory.
0	The tape, I'm afraid, is very bad indeed.: I bought the tape with delight, but found that I can not listen to it. Whatever producers do to reduce the hissing of the 's' sounds, these producers did *not* do.Just the first few minutes of the first side were extremely distracting and irritating. I couldn't imagine the actress - whose voice is really lovely! - talking about the 'ssea' and Lyme Regissssss by the second half of the book.I am sorry to have to say it, but there it is.
0	Doesn't work!: Maybe we just got a bad one, but it doesn't work. The flower barely fits inside the wand (too wide) and gets stuck, and the magnet isn't powerful enough to pull it back out. My son was pretty disappointed with it, luckily it was just a stocking gift!
1	One of my all-time favorites: Listening to these recordings gives one the same feeling as one would have re-reading love letters that have been carefully tucked away. The very best tribute to Ella Fitzgerald there could possibly be ... Tommy brings these beautiful tunes to life with his incredible style of playing. This isn't a recording just for fans of Ella or Tommy ... it's a must-have for anyone who enjoys good, uplifting music.
0	Nice idea - poor quality device, firmware problems: After endless hours with Lingo and Dlink support I give up. There are firmware issues with this device, and Dlink and lingo point fingers at each other.Low volume, dropped calls, and frequent need to reboot the device.If you want lingo, don't use this device, get the standard box they provide.
0	Destroyer is Non-Anamorphic, Send a Message: Pick up the individual Conan the Barbarian SE release, but don't support this lame packaging of that disc with a non-anamorphic release of Conan the Destroyer. I was excited about picking this up, but declined once I realized that Destroyer was not enhanced for widescreen televisions. Would it have killed the studio? What a disappointment.
1	Go Conan!: All of the Conan movies are great, and no one fits the bill better than Arnold ;) There are some scenes in these movies though, that are....exposed....lots of nudity that I had never seen before....but that's ok, I could look at Arnold all day ;)
1	Quality Product: Well built and makes delicious coffee, tea and hot chocolate. Easy to use and loaded with features. Menu is user friendly.
1	My Second Keurig: Liked the first on so much, I bought a second one for the office, now I can enjoy my favority coffee all day.
1	Great for a single guy: Pros:Easy to use.Just the right ammount of coffee.Simple clean up.Good Selection of coffees.Great Customer Support.Cons:Coffee is a little weak, need to use two pods if you want it stongPods can be hard to find and expensive if not ordered from Amazon [...]Broke within two months. (Wouldnt register Pod, went through all the troubleshooting, but 'K' sent out a replacement ASAP and no problems since.This is the perfect at work coffee maker or for someone who's the only coffee drinker at home. Its great for the coffee drinker who values ease of use slightly ahead of taste. The coffee could be a little stronger.Go with the bold stuff even if you like mild coffees!
1	Love, Love, Love my Keurig!: This baby makes a great cup of coffee with no mess, no waiting, and no waste. It couldn't be easier! We are fairly picky about our coffee. We would grind our own and it had to be Eight O'Clock Columbian Roast and fresh. My husband thought a Keurig cup might be a nice occasional stand in for his regular pot, but after trying a wide variety of K cups from the sampler packs, he's found a new coffee that he likes more than his fresh ground Eight O'Clock... Caribou Blend. We also love Newman's Own Organic Special Blend Extra Bold. My kids have been having fun making hot chocolate as well as using just the hot water (hitting brew without adding a K cup) to cook their cup of noodles.
0	Forever Breaking-Have Gone Through @ Already!: I received the Keurig B70 for Christmas. I loved it for a few weeks. Then all the problems arose. I called customer service and had to hold for over an hour. They gave me the run around at first but then offered to ship me a completly new machine. I thought that would be the end of it, however, THE REPLACEMENT MACHINE IS BROKEN NOW TOO! Listed are the problems both machines had:* Both turn off right after brewing a cup, no matter how the settings are.* Both Eventually turn off right after they are turned on.* Second Machine (1 week old) leaves grinds in the cup and brews partial cups. The waterpump is not drawing water.* Now the second machine will not even brew.Have tried everything the manual says-Nothing is working!Now I am stuck with two broken (expensive) machines that WILL NOT WORK! I am on hold now with Keurig for the 9th time holding over 40 minutes now.DO Not Buy Until they fix the TERRIBLE glitches in this machine!
0	Stopped working properly after1 week: I loved the machine itself but after approx one week it started to brew a 4 oz cup of copy using the 7.25 cup size. In addition, every other cup was luke warm at best. If it worked as it was intended I would recommend it highly but instead I am extremely dissappointed at the poor quality of the product..
1	best b-70: this is my second one B-70 for the money is the best brewing system delivery was fast and free
1	Keurig B70 Platinum: Great delivery service and terrific price! This arrived right before Christmas as gift for my husband. We both are enjoying the coffee maker. We can pick our own coffee choices. It works great. We both love it!!!
1	This was gift: I bought this last Christmas for my Daughter and Son in law, Replacing the old one they had. they are thoroughly enjoying it.
0	Dont waist your time or $$: My in-laws got me this machine as a new house warming gift. I was so excited!! Then it only worked for 3 days. They took it back to costco and ordered me another one (same maching) here on Amazon. Got the Keurig B70 Platinum Brewing System on Friday, and today is Sunday and it will not brew a cup. It is like the water is not getting pushed threw to the 'down spout'. Same problem as the last machine that only lasted 3 days as well. I totally thought i had to be a fluke! But i will not be getting the same machine for a 3rd time. Sad, without coffee!!!
0	Price is rediculous..: Costco has the same machine for $145 with 60 k-cups... Just rediculous.. Starting to sigh on amazon.... Prices this season have been jacked sky high...
0	What is the opposite of Green?: In a world where we have floating islands of plastic. How does this type of product even get patented, let alone sold and popular? Each cup of coffee, tea, hot chocolate, has a plastic cup that, you guessed it, gets sent to the land fill.I have seen these becoming more popular, instead of doing away with such a trash producer, like I would love to believe this world is moving towards.There must be a better greener way to make coffee! Please don't buy this!I can't give it a star, I wish there were negative stars. (I guess I have to give it one, because it won't let me post without)
1	LOVE IT!: I absolutely LOVE this coffee maker. I am a new mother working full time and I can't survive the day without coffee in the morning. My daughter just turned 5 months old and I have learned that I must simplify my daily routine wherever possible. This coffee maker is so convenient it has changed my mornings and there is no preparation needed the night before. Just refill with water every few days and it's always ready to go. LOVE IT!
1	Review: Product was shipped on time and arrived as advertised - all works great ......... we were worried initially with the coffee maker as the first few cups of coffee had a metallic taste, but after cycling water thru a few times it tasted normal. We love the coffee maker - very convenient. Glad we purchased the larger model with a bigger tank of water - would have taken too many refills with a smaller capacity tank....... wish there would have been a non-commercial product line that had an option to connect to a water line.We love the little individual cups of coffee and the variety. I have found that it's easy to cut the top off the used cup, wash it out and put any brand coffee in it. Then I cover with a round piece of aluminum foil as a cap - works great........ a lot better than the individual cup holder we purchased........ only trick is to line up the puncture hole on bottom when inserting the cup in the holder.
1	WOW - MUCH BETTER THAN THE B60!!!: I purchased the B60 about a month ago and was relativley pleased at the ease and convenience of it. I no longer had to make a pot (or1/2 a pot) of coffee wondering if my husband was going to have any that particular morning or not. And then measuring, cleaning and throwing away...etc. Just a pain with a house full of kids running around so early in the morning! But I recognized that I had to brew at the smaller of the 2 sizes with an extra bold coffee to get close to what I liked. THEN, we received an early holiday gift this morning, and lo and behold, the B70!!! Right out of the box and at the 3rd cup size (which is 9.25 oz.) the taste was AMAZING! And actually a bit stronger than the smaller sized cup from the B60. I'm not sure if it brews it a few seconds slower, but all-in-all definitely worth the extra $50 or so for this model over the B60. I wish I had bought this model in the1st place!
0	Worst coffee maker: I bought the keurig about 2 years ago and without fail the company has had to send me a new one every 6 months. The brewer works great for about1 to 2 months and then goes down hill from there. Read all the reviews, look at the time frame the people have owned them! The good reviews are from the people who have owned them for 2 months or less! They have sent me 4....thats right 4!!!! replacement brewers and all do the same thing! Customer service has to go through the same process every time, I think I know them by name now. They defend this piece of junk and the bad ratings by saying they sell so many of them that they have to expect some problems....really....YOU ARE CHARGING $160 BUCKS!!!!! This brewer is a piece of crap....look at the Hamilton Beach instead....SignedKeurig Sucks!
0	It's not working well.: We were very pleased with the B-70 for about l1/2 years. But now it is failing. We did all the suggested fixes but it is still giving us problems. Called Keurig and they said we will sell you another one for $117.00. Don't know if I want to buy another one if it is going to go bad like the last one.
0	NOT worth it - tons of problems: I am so upset about my coffee maker. I received it for a gift in12/09 and for the last six months, it has randomly shut off, made inconsistent sized cups of coffee, and required me to become very creative with how I get my morning cup of coffee. I have descaled, I use bottled water and I have cleared the pin on so many occasions - I feel like a Keurig repair man. Nothing is worse than having to scream for your coffee in the wee hours of the morning. I had high hopes and the quality is sub-par for such an expensive coffee maker. The web is filled with discussion boards of the same complains and it is my understanding that Keurig is "surprised" with every phone call to their customer service. Wish I could recommend the machine (as I did to many people when I first got it) but it is NOT a good purchase. Lasts about six months on average from what I read on the web.
0	Platinum series is terrible: Bought a platinum series brewer. Wish I had never done so. Have to keep constantly unplugging and restarting to get it to work correctly. Piece of junk
1	Christmas Present: I bought this coffee pot for my daughter as a christmas/birthday present. She wanted it because they had one at work and loved it. She said the one I got her was even nicer then the one at work.
0	Unreliable and Unpredicatable.: This product is unrellibale and unpredictable. Multiple problems; makes a full cup intermittently. You never know when you get a full cup or a half cup. It also deposits coffee rinds in the cup of coffee, intermittently. Lastly after using this product for about10 days, it stopped working. The word Prime displayed on the screen, and followed manufacturer's recommended guidelines to correct, which it did for about 3 cups and then stopped working. The only thing that works; it makes noise like a constant motor running and would not shut off, nor does it make coffee. Don't buy this piece of junk.
0	What's the point? Long term revenue.: I recently experienced one of these appliances at my office where I was really impressed. Although we had to purchase our own K-Cups they ended up being relatively inexpensive ($.44/Kup) for the price of convenience. And so, I decided to purchase one for home. Then the problem started... K-cup prices skyrocketed... DOUBLING on Amazon to about $.90/Kup. I'm a sucker. I really wish I would have returned it. But I am far beyond the Amazon 30-day return policy. And so, the Keurig has been tossed into the garage sale pile.However, our Keurig has proved to be invaluable when anyone in the house is sick with the flu. Chicken broth, tea, and even Theraflu is effortless. If you have a home where this scenario is common, this appliance is perfect. But, the cost of the Kups are way to high for this to be any value.
1	Keurig B70 Coffee System: I am so happy with my Keurig B70 Platinum Coffee system. I am mostly impressed with the easiness of it's use, and the quality and reproducibility of each and every cup of coffee I make. I highly recommend that every household have one.
1	Wonderful: Very happy with this purchase. Easy enough to set up. I really like being able to set the beverage temperature. I like the highest setting at192-degrees for my beverages, but others in my family don't, and they are able to have "cooler" hot coffee.
0	Yes it's short-cupping: Well, now we are a little leery about replacing, but we have invested in about 5 boxes of K-cups (taking advantage of sales at Kohl's) soo..this is going back to Costco tomorrow. We read the reviews but thought that the newer models had replaced the older ones-guess not. We had been using bottled water entire time so we knew in 2 months it wasn't a build up issue. It's short-cupping and going back.
1	Keurig B70: I am very pleased with my Keurig B70. It easy and fast to use. I love the different varieties of coffee and tea offered. I now can enjoy a cup of coffee or tea anytime during the day without the hassles of a conventional coffee maker and so I do. I do miss it when out of town. I am considering getting one for my small office staff so they and I can enjoy it at work.
1	Wait for Product: Had to wait 6 weeks from Amazon for this brewer. Then the order was finally cancelled so I bought it from JR and got it in three days.
0	returned: I returned it. It was broken when I received it. I was very unhappy with the return process trying to get a return # was very difficult and felt like I was imposing on the staff. I have bought many things on the site and have never had to return anything. I ended up getting one from the Keurig web site (of couse it cost a little bit more). Your welcome to call me on my cell @ 520-820-2790.
1	brewer is very stylish: Let me say this brewer is very stylish, extremely simple to use, and has bare minimal clean up however, the coffee does not have any richness or flavor. It is very watered down.
0	I CANT BELIEVE I ACTUALLY TOOK THE TIME TO READ THIS BOOK!!!!!!!!!!!!!: I must say that I absolutely hated this story. I describe this book with three words and these words are...pointless and confusing. Trick of the Eye is extremely slow for the first 80 pages and then after that the story gets so mixed up and confusing that you can't understand it. This book was so confusing I don't even know what the story is really about. And as and ending note, I would like to say that the first 80 pages could have been written in eight!!
1	What a cool album...: Mark Isham has a gift for capturing, even setting, moods. His pieces evoke feelings and moods. Not quite background music but not quite music you actively listen to, his music allows parts of us to arise, giving us pause to reflect, to wander, to dream.This is the soundtrack for a great movie but the soundtrack stands on its own. It is exploratory and adventurous. There are several jazz/blues numbers on it but there is also some experimental music that is difficult to categorize. It is at once entrancing yet challening. That may sound a bit technical but the one word that describes the whole thing is 'cool', as in the jazz kind of cool.There aren't many like this one to find. That's what makes it so good. If you are looking for some creative and different music, this is a great place to wander.
1	Plano Four Handgun Case: All I can say is WOW! These are some pretty big hangun cases! For the price, these cases will do the trick. Also, keep in mind that you get what you pay for. The hinges are completely plastic so if the cases need to last for a while be sure to take precautions by NOT overloading, stacking, or excessive opening & closing. They will fit 4 semi- autos or 2 large framed revolvers comfortably. I will not advise putting more than two semi-autos on the same level. And, only one large framed revolver on one level because shifting does occur (although minimal) to avoid scratching or scraping metal surfaces. There is a space for a padlock! And, the foam is durable and safe for all handgun finishes. If you need a handgun case for multiple firearms, I recommend this product. If you have a special firearm with lots of accessories or bulky parts, BUY this immediately to keep things in one location and in reach. Overall, I rate this product 4 out of 5!
1	Good value: might not stand the test of time, but at this price you cant go wrong. Great for camera equipment, and handguns.
1	Great storage case: I actually didn't get this for pistols. It works great to store our electronic depth sounder and fish finder with all its cables and attachments.
1	A book for all ages: I'm12 but I really like this picture book. I learned a lot about what Henry Thoreau was trying to do when he built a cabin by Walden Pond, and it was fun learning it through this book. The illustrations are funny and I like how Henry solves his problems. I also like Henry Hikes to Fitchburg, which is even funnier because Henry makes his friend learn a lesson in a funny way. I also recommend another great book about Henrey Thoreau, that especially girls of all ages will like, Louisa May and Mr. Thoreau's Flute. It talks about how Henrey Thoreau helped Louisa May Alcott learn to like the outdoors and learn to like writing. Henry's funny in that book too so I think readers will like it too.
1	Wedding Goddess is divine: Wedding Goddess is a soulful look at the sacred ritual of marriage. Laurie Sue Brockway brings you into the world of weddings in the most beautiful, altruistic sense rather than how the machine of the wedding industry commercializes it. Laurie Sue is a minister who customizes weddings to the individual--there's no pat formula here, just two people in love coming together in the way that makes them feel most connected. This book is for those who are getting married but also for everyone who wants to open your heart and honor the committment to yourself and humanity.
1	Scary for Grown Ups!: Before "Leaving Las Vegas" Mike Figgis directed this rather nasty adult thriller which features Kim Novak's most recent film appearance to date. She's brilliant in this small part as a dying woman reunited with the son she gave up for adoption. As she slips into morphine induced dementia, he stumbles into...incest?...adultery?...ghosts?... I'm not sure but anyway, my blood ran cold for weeks. This is recommended especially to people who miss Ken Russell's exuberant directorial excesses!
0	For Collectors Only?: This is far from being the best NRBQ album available. As the "best bar band in the world", they have made a series of loose but imaginitive and fun recordings. Later, when they tried to make "serious" recordings, some of the fun may have been missing, but this was made up for by top-notch writing and interesting arrangements. This project is neither tight nor fun. "Me and the Boys" is perhaps the only memorable song. The singing and playing are lacksidaisical, and overall it seems like the whole band would rather be elsewhere. You might want to skip this one unless you are a die-hard fan.
1	A Different Sequel to American Graffiti.: Most of the Original Cast are back, expect for Oscar-Winner:Richard Dreyfuss. This film tells the tales of Seven Friends (Ron Howard, Cindy Williams, Paul Le Mat, Charles Martin Smith, Candy Clark, Mackenzie Phillips and Bo Hopkins), which they are in Different Situations in the Evolution of the Mid-Sixties.Directed by B.W.L. Norton, this is Surprisngly Well Made Sequel. Written by Willard Huyck, Gloria Katz, George Lucas and Bill L. Norton. This has a lot of Bright Moments. Harrison Ford has a Cameo as a Motorcylce Officer and Delroy Lindo, then Unknown has a Scene with Actor:Smith. This was a Small Hit in Theaters. Some Might have a hard time watching this film, because it`s filmed in Different Aspect Ratios of this Film. Part of the Movie is Filmed in Panavision. Grade:A-.
0	No where near the Original: If you like the original. You may be disapointed. I was. I wanted to see a real continuation. What I got was meany hard to follow snips. I think the director could not get them all in one place again. So, they wrote small movies for each.
0	Not as Good as the Original!!!: More American Graffiti is kind of sad to me. It shows how everone is living in 3 or 4 time zones. It's sad that Terry the toad's girlfriend forgets him and becomes a hippie. The ending is the most sad because you know John Milner is about to die because of a drunk driver. I probably wouldn't recommend MORE AMERICAN GRAFFITI!!!
1	All The Great Oldies!: Wow, all the great oldies from the movie. And arrived very quickly, even though Standard shipping was selected.
0	A clear look at Islam: A good resource to take you behind all the headlines and propaganda to the heart of Islam. The book is a thorough and clear presentation for those of us who know little about Islam. Plainly written and easy to search.
0	Horrible reception: I had this hooked up with digital cable. I tried going through the regular cable line and S-video. Going through the regular cable line resulted in an awfully grainy screen. Going through S-video didn't make it any less grainy, but it completely washed out the color of the signal. All the whites on the screen took over the other colors. Do not go with this card.
1	Amazing Immune booster: Cats Claw is such an effective immunobooster that the AMA has listed it as a drug to avoid in the case of organ transplant. I'm sold.
1	jumpstarter: Fantastic product! Good value. We can say nothing negative about it. We carry it with us on trips. Family members borrow it. Wow - what more can be said.
1	Works well so far, radio needs improvement: The powerpack delivers but it promises. Portable power, both DC and AC. Trickle charger and the light work well. I haven't had any problems with my unit yet but the radio definitely needs improvement. Although it has a digital tuner, adjacent stations seem to overlap. Also the speaker is very small.
0	Xantrex 852-2000 XPower Powerpack 600HD Portable Battery: I was disapointed. I had hoped it would hold a charge for a lot longer, but it didn't. I used this in a craft booth to light 4 strings of Christmas lights and a tree. It only lasted about 4 - 5 hours. When the battery began to run low, it "Buzzed" really loud.I wish I had picked the bigger one.
0	Worst product I have ever purchased: My Xantrex XPower Powerpack 600 Heavy Duty is not good for an emergency. It is an emergency. The unit does not hold a charge. It takes days to fully charge and loses its charge by10% each day.Xantrex customer service has not been helpful other than to say that I should charge it through my car cigarette lighter.I ask, what should I do charge it all the time. Thats the only way their will be any power when you need it... I bought this item to help if I have a problem... It is the problem.
1	Keep one in your trunk: I purchased this product to use primarily in case my battery died, and secondarily as a portable power source when camping or away from a source of electricity.The powerpack works great when starting any size car with a completely dead battery. The built-in inverter is great to charge cell phones or run small appliances when camping for example.The display is very useful, showing either the percentage charge or the real-time wattage being used.Be forewarned, though, that this item is heavy and portable only inasmuch as it has a handle. I wouldn't lug it too far. Also, while charging is quick through the cigarette lighter cable, it takes a long time through the AC adaptor.Overall, a great purchase.
1	Really great, but...: I used this unit in my travel trailer for about a year before it was stolen. I ran my TV off it, laptop, and when tent camping used it for lights and my laptop and to recharge camera batteries.PROS: Does what it says. Solid; built like a Sherman tank. Idiot-proof. TV ran for about 3 hours, laptop about 4 hours, and15 watt light...forever. Started my car instantly. Plugs high-quality, very solidly built.CONS: WAY heavy; incredibly heavy. Takes forever to recharge, even on car charger; don't believe the stats. The radio and light on the unit are useless and incredibly cheap.
0	Readout Never Worked ;-(: I've had this product for about a year. The readout that tells you how much charge is left never worked!When I first got the product, the readout didn't seem to work according to the directions, but it took me some use to figure out it didn't work properly. I could find out how much charge was left, but it didn't display the info as the directions stated. The item is so heavy and bulky, I decided not to bother returning it and just live with the inconvenience. . .Now, after three or four camping trips worth of use, the readout doesn't work at all! There's no way to find out how much charge the unit has remaining. I just have to find out when it dies. Not very convenient at all.
0	Somebody Help: I have nothing but trouble with the battery company that sent the power pack 600HD. I have never been able to charge it because of a defective charger. They cannot send me a replacement because they do not have one. They want me to pay full postage to send back the defective charger. They offered me a choice of replacement or junk and refund. I chose junk and refund since it is impossible to send such a heavy thing back at my cost. I bought this in August and have not received a refund, am being charged with interest, and have a $325 item I cannot use. When I called "Mark" he told me I was unreasonable to talk to and to call back when I calmed down. HELP. I only want to charge what I think would be a good battery to take camping or stop charging me and calling me unreasonable.
0	THEY TRY BUT THEY CAN'T: They try hard, but they can't make Van Damme seems like a good actor. The plot about twin is a clever idea, but it doesn't work at all. Bad...........
0	A Real Snoozer: Hard to believe that someone could take one of the most dramatic events of the twentieth century and make it this mind-numbingly boring. Written with an overly verbose, convoluted style, it just never seemed to get to the point. NOTE to future authors: three page end notes have a name - THEY'RE CALLED CHAPTERS. The text reads like a caricature of a blabbering communist from an old movie from the Fifties in Hollywood.
0	Ten Days That Shook the World: I read a lot of history books and I just found this very boring. I gave up after reading 50%.
0	Giant Disappointment: Hilary Mantel has a unique ability to tell a story through the conversations of her characters. The book is carried along by each character's thoughts and words. This story told in the Irish dialect of its subjects, is at times amusing and often poignant, but ultimately depressing. Frankly there were no surprises in this story. It ground along with the giant and his retinue heading for their predictable end.After reading Mantel's last book, Bring Up the Bodies, I was really disappointed in this one. She has certainly honed her craft since this early work.
1	DreamCatcher!: Jonesy, Beaver, Henry, and Pete are four young friends who save a boy named Duddits,who had a syndrome. They helped Duddits from other boys in another words they were his protectors. From that day they found a special bond between them who immunes them with each other.Every year they go up to Maine for their annual hunting trip.While they were their they saw strange things happening, and witness, for the first time, creatures beyond their imagination. Soon they found out that they are taking part in alien invasion. Two friend died during the book Pete and Beaver. The other two friends Jonesy and Henry save the Earth from contaminated water supply with a disease called Byrus. In ending they found out that they saved the world by aliens from their friend "DreamCatcher," Duddits.
1	Satisfying King: As Stephen King gets older, his books get bigger, as seems to happen to most authors. Sometimes though, they fail to satisfy. This one did not.Coming off of his horrible accident where he was hit by a van, King included a lot of his pain and feelings of growing older in this book. It makes the book more personal, and more refreshing. There is the true Stephen King in the emotions of the characters.Being an alien invasion book, I enjoyed it too for it's unique spin on alien life, and how they might invade. I don't think this was overall as creepy as some of his other works have been, though this certainly had its moments.All that said, the book wasn't literary greatness, but I wasn't expecting it to be. It was a horror novel by King, and it was entertaining. I wasn't expecting anything but that.But I'm glad I read it. Well done.
0	SK's worst ever, really0 stars: I hated it. Bad plot, poorly delivered, terrible book. SK has written some really good books, but this one was so bad I have not read another SK since. I do not believe would even be published if unknown author. Don't waste your time!
0	Tried to like it...: As a huge fan of early Stephen King works, I had heard that this was so much like "IT" and "The Stand" and so I was excited about reading it. In my opinion it was totally vulgar and I don't think that all that vulgarity was necessary to create the story. I found the book to be confusing as well, towards the end. There were times when I had to stop reading it as I felt sick to my stomach....maybe that's a good thing??!! King is still in my opinion an extremly great writer but I thinkat times he tries too hard to be gross. All in all, I was disappointed...hopefully the next one will be better...
0	Not His Best: Like many others I am a big fan of Stephen King. Most of his books are terrific but "Dreamcatcher" joins his other two bombs, "The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon" and "The Talisman". The first part of the book is well written but it later deteriorates into gibberish. I had a hard time telling who was in who's mind or who was doing what to which when. As someone once said "In every fat book there's a thin book trying to get out". King claims to have written this whole book with a fountain pen. I hope he has gotten over his writer's cramp by now so he can start on a better book up to his usual higher standard. Think thin (or is it "Thinner".
1	One of Stephen King's best novels.: Definately one of the best books I've read in awhile. Even though the book is long the story grips you and you can't put the book down. Can't wait for the movie to come out.
0	Gak. . .: I've been reading S.K. since1980: I'm pretty well acquainted with his writing. Sooo. . .This book is really, really bad. The story is SO absurd (WHERE the creatures came from had to be the lowest and most perverse idea S.K. had ever had); I hated every character (wanted them ALL to die after the first few chapters)and the story itself was plodding (it took the characters about a thousand pages to travel from Point A to Point B).This was a book written just to get something new on the shelves.I was very disappointed. I can see the book on my shelf with the bookmark about fifty pages from the end; can't bring myself to finish it.I'm warning everyone away from this one.
0	Makes Tommyknockers look like genius: I never thought I would say this, but this makes 'The Tommyknockers' look like a really excellent book... this is not up to par with King's recent offerings such as 'Bag of Bones' and 'Hearts in Atlantis.' King goes for the the gross-out in this book, and leaves the reader cringing with graphic images of various bodily functions. I am a big King fan, but I cannot in good conscience reccommend this book.
1	Audio CDs are Copy Protected: I thought the story was great. Jeffrey DeMunn does an excellent job reading and acting it. Be advised though - you will not be able to listen to these 20 CDs on your computer nor will you be able to rip them down to a single MP3 CD.
1	Very Good: While I would not say this is the be all end all Stephen King book, I think traditional King fans will be pleased with this new offering. It is a throwback to It,and Tommyknockers and I enjoyed it much more than both of those. In a nutshell the story is about 5 friends, one having Downs Syndrome who is also a powerful Phychic, He in a way passes his gift along to his 4 friends who must use their skills to survive an alien invasion while hunting in the woods. It is very scary at times at really gross to (which is good to some people :)). In closing I will say you will never be able to sit on the toilet without thinking twice again.
0	His15 MINUTES ARE UP.: I was a die-hard SK fan until about 4 books ago. He's lost his touch. I so wanted to like this book, but it's bad, really bad. Incomprehensible and all over the place, and much, much too long. Sorry, Mr. King.
0	Not as good as most of his books: I have always been an huge S.K. fan. I was disappointed in this one, however. It starts out good, but towards the end it becomes long, drawn out and boring. I had to make myself finish it. The concept of the book is good, and had the latter part of the book flowed as easily as the first part, it would have been very good.
1	Riveting! Reads like a true crime thriller!: Fast paced book. Though I have no connection to finance, I was intrigued by the story on the back cover and began reading. It's incredible that this is a true life story. The only dry part was at the end with the criminal trials and some of the finance was hard to follow but I just skipped over the technical mumbojumbo. This guy is innocent.
1	it is very good: i like this dvd, and the service was good,and it came when they said it would. i wish there was a fourth season of this show.i would get it.
1	Perfect for a Companion Piece to a Young Man's Wallet: I purchased this for my grandson as a companion piece to his wallet. He makes sure he carries this everywhere along with his wallet. It prevents carrying a lot of loose change and it's very appropriate for a boy to carry since there is nothing 'girlie' about it. My dad always carried a change pouch too since he couldn't stand loose change jingling around in his pocket, and my grandson enjoys it for the very same reason. I highly recommend this product.
0	Squeeze coin Pouch: Nice leather. The squeeze portion broke immediately and I was never able to use it. Overall not a well designed product.
1	How Fi Dance!!: Whoa!! This DVD is tight work, for real. This DVD breaks everything DOWN SO WELL (BLASE, SIGNAL THA PLANE, LOG ON, ON LINE, EXCEPT THE HEEL TO TOE). I cannot wait for Vol. 2 to come out. The LEARN segment is cool for real, but the SEE segment is off tha chain. This DVD is worth the money if you are seriously trying to learn the dances, but if you are just trying to see the dances then this is not the DVD because the SEE segment is not showing anything but 'sex in the club with your clothes on'. I have never seen anything like this in any of the Reggae clubs that I have been to, but hey not every club is the same. How Fi Dance is cool with me.
0	Good recording of a forgettable concerto: This would be a reasonable purchase for one with intense desire to complete a Yo-Yo Ma or John Williams collection. However Williams' cello concerto presents many problems for the listener, with poor development and often monotonous forays into atonalism. The technical aspects of the recording and Ma's performance are excellent, but far more beautiful compositions have been written for this instrument.
0	shafi: I have been looking for a book for my children to share thorugh illustrations and imagination the stories of my childhood when it came to the Legend of the Old Befana. I found this to be the closest so far yet it does not follow through on the tradion that follows the Befana each year in Italy. It did not captivate my our my son and I found myself having to more explaining than sharing The drawings are nice though.
1	This is a must for all du Maurier fans!: If you enjoyed her classic, Rachel, then this book is a must. Once again Daphne du Maurier succeeds in evoking the mystery and charm of Cornwall by setting her intriguing characters and rivetting story plots in this beautiful area.
1	Just what I needed.: This was high on my Wife's Christmas list and it was reasonably priced, can't ask for much more than that.
1	the gift: my favorite Christmas music, hard to find. was glad to be able to find it at amazon at this price.
1	Gödel's Proof: The copy I read is the edition of Nagel and Newman's1958 book revised in 2001 by Douglas Hofstadter, author in1979 ofGödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid. Nagel and Newman do a good job in their first six chapters of orienting the reader towards Gödel's proof, and give a clear overview of the proof in their detailed chapter seven. They don't overwhelm the beginner (for whom the book was written) with the painstaking details of the proof. They don't describe the construction of a formal language or discuss recursive functions. I think the book deserves its status as a classic of popular mathematics and I recommend it as a first look at Gödel's Incompleteness Theorems.For an accessible look at the historical background in mathematics and logic to Gödel's work, see Morris Kline'sMathematics: The Loss of Certainty. For a scholarly biography of Gödel, see John Dawson'sLogical Dilemmas: The Life and Work of Kurt Godel.
0	defective product: I have used other Yves St, Laurent Touche Eclat products, but thought I'd try the peach. I am very disappointed. The color itself was very harsh, and after the second attempt to push the button to get the product released into the brush, it quit working entirely. I assume the product was old, but under any circumstances it was defective. From now on I'm buying this product in a store where I can return it.
1	three powers: the power of three is a very good book the amazing combinations of life and fantasy are exsqisit and although i am not all the way through i am already searching for another,i am a reader that likes every type of fantasy, but i like the strongest the best so when they learn about electricity i got kind of dissapointed but other than that it is a terrific book.
0	Side Effects: In the literature it always states that it is extremely rare for people to experience side effects. However, I do NOT think this is the case if you are very sensitive to medications. If you are, you will want to take a much lower dose of this potent herb. The recommended dose threw me into a detox that was utterly miserable and lasted for weeks. It took me a while to put two and two together as I just thought I was sick. The same day I stopped taking this product, my symptoms went away.
0	Can't hold a candle to Billy Blanks: Don't waste your money on this one. I wish I could get my money back. Poor taping quality, poor instructions, poor everything!
1	Rush Revealed: I have been a Rush fan since I was in Jr. High back in the mid 80's. As I became older, I realized what a powerhouse of talent these guys are. This documentary is well put together, and despite what others have said....it does not seem rushed to me. It tracks the band back to friendships that started before the music. I found it very interesting and all in all a touching story about a group of good friends who have shared the struggles, highs, tragedies, success and fame while making some of the most complex progressive rock music in history.All three seem to be just simple good guys, and that really comes through in this story. Awesome music and a real "suck it" to the industry that didn't really want them to succeed.Great....just great.
1	Rush fans will love it: Both DVD's are great. Make sure you watch both. I understand the band personalities much more now. It covers from the very first high school gig thru and after Peart's family loss and the band reuniting.If you like RUSH, you really NEED to watch this.
1	The Greatest Band in the Galaxy!: Having been a fan of Rush for nearly thirty years, this film/documentary was truly enjoyable. The directors did an outstanding job capturing the human side of these three musical pioneers. Well worth the wait!!
1	Must see rock film: Not one for hyperbole, and hard to please, quite frankly. I feel like I've seen it all. But Beyond the Lighted Stage truly is one of the best rock films (the best?) AND documentaries I've ever seen. I've now watched it twice and I liked it BETTER the second time!We live in a mixed up, tortuous world. But a beautiful world too - where good people can get together to do great things. And - do it their way. What a great story. Neil Peart's Dad's comments about the day he joined Rush - man, if that doesn't get you fired up and warm your heart, nothing will.
1	Awesome!: What a great DVD for Rush fans. The early videos are great. The number of musicians that have been influenced by Rush is huge. They truely are a unique band--love them or hate them. One of the best things in the video is the dinner at the hunting lodge. I couldn't stop laughing! Those scenes are worth the price right there. Alex has a tremendous sense of humor. I think the most important thing these guys have is a true friendship for each other and they don't take themselves overly seriously. Really, a must-see for Rush fans.
1	Rush Fans Grab this You will LOVE it: If you are a true Rush fan you will really Love this, it gives back history and shows that these 3 guys are truly Rock Gods that don't get the glory and praise that they desirve. After all this time they can still write and preform truly outstanding,meaningful music that will just kick your ass, They have infulinced rock music more than most and yet the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame still won't see how truly outstanding they are, maybe they should watch this DVD.
1	Great video: Tremendous career retrospective from a band like no other. Very, very well done, as with Dunn's other work. I am a huge Rush fan, and like any, this gave some unique perspectives deeper into the band, tied up some loose ends--and left a few more mysteries in our grasp. Bravo!
1	obviously talented: This is a good disk. In fact very good. However it's a bit frustrating because there are flashes of absolute and utter brilliance....Then there are parts that are a bit forgettable.In a just world "couldn't you tell" would be a top10 hit on the radio. "Emily's dead to me" is quite delicate and beautiful. "Hide, run away" is also very good. This guy definately has a knack for creating hooks and emotional tension in his songs.
1	Clearly one of the best debuts of05': BC Camplight didn't make a perfect record but his debut "hide, run away" clearly marks the arrival of a true talent. His writing style, which has been compared to Burt Bacharach and Randy Newman, along with his macabre lyrics and humorously modest approach are a winning combination. Check out this cd if you are a fan of Todd Rundgren, Brian wilson, Randy Newman, Burt Bacharach, and Belle and Sebastian.
0	Not as advertised: My son is very disappointed because the illustrations on the "Look Inside" feature are nowhere to be found. It is possible that this may be the best story ever written but please deliver what is advertised. Have a fabulous day.I called Amazon and some lady with a thick foreign accent answered. She was very nice and had a good handle on the language. She assured me that she would send a copy that matched the description on the website. Unfortunately I received the same book. There are no illustrations in this book. This is a bad experience with this book but I still love Amazon.
0	Not the best telling: I read three versions of the Arthurian legends recently, and this one was the weakest. The language is somewhere between Malory's archaic form and modern prose, but does not succeed well at being either. The tales were also, in my opinion, less well told than in the others.For your consideration, I read La Morte D'Arthur in an abridged version and Roger Lancelyn Green's "King Arthur and His Knights of the Round Table" from the Puffin Classics series. I enjoyed Green's telling the best, as it was credibly compiled from a number of works (including Malory) and had some excellent atmospheric illustrations. Though it is a Puffin Classics edition, I did not find the usual condescension or "dumbing down" that often occurs in youth literature.Get Green's version. It was just as cheap right here on Amazon, and well worth every penny.
1	The "Citizen Kane" of Canadian Frat Movies: Just like my title said, this movie is the "Citizen Kane" of Canadian Frat Movies. It's ultra raunchy, made up of fart humor, vomit humor, getting people high at a funeral, among other things. It's politically incorrect, and darn proud of it. Catch it if you can.
0	Terrible graphics, OK recipes: As soon as I opened this book, I didn't want to make any of the recipes, simply because the pictures were so awful. The layout is amatuerish and the photos are simply unappetizing. Presentation counts almost as much as flovor- if this is what my meals are going to look like, then I'll pass.
1	WE ALL NEED TO READ THIS ONE & PASS IT ON!: WOW! She did her homework! It is all in here. Some startling insights and provocative thinking. After you read this one, you may rethink your reality. Perhaps we all need to read this to make sure we haven't overlooked some significant details! This should be in EVERY school, EVERY hospital, EVERY clinic, EVERY doctors office and every child protection agency office. If you suspect Abuse- get this book. You will gain valuable insight and will be able to see things you might otherwise have missed!
0	Not the best study guide available: I used this book in a TOEFL preparation course for about a month and found it a bit disappointing. The book's explanations are quite technical (which is sometimes helpful, especially in the grammar section) but my intermediate-level students all found the practice exercises in the book too easy. The CD-ROM practice tests, on the other hand, were too hard. Some of the Writing section's explanations were good--especially with thesis statements and conclusions--but the Reading section was ridiculously banal. In addition, there aren't enough practice tests, especially in comparison with other TOEFL study materials available on the market. For the price you're paying, you'd be better off buying Longman's Complete Preparation (for intermediate to advanced students), Longman's Introductory Preparation (for beginner students), or Barron's TOEFL book with 8 practice tests.
1	Homework review: This is a great book by Edgar Allan Poe that is filled with great "Poe"ms. My favorite is the poem called "The Raven." Some of the poems are a bit scary, and there are some scary pictures. I would recommend it for ages 8+. There are also poems that you can't find in any of Poe's books because they are shortened versions of larger, unabridged poems. Also, some of the poems have to do with death. Thanks to Brod Bagert, (editor) Carolynn Cobleigh, (illustrator) and of course, Edgar Allan Poe.
1	very good.....: if u dnt read at least one work of edgar allen poe by the time ur 30, u mite as wel b pronounced brain dead....
1	An abbreviated collection of Como's Christmas songs: This CD has only10 of Perry Como's songs on it. If you like Perry Como, you should get a bigger collection, or buy this one for no more than $6 brand new. It is a small album, but if you're a big fan you could pay a small price for it and be happy with it.
0	Not as I remember: I used to watch the Perry Como show as a kid and thought he was cool back then. This CD was a bit disappointing - I thought the music was listless and didn't have quite the Christmas spirit/enthusiasm as I had hoped.
1	"The Mummy" by Marion: I was a big fan of the orginal "Mummy" and was anxious to see the remake. The first time I did I laughed! I thought it was so stupid I'd never care to see it again BUT BOY WAS I WRONG. The next day I wanted to see it again, and then again. I ended up seeing it about 7 times in 3 days, I was that hooked. And the music is so fantastic I rushed to get the CD. Plus I got the book! This is one of the BEST movies I have ever seen; and it's a unique combination of horror and comedy. But one question: If Imhotep was all wrapped in linen, HOW did he scratch "Death is only the beginning" inside his sarcophagus? And where did he get that massive hole in his head? These and other questions are worth overlooking. Watch this movie!
1	An excellent must-see: In this powerfully wonderful action film, severeal men look for a treasure and unearth a horrible master of complete cursed destruction, an all-powerful all-deadly mummy who was mummified alive and cursed. He rains on plague after another plague on Egypt.No one knows how to destroy this monster. He tries to reincarnate Anck-su-namun, his fomer love. The film has violent action,powerful mummies, and a scantily clad woman to enjoy looking at. The film is wonderful ... and action-packed for125 minutes of power and suspense. The only flaw was Beni, the stupid character. An absolute must-see for the whole family
1	Not "Great" but a "Good" one!: All right - I admit, the movie is good: Good jokes, good action, good sound, A-M-A-Z-I-N-G special effects, a little bit of frightning here, a little bit of frightning there.. Well, ok, so what this a "4 star movie" and not "5 star"? It's resemblance to Indiana Jones! I know it's a totaly different story and all, but I can't help it - It's just too similar in the music, the places shown and the characters..
1	The Mummy: The first time I saw this movie I thought it was not going to be good. Like who wants to see a mummy chase people. But till I saw the whole move it was great. It was filled with action pack adventure and laughter. The Mummy was about a group of people searching for a long-lost treasure but unearthed a 3,000 year old legacy. Now it is going after them since they broke the curse.Do they have time to destroy the mummy before the world comes to an end. This is a good action epic, visual effect, and great story telling. With great actors like Brendan Fraiser, Rachel Weisz,John Hannan,Jonathon Hyde,Kevin J. O'Connor and Arnold Vosloo. This is a great movie to see.
0	Terrible movie. Don't waste your time or money.: After viewing for about10 minutes, I noticed a disagreeable odor being emitted from the disc. It wasn't the disc, it was that stupid movie. If this is what passes for entertainment now days, we are in worse shape than I imagined.
0	no no no no NO!!: This movie sucks big time, although the special effects were OK. ILM could of done alot better. PLEASE STAY WELL CLEAR OF THIS FILM!! Would the producers of this film please promise us that they won't make a sequel. ILM please don't work with these films. Their ruining your reputation.
0	The special fx were sub-par and that was the best part!: Avoid this film at all costs! The special effects, the film's only redeeming feature, are sub-par because they are used in a hideously predictable way. A horror film that doesn't scare at all. Actors who are best suited for roles in the adult film industry and a script which was evidently buried in the desert and never found. Who the hell green-lighted this effects-laden dungheap? I've wasted my money on other film like Deep Impact and Conspiracy Theory, but this film was a waste of my time! I could have spent those125 minutes doing something else. Maximum Overdrive, the Emilio Estevez tour de force, was at least brainless fun. This film is just brainless. Do Hollywood a favor and buy or rent some pornography or Faces of Death instead of this cinematic black hole. Don't give them your money! (I saw this film for free and it still drained me of my valuable time. Don't waste your life, don't buy or rent this film!)
1	A vastly amusing movie: I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. While it lacks the lovely atmospheric creepiness of the1932 film it claims to be a remake of, it has a good-natured sense of adventure and is well cast. In truth it seems to be more of a remake in the style of Hammer Studio's Mummy films, but thankfully does not include the title character lurching around shedding bandages everywhere. Considering the stomach-dropping, heart-sickening disappointment the other big "horror" remake,"The Haunting," from the summer this film came out, and despite the occasional plot-hole (but let's face it, this film wasn't intended to be a ground-breaking, truth-shattering film, it was meant to be entertainment), "The Mummy" did not deserve the poor reviews it got from the critics.
0	super predictable rubbish: The original is much better, at least in terms of including a few unexpected twists and turns. If you want to know what is going to happen next in this cgi "masterpiece", just apply the following formula ... what new element has just been introduced to the picture? how might it suddenly spring to life and kill someone? The scene with the scarab beetle being picked off the wall is a good example.BORING!!!!
0	Belongs on MST3K: This was possibly the worst movie I have seen in a long time. Very few films manage to get everything wrong, but this one did. Expect a weak plot and a poor computer generated setting laced with general inaccuracies. There are a few moments of good acting with some characters, but they are canceled out by the horrible 'acting' of characters such as the mummy, which stares at a character for ten seconds, then growls.
1	Great Special Effects With Humor Throughout: I thought that this movie was great. I love Brendan Frasier's acting ability and I can always expect to laugh when I am watching a film he is in. I felt that the story line could have moved a little faster at the beginning with a little less violence but all and all a fun movie to watch.
0	I wasn't sure if it was supposed to be a comedy or a horror: Visual effects aside, this movie was really quite dumb. My eleven year old twins enjoyed it and that was about the intellectual level the film. It seemed like Brendan Frazier wasn't quite sure if the film should be a comedy or a horror show. It seemed as though he wasn't quite sure how to act, funny or scared. It was quite violent at times and too many people died. I would not rent it again. If it wasn't for the visual effects--I would have rated the film1 star.
1	Rachel Wiesz is incredible!: I loved this movie, and that surprised me, because my tastes tend toward Bogart movies, or Gregory Peck or Audrey Hepburn. But this movie is wonderful! one minute you're scared out of your mind, and the next you are laughing. Not many movies can pull that off. Frasier is also solid (in my opinion) in his role. OK, so he's not Bogart, but still convincing in his charactar. Rachel Wiesz is nothing short of amazing! Of course, those big brown eyes do help! I think she has to be the most stunningly beautiful actress around. "The Mummy" is no classic, but its still worth the money for one wild ride!
1	This film is not bad!: Well, I loved the Indiana Jones movies and [guess what!] I love this one as well!The special effects are really good and many of the scenes are hilarious.However, I've only seen this film once, so I'm not sure if it starts to get boring once you've seen it a few more times.
1	A Thoroughly Satisfying Adventure Movie: The Mummy is high quality entertainment. It does a great job of entertaining, that's saying something. Some movies can't even do that. But this succeeds on all levels.It's a great popcorn flick. And it's packed to the brim with action.The DVD features a commentary from the director Stephen Sommers, deleted scenes, a few making of featurettes, and a bevy of other special features including trailers and a music only track.If you're a fan of action, definitely recommended.
1	Hahahahahahahahahaha: I loved this movie and this keyboard I'm typing on is kind of whacky so any mistakes are probably not my fault.Back to the movie: it was a lot of fun. Brendan Fraser kept me laughing. The characters were pretty well drawn. And all the expendables were somehow still endearing. John Hannah was standout. Very funny guy. "Bad luck, old mum," and "Im-ho-tep," were probably the funniest lines in the whole movie. The special effects were stunning and the action was pulse pounding.A couple of quibbles with minor spoilers: if the beetles ate Imhotep, "very slowly," in the words of the female lead, then how come they devoured that poor guy in the passageway in like .5 seconds? And how come the Imhotep took the eyes of Burns, who wore glasses? I expected to see the mummy staggering around like Burns did when his glasses wer knocked off.Any way very good. Little language and the violence isn't bloody or too gruesome with the possible exception of the burrowing bugs.
1	better than the1932 classic: the mummy ultimate edition dvd is one of the best films i have on dvd. the mummy is truly spectacular. with huge special effects good actors and acting the mummy never runs out of adrenaline. brendan fraser and rachel weisz are superb as Rick O'Connell and Evelyn the librarian are perfectly fit. one of the best films of the1990's. the mummy packs a wallop!
1	Mummy...the ultimate movie!: I really loved this movie, i remember seeing it the next day after star wars come out and loving the fact it is a new Indiana jones type movie, sure there has been many tries at those type but this movie is dead on, only missing doctor jones. The movie is not scary but a load of fun and a good adventure. if you have the regular dvd then skip this and save your money as it's not enough extras to make it worth it the mummy returns is out on dvd soon so the spotlight on it here is not worth it.but if you don't have the mummy yet on dvd then get this one since it's both widescreen and fullscreen and the extras are nice.
0	Another worthless Remake: Hollywood must think that fans of Horrormovies are Braindead,otherwise they would have choosen to use either the version proposed by Clive Barker or Joe Dante for the Remake of "The Mummy"Instead a mediocre script was choosen,and a less then mediocre actor,Brendan Fraser(George of the Jungle) was hired for the lead role and to top it all of,very bad CGI(Cheap Gimmicky Images? )where used in this worthless Remake! But I guess that's all that is needed to have a Summer Blockbuster?
0	very disappointing: Having grown the love the Richard Jury mysteries, I was bitterly disappointed by this novel. I tried to wade through it but it was so gawd-awful boring that I just gave up.
0	Not worth the cost.: Bought 2 shirts $29.99 did not really think this through for the shipping charges $20 per shirt, 2 shirts came in one box(size of a medium pizza box).The company did offer to take the shipment back but, it was too late, I opened the shirts. After 2 washes, they are not holding up too well, so overall. I would not endorse this company or product.Amazon though, did acknowledge my issue with this shipping transaction as best they could. I hope they will improve for the next buyer.
0	Huge disappointment: I've played all of the CSI games and the three L&O games prior to this one and, man, was I let down by this. It's a huge resource hog - it took almost10 minutes to install the thing and it took even longer to uninstall it. When the installation is complete it automatically sends a registration (to whom and with what information is unknown - a major privacy violation) without giving the opportunity to say no. The game play isn't intuitive at all and doesn't follow the same conventions established in the earlier offerings. The PDA thing is a pain in the [...], there's no right-click functionality, limited options in terms of configuration (cannot play it in other than full screen), and NO INSTRUCTIONS! Not happy at all with this.
0	Poor quality: After first time worn it turned color. It is too thick and cumbersome to wear as a toe ring. Very poor deign.

0	THESE ARE KNOCK OFFS, THEY ARE HORRIBLE: I BUY THESE BLADES FOR MY HUSBAND ABOUT ONCE A MONTH. WE HAVE NEVER HAD AN ISSUE BEFORE. I SEARCHED AND FOUND SOME THAT WERE CHEAPER ON AMAZON THOUGH A WHOLESALER, ALL THE TIME WHOLESALE. THEY WERE17.99+4.59 SHIPPING. HE GOT THEM A WEEK LATER. THE FIST TIME HE USED THEM HE HAD CUTS ALL OVER HIS FACE, HE STILL HAD SHORT HAIRS THAT HAD NOT BEEN SHAVED OFF AS THE BLADE WAS VERY DULL, AND HIS FACE WAS BURNING. ON THE BACK OF THE BLADE THE ORANGE STRIP HAD BEEN WORN OFF JUST FROM ONE SHAVE. THESE ARE DEFINATLY KNOCK OFFS. WE COMPARED THEM FROM ONES WE ORDERED BEFORE AND THEY DO NOT LOOK THE SAME. I USED ONE OF THE BLADES TO SEE IF MY HUSBAND WAS RIGHT, AND IT WAS HORRIBLE. I GOT RASOR BURN AND STILL HAD LITTLE HAIRS THAT WERE NOT REMOVED AS THE BLADE WAS SO DULL. WE WILL NEVER PURCHASE BLADES FROM ALL THE TIME WHOLE SALE AGAIN, OR EVEN AMAZON IF THEY CONTINUE DOING BUSINESS WITH THEM .
0	Pretty sure they are not authentic!: I am currently talking to the people over at Gillette over the concern that this product listed on Amazon may be counterfeit. The razors are not shaving smoothly, they are very very rough and tear up my face. Now when I have purchased this same product from places like cvs, walmart and target; they shave so smoothly and gently. Also the packaging looks off. I will not be buying again from Amazon if they are allowing counterfeit goods on their site.
1	Great!: This item came to me in a timely manner and there was absolutely nothing wrong with this product.
1	La mejor afeitadora del momento: Yo llevo casi 2 años afeitandome con la Fusion Power y afirmo que es la mejor afeitadora del mundo. Yo uso cada cartucho 5 veces, y afeitan bien hasta el ultimo uso.
0	This review is for the R-Rated version: Wicked Sister is an interesting movie starring two half sisters Chelsea and Misty Mundae. Misty plays the bad sister who gets her good sister Chelsea into some bad trouble at school and now they're on the lam. Along the way the meet a crazy woman who wants to play a game with the two. An entertaining movie that is hampered by heavy editing.It's okay, but get the unrated one instead.
0	Bordering on incoherent: As a grdauate student, I feel compelled to write honestly about this book in the hopes that what I'm writing might influence some teacher's decision in the future. Granted, the topic area this book is covering isn't trivial, but in the light of its complex nature it is even more paramount that someone attempting to explain it to those who don't understand it be well-versed in, frankly, English. This book is quite possibly the worst textbook I have ever encountered. The writing is atrocious, the "flow" is like mud, and the explanations make even things that could be simple, dreadfully complex. Avoid it like the plague, there are a lot better options.
1	Infant Fun: My son is14 weeks old. He started playing with this toy at about13 weeks. So far he is in heaven with this toy. When I lay him on the floor to play he loves to bat at the toy to activate it. He loves the lights, and music, and looking at the fish. It is really neat to see him start to learn that if he moves his arm and hits the bowl it will start up again. It is very entertaining for him. I wish there were more toys like this for my infant. Since he can't sit up yet it is really hard to find stuff to occupy him and this is a definate hit with him. When I put him on his stomach it encourages him to lift his head up so he can look at the lights in the bowl. I love this toy!
1	great toy: my son loved it when he was little, and now my other son is playing with he and he seems to love it too!
0	too many negatives: I just got this toy for my six month old daughter and I cannot recommend it. Here is why:The batteries don't last at all (empty after ten days)It is way too heavy, my daughter can already pick it up and if she drops it on her head it will really hurt her.The lights and music come on by the slightest touch or vibration, she does not have to do anything to help her learn (like putting the balls in the middle) - just me walking by will make it come on.
0	Don't Know Yet: My daughter is 61/2 months old. She's been sitting up for at least 2 weeks. She laughs at this toy when I activate the music. She picks up the balls if I hand them to her. Otherwise, she is NOT interested. Things may change.....but so far, I like this more than she does.
1	Fantastic addition for any road warrior: I run my own insurance business and was always inundated by a sea of paperwork. This little scanner fits into my BJC-85 printer and serves double duty - I can scan and then print with the same machine. Genius! I would have liked the ability to scan documents into a pdf format, but you can't have everything. This little scanner is the main reason I will not upgrade my BJC-85, as it is not compatible with later models.
0	I have had more fun with a bag of sharp glass.: The creators of this game wasted great graphics on a game with not enough depth. The only time I had fun playing this is when I paused it and took a nap and had a dream about Pamela Anderson. There weren't any guns and the game was way to hard.
1	Worth it: My daughter got this toy last Christmas when she was 2. She liked it, but wasn't totally enthused. Now at 3, she is more into it & we tried another cartridge (Science- Living Things). I am a middle school science teacher & I was really impressed with this cartridge! My son is15 mos & he also really loves Kasey, but I have to cover the on/off button & play with him. My daugher is able to play with Kasey independently. The only thing that I really don't like about the toy is the screen - it really needs its own light source. It is too dark & hard to see sometimes, esp. if you aren't right in front of it in a bright room. This is tough when you are playing with a child who may a need a little help - it is hard for you both to see. Kasey the Kinderbot is really cute & teaches a lot. It is very different from the Leap Pad type toys, so it is still worth getting even if you have one of those already.
1	Best toy I ever purchased: Kasey the Kinderbot is truly the best toy I ever purchased! I have a 3 year old girl and an 8 year old boy and both love it. It really does make learning fun for both of them. Both have used it constantly. Luckily, my son is gone to school all day.I had the 2XL Robot as a kid and this is basically the same thing but even better. Better get yours sooner rather than later. This toy will most likely be the HOT toy for this Christmas season.
1	My 3 year old LOVES his KASEY!!!!: And so do I. It has a volume control on it to boot!This is the PERFECT educational toy to hold my little mans attention while I get some housework done. He EVEN knows how to change the learning functions on the back. He LOVES IT and will probably love it for a long time more....when he outgrows it, it will go to his baby brother or sister who is on the way.
0	But is it accurate?: Following is the review I left on another web site: So far I found 2 errors which MS confirmed: page 4, definition of UTP; and, page17, max segment length10base2; these are the errors I caught with my limited knowledge; my faith in the accuracy of the book has been undermined. I find this frustrating because I was looking forward to reading this book; I am now afraid to commit to memory anything I read within it.
1	Lovely Ring: I bought this as a surprise for my daughter--so, I guessed at the size. Boy, was I way off! The shop took it back and sent another with no problems. My daughter loves it!
0	Much Too Expensive: I bought the Fusion manual razor and after using the two included cartridges and then seeing the cost of replacement cartridges, I have tossed my Fusion. Replacement Fusion cartridges are much too expensive and the shave one gets from them simply does not justify this kind of expense. I think the pricing of Fusion cartridges is like that of gasoline: we are being milked of every cent we are willing to part with.Another issue I'm concerned about is that the clamshell packaging is dangerous if it is anything like the packaging used for Mach 3 cartridges. The plastic of the packaging will stab or slice you. It is unsafe for most adults. The government ought to force Gillette to design safer packaging.The main reason for giving this product1 star is the price. I'm not willing to part with $22 to $28 for 8 shaving cartridges.
0	Getting burned: I tried this but it was not working out for me, and had lot of issues. I was getting cuts and burns. The Fusion Proglide Power was ideal for me once I changed. No burns/cuts with Proglide power. (Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Cartridge 8 Count
1	Great price, but still expensive!: While this is the most affordable option for this item I found, it is still quite expensive. Glad to find them here.
1	Razors: Fast and good service. I really appreciate your efforts. Too bad we have to use so many words to put in our review!
0	These are not real Gillette blades!: These blades are counterfeit! I alternated daily between these blades and the identical blades purchased from Walgreens. It took only 3 shaves for the blue strip on these to be worn off, versus 9 shaves with the same blade from Walgreens. Shaves were all in the shower at the same time of day with the same shaving cream. They are just plain fakes. I tried this test with 4 of these blades, and the same result happened every time. They are just plain fake!
0	Seems like knock-offs: not as sharp as the one you buy from duane reade... these will give you cuts and burn.. will not buy again
0	Doing bad business: The product did not show up on time. I tried to email the seller but they never got back to me. I still have no idea if they are going to give me the product. It is just bad business and I am shopping elsewhere.
1	Great for everyday shaving needs: I am quite picky about my razor blades, since my neck can be cut by a razor pretty easily. The Fusion has completely eliminated the problem of my razor nicking my neck. Though there are five blades, the way they are spaced creates dramatically less pressure on your skin. This results in a nick-free, incredibly close shave.In addition to the five-bladed front, a single blade is on the back to allow for fine trimming, like the edges of beards and sideburns.The one downside of this blade is that it tends to do less well if you let a few days' worth of whiskers accumulate; they tend to get caught up in the blades. You can avoid this by shaving every or every other day, or using another razor or trimmer to cut the whiskers short and then use the Fusion to finish them off.For those of use who will be shaving every day though, the Fusion is our blade.
0	Knock-offs!: These are knock-offs. They HURT! The blades aren't well aligned and look different from those in locally bought cartridges.
1	Great deal: These are the same razors you purchase at the store- but for a third less. Even beats costco's pricing. Great deal
0	Knockoff: Aside from the fact that it took two weeks for my order to arrive, once it finally arrived the shirt appeared to be a knockoff. In comparison to another Duofold item I purchased from another seller, this shirt is clearly inferior - not only is the material different but the tag appears to be an iron-on copy with several of the words blacked out. I would never buy from this seller again.
1	high society: This is the first Nero Wolfe novel but not the first Nero Wolfe investigation: Nero and Archie have been together for some years, and some people owe them great debts of gratitude. Like many later stories, this is largely set in Westchester County. There is a definite affinity with P. G. Wodehouse in the mixture of accuracy and escapist fantasy.
0	OK but not great: It's a fairly readable book, but there are quite a few errors.The book is strongly based on the open-the-loop method to find loaded Q, but this method is heavily flawed due to the impedances where the loop is broken being not known.
0	Technical book purchase review.: High Performance Linux Clusters with OSCAR, Rocks, OpenMosix, and MPI (Nutshell Handbooks)The main issue I found is that the purchase was mislead. I was trying to buy a hard copy and they gave me a kindle copy instead without warning!
1	What Makes The Perfect Balaclava?: What makes the perfect balaclava?Ideally it should be elastic, silky smooth, durable and help draw sweat away from your head.Most balaclavas nowadays are made of nylon/acrylic & spandex. Why? It is elastic and remains that way after many uses. Cotton balaclavas will stretch over time and will not retain their elasticity. Silk materials wear down very easily and the material can "ball up" creating those annoying lint balls. The last thing you want against your face are those things.Nylon/acrylic is more durable and feels just as silky smooth as real silk. They help you wick out the sweat and are easy to clean.I've sold balaclavas of different materials and find my customers overwhelmingly prefer the synthetic nylon/acrylic material.
0	Unfortunately, I can not recommend this book...: Although I appreciate the amount of effort required to write a book, I simply can not recommend this one. The book describes unimportant or familiar concepts (like the traditional relational model) in too much detail and new or important concepts (like the Oracle8 object extension syntax) in not enough detail. Many of the diagrams do not appear to relate to the topics being discussed and the examples are too few and far between. I felt that the author used terminology inconsistently or at the very least did not define terms adequately. One might argue that the book is about object-oriented design and not about Oracle `syntax' but if you want to learn about OO check-out books by Booch, Jacobson, Fowler, Rumbaugh, Wirfs-Brock, etc. If you want to learn about Oracle objects try "Oracle8 Design Using UML Object Modeling" by Dorsey et. al.
0	as ugly as it gets: UFC 43 is a joke of an event. There is only one good fight which is the main event. The rest of the card is saved for no namers or fat has-beens such as Kimo and Tank. You can tell that all these guys have very little skill compared to the guys in Pride and sometimes are akin to fat barroom brawlers.Pride FC is the top organization in the world. Sadly, the UFC is far behind.
1	Great for Pilates Classes: I just bought this and used it in my Pilates class for the first time today. My students loved it and I loved it too. It is even great for easy listening while cleaning your house or enjoying a nice afternoon relaxation.
1	My favorite Metheny CD: I listened to this cassette quite a bit back in1985 and then left it for quite a while. Last year (2003), I was amazed to find myself humming "Yolanda, You Learn" and ordered the CD from Amazon. Discovering this music all over again was a joy. To me, this is a CD of uplifting, joyous music made by fantastic musicians offering up some incredible performances.While I have listened to other Metheny releases, nothing has touched me like this one. I would loved to have given this five stars, but the decision to include "Forward March" was a mistake. Fortunately, modern CD players can be programmed to skip tracks. My favorite tracks are "Yolanda, You Learn," "The First Circle," and "Praise." "If I Could" is so beautiful in its simplicity as to bring you to goosebumps and tears.If you are a guitarist or lover of Brazilian music, this CD is a must-have. This release is totally accessible to all lovers of quality music. Highly recommended.
1	Better than first impression!: The MonsterGecko FPS mouse it much better than it looks. Trust me. Even I looked at it at first and thought it was a waste of time. But when I saw it for a great black Friday deal, I picked it up because I was curious. Now I can safely say it's well worth the purchase. The mouse has a good resolution, and the shame is more than a gimmick. It really does feel great to use, games or not! I recommend this product by far!
0	Pass: Novelty item, not real usable: Though very well built, and fun to hold, it's not usable if you're already good at first-person shooters using a mouse -well, not without some serious retraining of your hand and wrist. Especially games heavy on right-click, like Unreal Tournament. It's basically a mouse, only bulkier and less comfortable for extended play.
0	Pointless: If you read the book Jane Eyre you will soon understand the moral concept of what I am saying.When I bought this book I was hoping for a sequal. Instead Emma Tennant turned around all of Brontes work in to something awful and stupid. The worst part is they made Mrs. Fairfax the bad guy in this book. In Jane Eyre she was a good old lady servingthe house. But the way emma Tennant wrote the book she changed nearly half of what everything is supposed to be about.Also they rebuilt Thornfield. Confused? Look at the name. It was a place of terror that held to many memories that haunted people.
1	VERY GOOD!: I bought this item from davewemall recently and it came very quickly. They provided good service and when I got the item, it was exactly the item I wanted. Thanks davewebmall!
0	Pretty but flimsy: This is a very attractive feeder, but the problems I have will keep me from buying another.The slide-clip opens with very little pressure - the squirrels pop it open every third or fourth landing.The wire hanger is close to breaking near the slide-clip.The slide-clip is a marvelous idea, but the application is weak.It is very simple to clean. The side panels lift out so they can be thoroughly scrubbed, and once they are out, the inside of the feeder is easily accessible.
0	Nice looking, but sloppy feeder: At first, I was quite pleased with the feeder. It looks nice and the birds (although restricted to small birds) frequented this feeder often, to the point where I was going through bird seed fairly quickly. However, when I took a closer look, I found most of the bird feed on the ground. When I started watching the birds very closely, I would estimate that for every seed the bird took from the feeder, 3 or 4 seeds would fall to the ground. The feeding holes are fairly large and I expect this contributes to the seed falling out.
1	Value Feeder: Overall a very good item. Holds plenty of seed, however just as others, much of the seed falls to the ground as the birds are feeding. The only good thing there is that once the feeder's empty, the birds fly down to clean up the rest.
1	Topeak Exployer Bike Rack with Spring: It was beyond my expectations. Its a sturdy well constructed rack.The spring on the rack works great! Combine withn the bike bag I purchased its all I need for my cycling experience.
1	Great rack for bigger bikes: After ordering two racks that would not mount properly, I ended up getting this one. My 25" Trek is a huge bike and no other racks would mount at the right angle. This one however, fits like a glove.High quality build, very sturdy and solid. Lots of adjust ability so it'll fit everything from my wifes17.5" frame to my 25".
1	Functional tent: Hey, it is what it is---a tent for the outdoors. I got this for my three month old son who likes to sit outside. My two cats like it, too, and sit in there with him. There is plenty of space for all three.
0	UV rating?: Contrary to the Amazon description, this play tent does not offer any UV protection. Nowhere on the packaging does it mention SPF or UV protection. Misleading and disappointing.
1	Great play tent fits in very small bag: I bought this tent to take to the beach for my 8 month old. The bag it comes in is so small that I thought, at first, that the tent may be too small for my baby. The tent is a great size for an 8 month old and even a little larger. It's very durable and is great for the beach, except that, when your baby isn't in it, you need to put something in it to keep it from blowing away. The assembly was very easy for my husband who has assemble tents before, but I found it a bit more difficult. I would recommend that you face the solid purple tent side in the direction of the sun as the shear sides don't provide shade. The first day we used it on the beach, I ended up draping our beach towels over the side to shield my napping baby from the sun. Overall, I am VERY happy with my purchase of this tent. I think it is value priced, and it fits back into its very small back with ease.
0	Boring, not very educational: My daughter has been playing with the Fisher Price Grand Piano which is by far better than this piano. Fisher Price Grand Piano has the keys light up, has different modes for music, learning (numbers1-8, colors, pitch, and rhythm), also you can play the piano by tapping the individual keys.This particular Rock and Roll Piano doesn't light up, plays different types of musical instruments, but the keys aren't as fun to play. My daughter played it a few times and went straight back to the Grand Piano. Consider buying that one instead.
0	heinous: This is the most terrible, emotionally offensive film ever created. After watching this movie, my eyes began to bulge from my head and limbs began to fall off. Watch this movie if you like the feeling of having your organs ruptured.
0	Horrendous: Anybody that would sit through something so stupid like this movie should be shot. I was not one of the other losers I have what they called taste in movies in this day and age and this is just flat out retarted. Its also a shame i have to give this movie1 star it makes me feel as though i support this shi* in a way. I just wonder if the acting in it could be half as bad as the movie or the plotI wouldnt watch this if i was paid, Wake up America and today's youth
1	Wonderful read aloud book!: I read this book to my11 year old son. Both of us were captivated with Roald Dahl's experiences prior to and during World War II.Though our family has thoroughly enjoyed all of Dahl's fiction, this is the first non-fiction Dahl book we have read. The way he describes the people, places and machinery he encounters is so real and honest. He comes across as an astute observer during the times he describes. I found this book to be entertaining and educational. I only wish he had written more books about the next decades of his life.
0	Dead or didn't work: I spent time installing this - had to remove the CPU cooler and reinstall it... and it completely failed to work! I called Antec and they mentioned a compatibility problem with 965 boards (which I was using) and this PS. Supposedly I had a "fixed" unit though, but it failed to work. Going back to the old PS (an Antec SmartPower) worked without a problem.
0	Not a good fit: The tent seems to be good. But the tunnel does not fit well into the tent. Just comes off too easily when the kids try to crawl through it. Would find a better tent tunnel combination that holds up strong.
0	too narrow: I have worn many Easy Spirit shoes over the years and owned this particular style at least 4 times. Unfortunately this pair was way too narrow! What happened?
1	Best I've Used: I was pleasantly surprised. This is really the best razor I have ever used. I just assumed that having 4 blades was just another gimmick, but it really provides an amazingly smooth and clean shave and minimizes nicks and cuts.
1	Good value for a great product: My older black retreiver has flaky and peeling skin. She had a thyroid condition and we use this shampoo. It really soothes and seems to help.
1	Jewelry clean solution: Use in my ultrasonic unit and makes everything look brand new. I recommend you heat solution in microwave before adding to unit to boost cleaning power on grease/lotion which sticks to prongs.
1	Great read: Overall, easy transaction. The book is very touchy on provoking emotions from the reader. The published stories in the book are very eyeopening and realistic. Sender made the transaction easy to work with.
0	Usual Glacial Paced Novel from James: This is so typical of H. James writing...very, make that incredibly, dense. Wordy beyond belief. At a pace that surely puts me fast asleep after a mere 2 pages. A ridiculous pair of uncaring parents essentially abandon their daughter to whomever comes along. As an amazing coincidence, the divorced parents each take a new spouse only to watch the wife of one have an affair with the husband of the other. If you are really into dialogue that no one has ever spoken in the history of English and willing to devote hours to really obscure language construction, this is the very winner for you.
0	I love classics. I'll never read Henry James again.: It's his style I can't get my arms around...conceptually interesting, but his writing here flows like a gutter clogged with leaves, only occasionally achieving the fluidity I look for in fine writing. I chose it because it was shorter than some of the more famous ones. Life is too short. I'll sell it back.
0	not durable: Several of these came with my crossbow so I used them to sight in and bought Gold Tip brand bolts for hunting. They're a bit brittle/ fragile as compared to the Gold Tip bolts. They were destroyed by target shooting, some had the inserts pull out and left the insert and broadhead inside my target and others snapped off when I pulled them out. It seemed to me like just the force of hitting the layered target was enough to crack the arrow or break the glue loose and they finished breaking when I tried to pull them out.
0	warning about motorola phones: The product has a USB port but it is not compatible with my Motorola phone, the phone says unauthorized power supply and disconnects.Works with ipods but I think the Motorola expects a "smart" usb port it can talk to and this must not be one.
1	Amazing product: This is a cool product, so far I don't have any problems with this. It charges my Iphone, and any other small units. I haven't tried this in a long drive yet but I'll give you guys an update when I drive from NY to TX this summer. Well, so far so good!Cons: The only thing I notice is that you can't really tell if it's "on" since the "ON" button's light is unnoticeable, it is just useless unless you try to wrap your hands around it to dim the area. BUt I still would recommend it to anyone I know!
1	In agreement with others: I would have to echo the sentiments of many of the other reviews. I bought this when my11 month old son started pushing everything he could around the living room. He loves it but it is way too fast for his little legs. Also, it moves around when he is just trying to play with the balls and net because you can't stabilize it. Plus when the balls disappear he gets very disappointed.It's definitely going to help his walking but it's a constant supervision toy.
0	It sucks!: My daughter is a year old. We got the walker a few months ago. My husband put it together, we helped our daughter hold on to the handle and it flew out from under her like a bullet!She would sometimes crawl behind it and push it. But, she got bored with that. Now that she has started walking she doesn't pay any attention to it. We fixed it where she can sit on it and push herself along, but her legs are too short. She threw balls into the basket a couple of times, but she has another toy that she can throw balls in that she likes a lot better.Also, the annoying music comes on so easily. All you have to do is walk near it and it goes off.We're getting her something different soon.
1	My 3 year old still plays with this: My 3 year old loves this toy. It's now an outside toy, but she has consistently played with it since day one. She learned to push with it (watch out for wood floors, it tends to go fast). She loved the balls and the sounds as well. Now it's a ride on toy that she's a little tall for, but she still scoots around on it.We left it outside and that ruined the sound, but for us it was a good thing. ;)
0	Not Safe: I've never written a review on an item, but I will on this one. My daughter is about1 year old and this product is not very good for a baby learning to walk. As soon as she pushed it into a wall and leaned forward the whole thing almost flipped over. Could have caused a serious injury had I not been right there. I don't see how it has such a high rating by other users.
0	Horrible toy...: My daughter received this toy when she was about11 months old and we eventually had to throw it in the garbage!!! Every single time she bumped into the wall or a piece of furniture it would nose dive and she would end up with her belly in the "v" section of the walker flying like superman! I can't tell you how many times the toy flipped over and she was hurt and crying hysterically! I am seriously shocked at how many people love this toy!! Obviously it is top heavy and not very safe for a new walker! My opinion is save your money and try a different push-ride on toy.
0	Not Useful as a Walker for all Children: My child could not use this as a walker. The protruding arms that are used later on for them to ride did not give her enough room to walk in between them. I took it back.
1	cute and durable: this toy:is easy to put togetherdurableeasily (and securely) claps shut to transition to ride-oncolorfulhas cute musici cannot think of anything i dislike about this toy. it even has little area in the front for baby's feet so you can push them.
1	Gamma Good: Gamma's high rise gold 75 is the best ball hopper I've ever owned. I've been playing tennis for over 20 years. Gamma good!
1	Funny Horror!: Another one of those humorous horror movies that you liked as a kid. It's Creature Feature on a sleigh ride. Fun.
1	Fun!!: I bought this tunnel for my daughter for her first birthday, and she has loved it ever since! She has so much fun crawling through the tunnel and hiding in there. It is a great chance for any child to get exercise and to add some fun and excitement to their day!
1	great toy: I just bought this tunnel for my two year old daughter. Her nursery school has the neon see-me connecting tunnel, and she just loves it. They didn't have that one at our local [store], so we bought the 6' Find-Me Play Tunnel. I think this tunnel will last a long time. My kids have already jumped on top of it, and the dog even tried to crawl through. It seems to be quite durable and is not made of cheap plastic like some of the less expensive tunnels. It's definitely worth the extra money.
1	Excellent Lens!: I don't have much to say that hasn't been said before. This is the sharpest lens I own and it has become my "gold standard". The image quality of all of my other lenses get compared to this one.This is also the first lens that I have owned which has exceeded the capabilities of my camera. As I zoom in, my other lenses would lose sharpness before the image would pixelate. With this lens, I was sharp down to the pixel level. This inspired me to upgrade from a 6MP K100DS to a12MP K-r.The images from this lens are extremely lifelike and the colors are superb. I get more "keepers" using the DA 40mm than with any other lens.
0	Disappointing: I think had this book been labelled "romantic erotica" instead of romance, I would have been less disappointed with the story. Because having the characters say 'I love you' a lot doesn't make it a romance (especially when they've known each other for all of a day)! Both Connor and Adam felt very 'flat' to me- there wasn't anything to differentiate them from the surrounding characters, and the surrounding characters weren't painted all that vividly either. It's hard to get into a story like this when you don't care what happens to the characters. The heavy-handed exposition and info dumping was also quite irritating, as was the fetishization of aboriginal people.
1	Rutger Hauer Exemplified: Loved it, typically audacious atrocious and ribald. What's not to like about castles, bows & arrows and mid evil...evil complete with rape, pilliage and plunder; and torture and gore!
0	AWFUL: Just horrible. Good looking guys but that does not make make up for the long periods of boredom.One of the worse movies I have EVER seen.
1	Present for a friend: A friend of mine is a cake decorator and is always looking for new styles and ways to make her creations. I bought this for her birthday and she loved it. She was excited to get a book from Debbie Brown, which she said was the best cake decorator she knew about. So a really big smile on her face was enough for me to realize that I got a good present.
0	doncha think: that this song is better promoted for itself rather than on the strength of PR trickery trying to capitalize on all things web-based?it's a cynical marketing world that tries to sell us its corporate soap wrapped up with a hippy or a punk bow
0	DO NOT BUY IF IT'S SOLD AND SHIPPED BY AMAZON.COM: Amazon sent me a BOOTLEG copy of this album. There was a SCANNED picture as an insert and the cd was a CD-R. There was no back to this case at all.!! They are selling it for full retail price, and sending out bootlegs. Amazon refused to help and told me they will investigate why they are bootleg but that is it..really?? They refused me of a refund as well! Disgusting!
0	Nice thought but too weak: in the age of the overblown Rod Stewart&Clay Aikens trying to Romance a Era gone by with very Sub-Par Results add another victim to the list.Mandy Moore.now Mandy Moore Vocally is closer to Jessica Simpson,&Christina,Monica,Beyonce,but Mandy's material is Lite in the Booty.Her Material ain't no threat to Vocal Light Weights like Brittney,J-Lo,Ashanti&Others.the concept of Her doing this&at Her Age being aware of the Past because lets be real:Most Peeps coming along today are pushed by the Media&other sources as thinking that Old School is Last Summer&this is Offically the Fall now.Mandy doesn't have enough juice to make Her take on these Songs Believable fully.now in any 20 years She might be a bit more Seasoned&She might find that Connie Francis Element She has in Her.stay tunned.
0	Could have been........: With gleeful anticipation I purchased this cd hoping to hear some wonderful reinditions of some excellent songs. Boy, was I dissappointed!There are twelve cuts on this cd, everything from Joan Armatrading to Blondie. Clearly the best cut here is a wonderful cover of John Hiatt's "Have a Little Faith in Me". After that, Carly Simon's "Anticipation" and E.John's "Mona Lisas and Mad Hatters" round out all that is worthy of mention on this cd. Skip everything else. Besides a poor selection of songs and an even poorer performance, there is a feeling of being rushed through the music presented here. This just destroys any connection with the songs. A little less pace would have given more of a feel for the songs here. The quintiessential cover cd of the year is Michael McDonald's "Motown", this could have been in that league. But it isn't, skip it and wait for the next effort.
0	Not great: I agree with an earlier review in that the first three songs are not good and they sound the same. The rest is okay but not great. She definitely has a very good voice and could probably come out with an amazing cd someday, but this is not it. Some of the covers were pleasant to listen to but not one of them touched anywhere near the realm of the original singer's version. I would wait and buy a used copy if you're thinking of buying it.
0	Disappointing....: I've been a fan of Mandy Moore from the beginning, but that was way back in 2000. I was hoping that she would have evolved a little bit more being that it is 2007. This cd was not entirely a waste of money, but there were only 2 or 3 songs worth listening to more than once.
1	Yey!: Ummmm You don't have to be an adult to like these songs. In fact that was what I was afraid of when many posted the clips of her new songs on her website. They sounded old... But listening to the whole song is a different story, they have jazzed up the songs a bit with some new souding stuf and it's Great!. Hard Core Mandy Fans(like me) will love it! It's not the buggle gummy pop sound she had with her first album, nor is it the middle eastern kindo f sound from her last one, it's something new and it is awesome! She didn't write any of the songs, but she makes them her own. If you like mandy at all, then you should get this album!
0	Sub Zero's worst role ever (LOGO) SMK: How could Ed Boon do this to my favorite MK character Sub Zero. What a discrace to the MK series.Sucky graphics,sucky moves, and is very complicated.Trust me don't even try this game ever.If you would like to see more of my reviews look for my logo which is SMK at the top or bottom of the review.OUT!(LOGO)SMK
1	Gets the job done.: This drying rack gets the job done. Sometimes the plastic pieces at the end of the legs come off, but no biggie. You can just pop'em right back on.If you need a drying rack for 2 people (or maybe eve three) this is a good choice.
0	tough to read: The author (translator?) ignores the standard use of quotation marks. This makes it extremely difficult to follow conversations in the book. So I was completely distracted from the actual content of the book.
0	tedious run-on sentences; shallow characters: I'm sure Saramago's Nobel Prize was not based on this work. Not one person in my book group was able to finish this book because of the tedious, run-on sentences (the first chapter is all one sentence), and characters too shallow to care about plodding further. The initial premise was interesting -- how one word could change the entire perspective of historical events -- but failed to deliver.
1	Great: Fantastic game but the controles are preset and can not be reconfigured.I am used to configuring the controles a certain way and could not get used to this setup.I guess it is like the old saying ( You can't teach an old dog new tricks )I am a gamer and this is the first time I have seen this.Hope this is not the way of the future in games.But SIERRA comes up with a lot of weird stuff.
0	Not Compatible with windows 7: I gave one star because i could not play game.Im glad i only paid $6.95.Thair is a way to get the game to play on windows 7,you have to set you boot advanced options to1 core every time you want to play game.
1	You go boy!: I know it's mostly just covers, but that's what makes it good! Harlemm takes the classics and makes them his own. His voice is amazing and I just love listening to him. He may be short and bald, but he's adorable none the less. When are you going on tour?!?!?
0	Hated It!!!!: I can't believe how bad this sounds. There are a lot better singers that are just starting out. I wouldn't recommend this cd!
1	Baby loves it, so do I!: This is a wonderful item. My son loves to try and catch the fish as they are moving around. The music and sounds will lull him to sleep in no time at all.
0	Too Loud: I recently had to replace my Peaceful Planet Aquarium with the Ocean Wonders Aquarium. I am not pleased with the Ocean Wonders, it is obnoxiously loud, there is nothing "peaceful" or "aquatic" about the aquarium. Needless to say I am returning the Ocean Wonders and purchasing another Peaceful Planet off of Ebay.
0	Not my son's favorite: My friends recommended this product, but we had a bad experience with it. First of all, the bubble setting makes a rather loud noise and my son had trouble falling asleep. Second, and the most painful, once my son learned to roll over and scoot around, he kept hitting the bottom of the toy with his head and needless to say was getting really upset about it. We kept it in his crib for about 3 weeks and now it's stored in the closet. It was not the best investment for us.
0	WILL NEVER PURCHASE USED AGAIN: I have been searching for a fishbowl crib toy for my daughter for a while now. I came across this particular one, and the seller100% GUARANTEED my satisfaction! BULL! Seller claimed that all toys were tested prior to shipping, guess they forgot this one?? The entire right side has no working bubbles, the big fish in the middle does not move at all. Seller also claimed there were no scratches or marks, yet theres a scratch on the bottom, and what looks like yellow and pink marker on it. I am so disappointed its unreal!!!
1	Works wonders when putting your child to sleep!: The Ocean Wonders Aquarium was one of the last items I registered for but is by far, one of the best presents we have received for our newborn son. My husband and I used it from the first day our son was born and at two months of age, he still falls asleep to this music. For a newborn, the Ocean Wonders Aquarium is much better then any mobile as kids do not follow the moving objects until they are at least couple of weeks old but they do respond to sounds. The music is very soothing and will calm a crying baby in minutes. The downside -15 mins of playing might not be enough so pressing the play button several times can be a pain expecially at night if you have a separate baby room. A remote control would be a great improvement.
0	boring and stupid, get a mobile: this toy is another attempt by toymakers to teach infants to be content alone in their cribs. anyone who still buys into the idea that babies will and should fall asleep alone should get a full grown dog, not have a baby. this toy is so pathetic that it can only grasp for the attention of a very young babies, my four month old was bored with it immediately. do yourself and your baby a favor. rock, nurse and sing your baby to sleep yourself. if you want a crib toy get your baby a mobile or 2. they are much more interesting for the baby.
1	Won't Travel Without It: Our son is 8 months old and we've been using the Ocean Wonders Aquarium in his crib since he was about 2 or 3 months old. He has grown to expect the same song every time he goes in for a nap or to bed for the night. There are three settings on it, one is just music, the next is music and lights (this is the setting we use), and the 3rd is music, lights, and bubbles(vibrations). Now when our son wakes in the middle of the night, he reaches up and turns his music on himself and puts himself back to sleep! When we are away from home and we bring the aquarium, it gives him a touch of home and soothes him to sleep. I recommend it often to my friends who are expecting.
1	The best bedtime toy: We first learned about this toy when our baby was in the hospital. We attached it to his crib and he loved it. He loved it so much that we went and got one for him. Whenever he is upset we just have to turn it on and he calms right down. It has different settings so they either have something to see, listen to or both. It is really great for a young baby.I do not think that any nursery should be without this toy.
1	Don't go home from the hospital without it!: This was the one thing that would soothe our son when we brought him home from the hospital. He is 3 months old now and sleeping through the night. When he wakes up he starts to kick and swing his arms and he accidentally turns the aquarium on. He falls right back to sleep! The aquarium will only stay on for 5 minutes. This was not long enough when he was a newborn. I would have to stay in the room for 5 minutes to turn it back on. He likes the ocean sounds better than the music and the louder the better.
0	has no water after being in the closet for 2 years.: My 3 year old son played with this all the time till he got to be a year old then i put it in the closet for a while till i had my 2nd son and just toke it out and now it has no water inside and the fish dont move either. Is there some where i can take it to get a replacement?
1	Perfect for Bed Time!!!: The best thing about this crib toy is the volume control. My 3-month old is content to lay there by herself just looking at the lights (only at night time though). Great for when she is semi-sleepy, following the lights knocks her out.
1	This makes your bedtime routine easy!: I have used this aquarium in my daughter's crib since she was two months old. She is now10 months and still loves it! More importantly, when we lay her down and press it on, the music signals to her that it is time for bed. She willingly rolls over to look at it and eventually falls asleep. She used to press it on herself in the middle of the night to go back to sleep(when her crib was lower and the aquarium was more accessible). I would reccommend this soothing toy to anyone and suggest to start using it early on. The only modifications I would make would be a remote control for parents to turn it on without entering the room(it only goes for 7 minutes) and maybe longer straps so that when the crib is lowered the baby can still reach it.
1	Great Entertainment: We bought this for my 2 month old daughter because she loves my parents fish tank. At first she wasn't all that intested in it, but now she loves it. At 4 months she turns it on all by herself with her feet. It has several different music/sounds to choose from. It was well worth the investment.
0	who picked the music...???: we had bought the previous model of this crib toy for our older son, but some of the moving parts had frozen over time in storage, so we decided to replace it since he loved it so much. that version had happy, cheerful nursery songs. the new version plays an almost eerie, creepy, surreal-type music that actually made my youngest son cry! it's a good thing the new model comes with a silent mode (bubble sounds) or we would've returned it.visually, the toy is mesmerizing and my son likes it as long as we don't play the music.
1	The music stops too soon!!!: I cannot compare it to anything else since we bought it for our first child. She LOVES to watch the fish move and she tries to grab things. I put her in her crib when I am folding her clothes etc. The problem is that I am constantly running back and forth to turn the music back on!!! It ends too soon and that is what she loves! Other than that, we do like it, it keeps her entertained.
1	Put baby to sleep fast: I got this when my son was four months old and he is now14 months old and still uses it to go sleep. He loves to "talk" to the fish and every night. He loves to push the buttons all the time to make it go. When he was younger the music on this was the only thing that calmed him down. It is very durable as my two year has unhook it and it fell on the floor and it still works fine. I would recommend this to everyone,the money is well worh it, and I know he will be using this for several more years as he loves this still.
1	My daughter has loved it since she was a newborn: I recieved this at my baby shower. My daughter has loved it since the day I brought her home from the hospital. She listens to it every night when she goes to bed. She would always smile when i would turn it on when she was just a few weeks old, even if she was sleeping. Now she is 9 months old and still loves it. It is easy fopr her to turn on and make the little star fish move. She will sit and pay with it for quite some time
0	5 minutes??: I bought this item thinking that it would be a wonderful thing to have in my son's crib to help him fall asleep. It takes more than 5-10 minutes though for him to in fact fall asleep. So when it turns off he just starts to cry because he hasn't figured out how to turn it on again. Also just the fact that it has to be constantly turned on defeats the purpose because it just keeps my son awake. It's cute but there have been better sleep aids in the past that are not on the market any more.
1	get TWO!: This was the BEST thing we got for a baby shower gift. The motor gave out after being played over and Over and OVER and **OVER** again every night for 5 years. He wanted a replacement one but we finally convinced him it was for babies and he was too grown up for it. As another reviewer said, it would be better if it played longer - our son would just be drifting off and it would shut off, then he would pop back awake & start it over again.
1	What would we do without it??!!: This is the greatest thing!! We use it every night to put our12 week old daughter to bed after her lullaby. She goes into her crib wide awake but this is so calming and soothing to her that 9 times out of10 she falls asleep within 5 minutes. The variety of settings is great too - we use the bubbles (and lights and music) if she's really awake and the lights and music only if she's already a bit sleepy. It is truly wonderful! We traveled with it as well and it really held up, in checked baggage on the airlines through three connections each way. If I were going to change anything it would be to make the volume go even a bit lower, but this is very minor. Overall we love it and would be lost without it! I keep spare batteries on hand at all times!
0	An awful textbook!: This was one of the worst textbooks I've ever read. It drones on in excruciating detail for pages before finally stating the main point or idea. People don't think that way. State what you're talking about and then give the supporting details and examples. Not the other way around. It is a very frustrating read. I had to reference other resources in order understand the theories and concepts presented in this book.
0	Waste of money: This book is not cram at all. Not even detail to cover up the exam. I think only good as extra reference for studying. It is waste of money.
1	GREAT REFERENCE BOOK! GLAD I HAD IT!: I had a pediatrician that wasn't much help on the breastfeeding issue. I didn't know many people who had breastfed and I picked up this book at the store. It was absolutely invaluable to me and I referenced it many times. I now have a healthy1 year old daughter and I attribute that robust health to giving her the right start in life. I was able to continue nursing her right up to her1st birthday and I don't think I could have done it without this book.
1	Another Great Epic from Mr. Vidal: I just love the Narratives of Empire books from Mr. Vidal. This is the first book of these that I bought and fell in love with the story. Since then I have purchased the other books in the series and am just about finished with Empire and will be re-reading Hollywood next. For me I love the excursion to Hollywood of the silent era which I have done some reading on so much of what Mr. Vidal writes of I have read of before. It does help if you have a grasp not only of politics of the early part of the last century and of early Hollywood. Still if you have never heard of Warren G. Harding or D W Griffith you will still love the book because of Mr. Vidal's wonderful writing. His writing is so descriptive that you can see the places he writes about and his humor is such a treat. I would highly recommend these books to anyone and everyone.
0	Feels disconnected: Although my kids (5, 4, and 2) enjoy the pictures, the storyline felt disconnected/lacked smooth transitions. I had to explain a lot of what was going on to my kids rather than the story telling itself as most children's books do.
0	Avoid buying this product!: I read the user review somewhere else and I ignored them. What a fool I was. This product did not pick up any signal from my TV or Radio. Avoid buying this product. I had it return within 3 days of trying.Trust me. DO NOT buy this product (Sennheiser R40).
0	Esta versión está recortada: La novela es genial, inmortal, imperecedera. Pero esta versión que vende Amazon es un versión recortada e incompleta, casi la mitad de la novela que autorizó Tolstoi. No sé si es la misma versión que edita en papel la editorial Juventud que es la mitad de la novela completa. Fue un chasco para mí descubrirlo, pues ya la tenía en papel en la edición de Planeta con la traducción de Alcántara y Laín Entralgo e introducción de Eduardo Mendoza y al compararlas me di cuenta. Espero que Amazon ponga a la venta esta novela en la versión completa, preferiblemente en la traducción de Lydia Kuper. Pr eso mi valoración es por esta versión en concreto no a la novela en sí.
1	Wonderful read: I started this book because my son is a rower and I'd hoped to learn a bit more about the techniques and the mindset of rowers. Sara Hall provides that, but so much more. Her account of coming to grips with an abusive relationship is delicate and sensitive. Many middle-class women can see themselves caught in a subtle dance with a domineering, controlling, cagey husband. The strength she finds through rowing and her connection to community is beautifully portrayed. I encourage every woman to read it.
1	Incredible: One of the best games ever to play against your friends. A top five game as far as the n64 was concerned. Its a game hat changes the football rules slightly while still holding the integrity of what the sport is. Just incredible as far as the fun factor goes. Definately a game that makes pulling the n64 out of the closet. Five stars all the way!
1	First-rate film: Not being an "action" movie buff, I was somewhat surprised that I was hooked on this film. Everything about it was superb. Well acted, very well directed and kept my interest right up to the final credits. The description of this film as a gay "Bonnie and Clyde" was apt, although I still look forward to the day when we don't have to use "gay" to describe a film as anything other than what it is, a great film.
0	not easy set-up: The instructions say that it is easy set-up. However, it is very difficult to get the poles into the correct place to set the tent up. Without forcing too much, the tent tore.
1	A Real Hit with Our18-month old Grandson: I got this for our18-month old grandson for Christmas and this was just the thing for him to satisfy his craving to climb in, around, and behind things! It was larger than I expected, big enough for both of us to sit in, which he loved. Its only been up two days but it seems durable because in the beginning he seemed to try batting it around to test it out and it held up admirably. The colors are bright and it seems well made. I feel certain that he'll play in it often.
0	Not impressed: I was disappointed in the tent part of this set. It's flimsy, and the corners slide/collapse in too easily making the floor space much smaller. The tunnel part is great, though. I much prefer the pop-up house that my kids have.
0	so so good: Works most of the time, But Id say every1 out of 5 staples didnt not come even close to sinking into the wood. We spent a lot of time with a hammer and a punch going back over each staple making sure it was flushed. very time consuming.
0	not received yet: article not received yet, not know the causes , but i will be grateful if you send any information about that .
1	Easy, delicious and nutritous: Easy to make, great tasting, and excellent nutritional value. I add chrushed ice to give it a frosty shake texture.
1	Loose Weight the Healthy way: I lost almost 20 pounds just by taking herbalife nothing really worked for me, i was so desperate didn't know what to do...I even try diet pills over the counter but i always got a side effect by taking them. I'm still loosing weight from 250 pounds to160 pounds (oh yeah baby), Like the song says I'M BRINGING SEXY BACK YEAH! Make sure to use formula1 shake mix and 3 protein, just replace a meal if you don't eat breakfast like me drink the shake every morning ....2 scoops of shake mix and1 scoop of proteinand you'll see results NOT KIDDING!
0	Hmm...: Ok... I seldom write reviews so here it goes.I have never been on a wheight-loss shake diet and was very skeptical about this product. It is true that after eating it you feel satisfied and the taste is not that bad when you blend it with fresh fruits, but beware! if you leave the shake sitting for too long it tastes gross! I made too much once and had to put the remainder in the fridge to drink later. When I went back to my shake it tasted really bad! I'm going to finish up this container and then switch to Kirkland brand wight-loss shakes (the chocolate one is delicious by the way). I hope it really works out for other people, but sadly this product just wasn't for me.
0	FAKE PRODUCT!!!!: This is not a real product from Herbalife, that's why its cheap. It's fake and won't buy it again. I recommend to purchase Herbalife products only from reliable distributors not online. Most products that are sold online already expired. I will report this to Herbalife!
1	VERY GOOD: It was more than an anime, it got something else something, this perpective, it was more than it, the ending was explendid, when they way part of your life is maravillous talk, and all, and make you think, have your life been as wonderful, and also make me think when i grow up, isn't betaiful.
0	Clueless!!: This movie will leave you staring dumbfounded at your screen in disbelief - that you actually sat through 88 minutes of this appalling excuse for entertainment. The characters were as superficial as the plot was non-existent. A couple of cuss words and Sienna Guillory's breasts were thrown in to give it an R rating but truthfully the DVD box should have carried a government health warning. Whatever you do DO NOT buy this movie. Don't even waste the time or money renting it. Alicia Silverstone and Joe Anderson fail to explore their relationship in any dimension whatsoever, and resort to repeated meant-to-be passionate clinches because they literally have nothing to say to each other. And that's it!
0	a beautiful set, but what's the point if the story is nonexistant?: A pointless film that's trying to be as mysterious and mystical as possible and winds up being nothing but boring. Watching the film, there's a sense that there will be some big revelation, something in the script that will make the movie tie together, but that something never appears. In fact, the ending is even more ambiguous than the rest of the film. This movie is nothing but an exercise to show Alicia Silverstone in different stages of undress, and even those scenes aren't very revealing. The entire movie winds up being one bad mind game, or maybe a good one (depending on how you look at it; after all, the game is to get you to watch the movie). The scenery and photography are pretty good but do not make the film redeemable by any means.
1	great cd, speedy delivery: This cd is exactly what I hoped it would be. I play it while I'm cooking or entertaining because it is perfect background music. It makes me want a fondue pot and a set of bongos. Oh,wait, I have bongos already! Anyway, for someone ready to explore latin jazz this is a perfect intro. For those already into latin jazz, Cal Tjader is a must-have. I plan on expanding my collection of his music.
0	A Very Difficult Book from which to Learn HTML: I have now struggled with this book for many hours, and I am still in ignorance of such basic things as "where is white space allowed in HTML," "when is it case-sensitive, if ever," and "when are double quotes required and when not." This book may or may not be a good reference -- I can't tell -- but if you are trying to get started, it is not the right book.
1	Excellent Content: While this book was written by a number of authors all seemed to have made it easy for me to understand what they were writing. Hey, if they can explain to me what's up in the world of HTML, anyone can learn it and this is the book to do it with.
0	Travel Converter: The Converter appears to be fine, except that it only came with the larger plugs used in northern Europe, not the smaller plugs used in southern Europe.
1	Brilliant collection.: This double disc anthology does a wonderful job of spanning Be Bop Deluxe's collected works. The strongest cuts, and the majority of the collection, come from Sunburst Finish, Modern Music, and Futurama(now out of print). The wonderful live album, Live in the Air Age(also out of print), is represented by only two cuts. There are four from the generally weak Axe Victim and a handful from their inconsistent swan song Drastic Plastic. There are also a few rarities tossed in as an added bonus. Bill Nelson's creativity, musicianship(he is a sorely underated guitarist), and songwriting are truly outstanding. This collection is highly recommended...Simon
0	The Ashen Thief: I got dissapointed with this book. the ashen knight was a very good book centered in the knighthood, but in this one they lost that focus, the furores chapter shouldn't be in a book about thiefs, should be more in an Ashen Anarchist.The first part about the medieval underworld is good, but they screw up the rest of the book with the furores section.
0	I can make it better!: I recently purchased a DD50 from ebay - and it was about what I expected. Yamaha make generally good trusty products - but this kit has the same basic flaw as all electronic druma I have tried - that is - the pads do not pick up light strokes - and also don't respond to heavy hits. In other words they don't react anything like real drums.Ok this is a very cheap unit so you get what you pay for right? - well actually - I did design and market electronic drums (analogue type) back in the eighties - and I spent a long time working on this "response" thing - eventually getting very impressive results.So when I got the DD50 recently I immediately set about improving things - and I have devised a fairly simple way of improving the response drastically with a bit of add-on circuitry.If you are interested please email me. mickwest1@hotmail.com
1	Ella sings: I think this is a very good album, but not Ella's best work. Mostly she sticks very close to the melody and words only infrequently adding her own touches, flourishes - style.
0	Had meant to get a 3 USB cord: When I got the procut, saw I had made a mistake, had wanted a 3 USB cable, but these were so cheap, that I could not send them back, may never use them, but the cost was that good of a bargain.
1	Excellent: This product is an amazing price for the quality it produces. As well as an incredible saving price which is extremely low for such a cable. Great delivery, arrived in just 3 days of ordering the product. To recap; amazing product, amazing price, amazing delivery. All in all great service and speed. Thank you ELMENOS for this product.
1	A solid anime title: This anime is a very nice one that is pretty good for its time. The characters are easy to adapt to and some of the moments are very hilarious. The only thing I didnt really aprove of were the tanks. With a name like Tank Police, you'd expect there to be some really cool tank designs, but the action made up for it. The action is very intense and exciting. Seeing a tank jump on to the wing of a plane was so cool. I just wish U.S. Manga would put more thought into the subtitles. The subtitles were so small and hard to read. That aside, I really like this title and I will propably buy the DVD.
1	the best album ive heard in a while: excellent combination of electronic, jazz, and hip-hop with dark musical elements. my favorite is sanity requiem, but could have done with out the john walker track.
0	Disapointing: The book does not focus on the "Scientific and technical" side (only1/3 of the chapters). Maybe that is why the subtitle has disappeared from the cover. Chapters1-9 and 21-24 are generalities about XML and XML-aware applications. These would have been much clearer if the authors omitted to present all these useless options such as PUBLIC identifiers. Chapters10,11 and annex A paraphrase the MathML specifications. The MathML specs, freely downloadable online, are unusually clear themselves so the book does not bring much. I would have liked a word about the XSIL format, an index for the CD, and a correct table of content. I understand that if the authors had taken the time to write a well focused and pedagogical text, it would have been obsolete before publishing. Yet I am still looking for a book on XML for scientists.
1	All Things Ocean: Great story, full of suspense. The surprises will keep you glued to your seat from the beginning to the end. You practically are in the water with the actors. Great movie.
1	Awsome....but....: This is definaately one of the best DVD's around. The options are incredible and both versions are awsome. The only problem I had with the DVD is the fact that it seems like the sound transfer was unbalanced. the dialoug seemed too quiet at parts and i had to constantly lower and raise the levels. otherwise, this is a must have for any movie fan.
0	Lenticular Rip off Do not get OUT FOXED: This is a disgrace Lenticular means a different box cover. this is the first and only version of the movie. Get the 5 star collection.The same this for all the 6-5-07 fox releases. The Dummies at fox did not even notice that on predator is DTS but the new fancy cover say D.D.
0	"The Abyss" Single Disc Edition--Misleading Advertising !!!: Just want to make you all aware that the single disc edition for the DVD THE ABYSS has misleading sound options.The back of the disc jacket states that English 5.1 sound is available.When you engage the menus only English or French surround sound are available.I blew my stack when I noticed this and now I am stuck with an inferior product.
0	The first song is truncated: "Opinion # 33" is really a 5 minute 5 second long song. The 3:24 song that Amazon has is truncated. Amazon should fix this.
1	Angels on my Kindle - Amazon experience: Our pastor was doing a series of sermons based on this book. We were not required to purchase the book. I am so glad I did. The book contained more information about angels than I had ever expected. The content was based on Holy Scripture (The Bible) and cited references. Reading this book inspired me to read more books on angels. This was the first book I had read written by Billy Graham. I had no idea what a great author he was. I have since ordered other books by Billy Graham and am pleased with them all.
1	Excellent Book: Billy Graham really brings home the reality of angels in this book and how they are not some imaginary beings, but mighty warriors used by God for His purposes.
0	Power Jacked: I bought it in January 2004 and the power jack went bad in January 2006. I bought a laptopp on the cheap end, knowing that it would either break or be outdated in a couple of years, and here I am, just as predicted.I have to call Kenmore, now. My two year old refrigerator just stop refrigerating. Ah, the age of great quality and service! (Yes, Mr. Steve. I am sorry to here about your broken equipment, Mr. Steve. I'm sorry, but it seems I can not help you. Please hold.)
1	fresh, independent research lifts a curtain of secrecy: My Democrat friend begged me to read one chapter, 'just this one chapter' she said. I was bitten by the information, by Mr. Umile's straight-forward writing style and read the entire book.His voice is fresh, he's a political independent who tracked down incredible information on Mr. Bush, his family and regime; how can I ignore the facts. Just the facts.Read this and weep my fellow Republicans.
0	booooo!: wow this has got to be the worst game i have ever played. I mean really who wants to go around and deliver papers for a video game when they could be on quests to save the world. instead of quests to get a good tip.
1	You're missing alot by overlooking this album!: Let's put it this way, words are not enough to describe how great this album truly is. A collection of songs filled with hope, love and "Positivity"! Get It!
0	Radio ratios: 21/2This quite abruptly moves between engaging fused funk reminiscent of Jamiroquai, and schmaltzy light jazz reminiscent of your local waiting room, unfortunately focusing a majority on the latter in vein crossover attempts when it is apparent where the talent lies. The clue as for which tracks to avoid? Pretty much anything with vocals-Mcdonalds theme and scats notwithstanding.
0	This book is garbage!: Do not waste your money ! Instead of bying this junk, look for other publishers. A good recommendation would be the Sybex's titles: WOSA I and WOSA II separetely. After failing twice, I bought the Sybex books and passed after a fast read.
0	WA I & II for dummies written by dummies!: I have to agree with the past couple of recent postings! THIS BOOK WILL IN NO WAY PREPARE YOU TO PASS THE EXAMS! Trump one up for Bill and his gang at Redmond for taking our money and laughing all the way to the bank. Save your money and look elsewhere!
0	Should be titled 'A Brief Intro to MS Windows': Good news: the book has great style, format and layout. Bad news: content. I waited until I passed my WinArch exams before I could objectively review this book. This book doesn't 'offer complete preparation for taking and passing MCSD exams 70-160 and 70-161' like the blurb on the book cover states. I complained to MS Press and MCP regarding this statement and a rep from MCP.com admitted (via email) that 'no one source of reference is sufficient to pass the exam'. Too bad MSPress didn't consult MCP (or that person) before designing the book cover. If you are new to programming then you will learn a lot about Windows by reading this book BUT you won't be able to pass the exams! I'm writing to MS Press to request a refund. I suggest everyone who has purchased this book do the same.
0	Good overview maybe, but for passing tests, NO WAY!: I took and passed both WinArch1 & 2 and this book was NO HELP! Don't waste your time with this book unless you are new to Windows Development. I covered more of what was on WinArch preparing for the VB5 Exam than reading this book. The best preparation by far is still the MSDN Library and Transcender as a guide to what to read. I wish MS would support the MCSD program as much as they support MCSE.
0	Begginer content written for an expert: This has begginer level content, although is too complex for any begginer. Only purchase this book if you already know C and Perl, and have no knowledge of CGI.There are much better simple free tutorials online that could describe the basis of CGI.
1	The holy one is dethroned: God Dethroned's vocals can sometimes lack in quality, but their amzing riffs make up for any lost. This double-disc offers many quality black/death metal songs. Warkult is the song that i get hooked on the most. I suggest listening to them on the metal blade site before you buy it, just incase it isn't what you expected.
0	Boring in the extreme: I have persisted for far too long with this dreary, long winded novel and have decided to stop torturing myself in this worthless effort, and closed the book once and for all on page 460 of 896.I still do so reluctantly, as I cannot remember a book so bad that I could not finish it, by one means or another, either by 'skimming' or jumping ahead.For my 'two cents' worth, don't waste your time, unless you have lots and lots to spare and don't mind meandering around with Dorothea (and the provincials) as George Elliot tries to provide a 'study' of Provincial life.In fairness to others, perhaps if it is approached and read as a 'study', it could be bearable, perhaps even an interesting one - I feel sorry for any schoolchild who had this as a set-book!
0	Huge Disappointment!: Don't remember when I've been so let down, especially given the high level of praise from the reviewers I read before purchasing. Gave up in frustration after completing less than 25% of the book.What a sad collection of wordy FLUFF!
1	As classics go, it's pretty classic: Rarely have I enjoyed a classic with more surprise than Middlemarch. It looks to be an endless and boring morality tale from the plot summary, but reads like a work of high psychological art.The only other writer who has taken me so convincingly inside the thoughts of so many characters is Shakespeare. A strong compliment, but Eliot shows that she had the goods and somehow weaves an epic and beguilingly entertaining tale out of a quite depressing subject and period.I recall not wanting this book to end; for an 800-pager, that's strong praise indeed.They don't write 'em like this anymore!I love this Penguin edition; they've been doing it right for so long that their versions of the classics have all the right, simple touches.Truly great writing makes you feel ennobled for having read it; Middlemarch is most decidedly one of those books.
0	Contrive Hard!: An action-filled yet unsatisfying sequel to the1988 classic. Bruce Willis' engaging performance as the intrepid John McClane is weighed down by a contrived screenplay and lack of memorable villains. Filmmaker Renny Harlin would fare better in the stunt-filled Sylvester Stallone romp "Cliffhanger." Avoid "Die Hard 2" and proceed directly to "Die Hard With a Vengeance" (1995) - a superior follow-up that reunited Willis with original director John McTiernan.
1	Intriguing, Non Stop Reading: Once again, Kimberla Lawson Roby has out done herself! I thoroughly enjoyed this novel and would recommend it to anyone who wants a fiction novel that they CANNOT put down. Ms. Roby makes you want to read while youre sleeping to see the outcome of the story's plot. Although I could not put this book down, I did not want to see it end :( Ms. Roby, keep up the excellent work and please, continue to write fiction novels worth reading. Hope to see you at the African Spectrum Bookstore in Georgia again soon.
0	didn't like it.: I thought this book was slow and boring. The characters wre not well developed and I didn't like the author's writing style. The book was amateurishly written. I do not recommend this book.
1	Such an exciting and interesting book!: I recently finished reading " Casting The First Stone". This book was simply amazing. This was my first time reading a book by Kimberla Lawson Roby. I have seen her name around, but I never read one of her books before. I am a member of the Black Expressions book club, and that is where I ordered this book. Pastor Curtis Black was a trip and half. That man was so low down. I didn't think he could get any lower, but I was wrong. Although I enjoyed the book, it would've been nice to know why Curtis did all that cheating. The book could've used some background information on Curtis. But I must say that Kimberla has captured my interest, and now I'll be on the lookout for more of her books. I don't really have a favorite female author. I can read anything by anyone, be it male or female. But I will certainly be looking out for her. I'm about to let my sister read " Casting The First Stone". And I'll be starting Eric Jermome Dickey's " Liars Game"
1	I couldn't put it down to save my life!: Kim Roby has done it! this book is such a gripping look into one woman's pain filled struggle with her husband that just happens to be a man of the cloth. Man of the Flesh would have been more apporpriate. Tanya Black is an strong, successful woman with a husband that can't be faithful if he tried. This novel spins the web of decit, pain and plenty of get back. The writing is clear and vivid. I could see the emotion laced within the words and I could feel the pain, fear and faith of each character. Kim, you've done it. This is the first of your works that my bookclub has read, but with writing like this, IT WON'T BE THE LAST! The Eye of RA Bookclub.
0	Really?!? I have to have a PH-D and rank in the 90th Percentile in the GRE to learn and run A MVT test?: Honestly QualPro, Some of the stuff I really liked in the book. But as soon as you began to belittle my intelligence by telling me that I need to have a PHD in Stats, and rank in the 90 th percentile in the GRE. Then you lost most of my interest. Why don't you STOP belittling everyone else to sell your process. Lean and Six Sigma are all good. ANY processes that drives continuous improvement (including yours QualPro) is a good thing. Is yours better than everyone else's? who knows? BUT I do know that you don't need to bash ever other CIP process or method to make you feel good. Focus on what you are doing, and if it is good it will be accepted and used, but the fact that you feel like you have to bring down others to build yourself up is pathetic!
0	This Electric Youth Needs a Jolt: The art is the reason to purchase this, if indeed you do. Oeming works in black-and-white Mignola territory here. And occasionally the script spins a nice turn of phrase or matches up effectively with the pretty pictures, in spite of itself.But it tried to hard to be self-consciously arty and poetic. It was like an early Bradbury plot written in late prose, filtered through acid flashbacks -- lyrical but disjointed. I suppose one could argue that it was a success, if it was trying to be dreamlike, but in the light of day a dream still needs to make sense upon interpretation. And this didn't.Can I describe the story? Not so much. A bitter woman, a cuckolded husband, and a neglected daughter. Is she alive, or dead? Is she able to exert influence regardless? Was it a dream? A metaphor? Brought about by a horseshoe to the head? Or ended that way? Let me know if *you* can tell.Look for it in the quarter bin, maybe.
1	This is so kool: This is really great. There are 2 analog sticks and this thing vibrates!! That so kool. If you you don't want it to vibrate, you could turn it off in the option mode of the game. And it is compatable with all PlayStations!
0	Disappointed: I was really disappointed in this purchase. The music was not what I expected. It is not a good choice for a Yoga class. More disappointing is that I can't return it.
0	Dull attempt to ape Hitchcock's style: Highly stylized effort at film noir by Kenneth Branagh, matching the tortuously dull love-affair between his private-eye and Thompson's amnesiac with a cliche-ridden attempt at a genre he either misunderstands completely or must secretly loathe. Derek Jacobi is excellent as usual, and the plot does finally gather some pace, but by this time its a question of making the best of a bad job.
0	Buy the DVD for Branagh's Commentary: I thought the film was way over the top on mood and effects. It was a complete distraction from the characters and plot. I think it could have been much easier to watch if it had been filmed with1/2 the intensity. But the cast is wonderful and Branagh's commentary on the DVD gives great information about film making, the challenges to stage the scenes, and the process of refining the story. I will buy the DVD to get the commentary and will watch that much more than the film.
0	Boring....: Definitly one of their worst albums along with Rubber Soul and the overrated REVOLVER album. Skip it good.
1	Their Best: The Beatles released many fine albums during the 60s, but "Magical Mystery Tour" was their finest. There is not a single weak track on this record. The Beatles never released an album with as many #1 hits as "Magical Mystery," including "Penny Lane," "All You Need Is Love," and "Hello, Goodbye." The other songs aren't bad either. "Strawberry Fields Forever" is the best song John ever wrote, while the title track and "Fool On the Hill" are enough to make an album gold or platinum for another rock group. While the film was a colossal flop, the soundtrack shows psychedlic rock at its best.
1	Magical mystery tour... OH,BUT ITS TRUE!!!!!!!!!: Recently,a poll was taken as to which beatle songs were the best ever, and a bunch of them came from magical mystery tour.Oh,it sure is true,magical mystery tour rules!!!!!
0	Magical Mystery Tour: Horns, flutes, instrumentals and bad vocals. How can one resist? There are lots of descriptives of this album, but "masterpiece" isn't one of them.The title song starts off with potential, but fades quickly, and most of the rest of the record is pretty forgettable, especially Hello Goodbye, and All You Need is Love which sound very outdated.
0	Check the Track Listing: Flying, Blue Jay Way, Your Mother Should Know, Baby You're A Rich Man. Did the group just not try to write a complete album or were they out of ideas? The so-called better tracks, Penny Lane and Strawberry Fiels suffer from Paul's lightweight writing and John's nasally singing - "Straw Berry Fieeeelds For Eveh.."Ugh.Who knows, but it sure doesn't stand up to anything before or after its release. Anyone who rates this 5-stars is simply swept up in the Beatles. They can't be listening to the music.
1	The Best Pop Album Ever Made: Denizens of the Seattle area are long used to seeing me drive around on sunny days, windows open, playing Magical Mystery Tour in my car deck and singing the tunes at the top of my voice. The very apotheosis of Pop. How can you NOT like an album with songs like "Strawberry Fields", "Penny Lane", "I Am The Walrus", "Hello, Goodbye", "Blue Jay Way", and the anthem of the 60's, "All You Need Is Love"? Eh? God Save the British Empire!
1	Great movie about the disaster at Pearl Harbor: I have this movie on VHS and wanted a copy on DVD. This is a great movie.
1	The version: I Really like war movies and this is the definitive version of the attack on Pearl Harbor. The effects are great and the historical background are precise. It's superior to the recent Pearl Harbor film. This is the movie!
1	TORA! TORA! TORA! WINNWR WINNER! WINNER!: Great quality, arrived sooner than expected, great price. NO SHOPPING MALLS OR HUNTING FOR PARKING!!! I could just kick back and watch a favorite.
0	Buyer Beware: When I first purchased this vacuum I was very impressed with the ability it had to suck up pet hair. I have a cat and a dog and it seemed to work wonderfully at getting the hair out of the carpets. However, 9 months later the vacuum has become a piece of junk. It simply blows the dirt it "sucks up" right out the back side of the vacuum and back all over the area just vacuumed. I am not the only person experiencing this, I had recommend the vacuum to a friend that told me the other day he ended up so mad that he threw it out into his yard and went back to his 20 year old Kirby. And his machine is only about 6 months old. Since both of these units were purchased through Amazon, there seems to be no recourse on any type of return warranty coverage. The only thing that sucks with this vacuum is the fact that I paid $90 bucks for it!
1	So far it's great: I researched tons of vacuums before purchasing this one. I wanted the best I could get for around $100. This is the first time I've owned a bagless vacuum and I was a bit concerned that it would be messy to empty it. Turns out not to be a problem. Everything detaches easily. If you were to open it over the garbage and shake it out, then some of the dust will fly around cause of the shaking. I just set it in a plastic bag, open, and lift it up and everything comes out mess free in the bag. The automatic cord rewind thing was not a selling point for me when I purchased it, but now I don't ever want to own a vacuum without it - it's so convenient. I gave it four stars only because it is a little bit heavy, but not too much to be a problem for me.
1	A fantastic vacuum for the price!: I bought this vacuum four months ago and it works great! Easy to use and really seems very powerful. Picks up things from your carpet that you didn't even see. The push-button release for the dirt container makes it very simple to empty. This is an excellent vacuum for the price. I use about a mid-range height setting for my carpets and it works great.
1	Extremely pleased!: I was looking for a new vacuum for my apartment, so I did some research and read a lot of reviews about many different vacuums. After much hemming and hawing over which one would suit me, I decided upon this one and I was pleasantly surprised! This vacuum has really nice suction and it doesn't seem to lose that the longer the vacuuming session runs; it also really fluffs up the carpet. I have a dog and she does shed. This vacuum does a really good job at picking up the hair. I have been able to use the pet attachment tool and that works pretty well. Animal hair is stubborn anyway, so I needed a little patience to suck it all up and get those little hairs that were entwined with the fabric fibers. I am glad that I purchased this vacuum. One caution though, when you use the hose, the main agitator still runs. So, be careful what your vacuum is sitting on or you will have a worn spot on your carpet if you let the vacuum sit in one place for too long.
0	Stopped Working: I wonder if the same people who gave this vacumn high ratings would give the same rating after six months. Mine worked well for about six months and stopped working this past weekend. I had it cleaned out thoroughly and replaced the belt, but the power would not come on. My first thought was that the built-in Thermal Protector shut it down because of overheating. It should then reset itself after 30 minutes. Well...it's been two days....I would think that you would want your vacumn works longer than six months. If so, please consider another product that is not made by Hoover. Good Luck if you decided to give this a try because of other reviews.
0	worked once: i bought this 5 months ago -- it worked just fine out of the box ... the 2nd time i used it, it wouldn't pick up even a dried piece of a leaf, i could only get any pickup using the hose which is a back breaking process ... i've tried every setting on carpet and area rugs ... have finally decided it is a total waste of money. Folks - I so recommend you not purchase this.
0	Updated Feedback: I have updated my feedback for this product because the container cap fall off while I was removing the dust from the container. The part of the plastic connection that holds the cap was broken (opened it only a few times). Although I was able to close the container now, I am afarid to open it the next time.
0	Defective unit features: After about 2-3 months, I had problems with the extension tube's rotating brush head. The brush stopped rotating, meaning that it now simply gets in the way of airflow. And the main body takes two or three passes to get some very easy, lightweight things up. I also agree: it's bad to leave the thing running in one spot because it will friction damage your carpet, which is a bad flaw. So when you use the (badly designed) extension tube, watch out. Another problem: if you run one side of the main floor unit under a narrow rim, i.e. a cabinet, the main vac belt tends to come off. This cleaner needed more testing and was marketed too quickly.
1	economical and efficient: I thought at first that the vacuum was extremely hard to push until I realized that the lowest setting was for smooth floors rather than carpet. Once I adjusted the dial, the vacuum moved much more easily. It has great suction and picks up so much dirt and dog hair from my carpet that I'm embarrassed about my housekeeping. I really like being able to see in the clear cylinder what it's picking up from the floor, and it is very easy to empty the canister. The cord rewinder is excellent. The vacuum's a bit loud, but no more than most that I've had. It's definitely worth the money.
0	Junk: Wife bought this vacuum about a year ago. It has sucked since day1. Hate it. Piece of junk. Smells like burning rubber, no suction, belts burn out constantly (probably why it smells like it is on fire all the time), shoots dust particles into the atmosphere leading to increased global warming (o.k. kidding about the "contributes to global warming"). Wish this vacuum cleaner had never entered into my life. Avoid.
1	Hoover U55607-900 Elite Rewind Bagless Upright: This vacuum works great. It works so much better then expensive ones that I bought.The suction is awesome. It's not to heavy. Would recomend it to anyone who has athritis, because of how you can adjust the handle.
0	Absolute Junk: This vacuum is compete junk. After owning it less than it for a month my wife and I had it into the Hoover service center 4 times. The store technician said, in not so many words, that it was complete junk and they have nothing but problems with them. So when I asked about the warranty that I had officially registered through their website, the manager told me that the company had been restructured and that I should just purchase a better model. So when I ask to return the deffective product and get credit towards a better model, he informed me that the only credit would go towards the standard retail price and since they were already having a holiday sale, the credit he could giive me would not benefit me at all. I would recommend avoiding this model and Hoover's all togethr if possible. Their warranty is worthless and their service centers basically told us that since the product was junk to begin with, there isn't much that they could do for us.
0	A Headache of a Vacuum: The thing burned through belts. One time I replaced 2 belts in one vacuuming session--and yes I installed them properly and they weren't rubbing against anything.My guess is that it's the quality of the belts--or should I say lack of quality.Even after two years, the vacuum, when ran, would fill the house with a hot rubber smell.The tubes were also prone to clogging and I've had to pull it apart numerous times to push dust clogs through so it would work properly.After two years, the vacuum just stopped when the motor burned out. I did us a favor.The cord retractor was neat; at least they got that part right.
1	good product: I've used this hoover for one month and it works pretty well. Easy to use and all the parts work fine. The filters are effective. A little bit stiff and heavy, but I never had a big hoover like this, so it might be normal. It doesn't recline too much. I recommend it. Good deal for the price.
0	Broke after one year: I know that companies design (very cleverly) products to go bad after a certain amount of time, and sure enough, this Hoover did just that after1 year and 9 days. The motor overheated once last month (waited an hour and it reset) and then it just stopped sucking up anything soon thereafter (probably around 20% of what it once was capable of). Now it's time to move on to another brand... (MADE IN CHINA anyone?!)There should be a Class Action set up for us against ALL companies (& their products) with ANY parts made in China. Times have changed.
1	fuzzfree: I have newer carpet in my military housing home. And since it isn't the best of carpets we get alot of fuzz from it, even five months later. Our old vacuum, which was small, just wasn't cutting it so I decided to look for one on Amazon. When the vacuum came my husband and I were both happily suprised at the features. The dirt cup is great with a very clean release and we love the cord rewind feature too. Over all we're very happy with the purchase!
1	Fantastic Vacuum - Hoover: We brought this because of the reviews we read and they were right, it is a great vacuum and it is a bonus that it has a HEPA filter. We recently moved into a new apartment and my husband got very bad sinus in the new apartment, I think they may have had a cat there previously. Although the carpet looked clean I used the new Hoover on it and wow there was so much cat hair and dust it was amazing what it picked up and suddenly my husband no longer had sinus. It is easy to empty, the only down side is it is a bit heavy to push. It was also a great price on Amazon.
0	Wish I'd Read Reviews Before Buying: Purchased this vacuum just after Christmas, wish I'd read the reviews first. I'm 64 so I've had quite a few vacuums and this is the least user friendly one I've ever owned. The only thing good about it is the retractable cord. It doesn't pick up dog hair very well and after emptying, it's a pain to get back together. I'm taking it back to Target.
0	Poor Quality construction: I purchased this for my 7 year old. He is really in to hot Wheels. He is pretty good about being careful with his toys but with an hour of opening this new toy he was taping the doors back on. This product is very low quality. The wheels have fallen off the cars. I would avoid buying this.
1	Creative fun is good fun: This set combined with other sets, provides my son with hours of creative fun. I have found that to be able to build a variety of structures, it takes a total of about 350 pieces. So this was an addition to 2 other different sets already purchased.
1	yoga, meditation, massage music to enjoy while reading: My students love this CD in yoga class and I enjoy it also at home while reading or meditating with a lavendar candle burning. It really is a Healing to listen to.
1	Amazing and insightful: Beth Sipe writes about her exeperiences as a battered woman in this emotionally charged biography. She talks about the years of living with her abuser and raising her children in a home that was never without pain and abuse. She fights the legal system, mental health system, police, and military for support for years, but never gets the help with her situation without challenges.She tries to leave several times and even when she is able to get a restraining order, her husband violates it. Finally she is able to take no more and does something that will forever change her life and the life of her children.This is a must read for anyone working in domestic violence or for those who have lived with abuse and are on the road to recovery.
1	An Underappreciated Capra Classic: I love this movie. All of Frank Capra's films are great, but this is the one I like the most(this and YOU CAN'T TAKE IT WITH YOU). It's a wonderful story of a "woman of the street" trying to put on a good show for her daughter when she comes to visit(and introduce her fiance). It's a touching and funny film and goes sadly unheralded(at least Criterion released in on laserdisc). I often think of it in the same class with the Barbara Stanwyck classic, STELLA DALLAS. A must for any classic film fan, an absolute must.
1	WARREN AND MAY ARE GREAT!!!!!: I love this film, although I have to agree that the print suffers. I wouldn't be that concerned about it if it wasn't for Capra Jr. raving about it as much as he did. Overall his commentary is interesting although somewhat repetitive. "Lady For a Day" is a real classic and should have been on Criterion.
0	Broken!: We bought this as a birthday gift and when it was opened - it was broken inside the box. I am glad I also purchased a strobe light or the kids would have been so disappointed! And, instead of being able to exchange it - you can only return to amazon from this seller and there was no way to conact the seller to have them send us a working one.
0	A broken item was sent: I received a broken item from the seller. This is the first time I received an undesirable product from Amazon and I will think twice to order something in future.I needed that item for a special occation and somehow managed to glue the pieces. I did not return this item to the seller.Krish Mukhopadhyay
0	The reviews are true about the bulb!: Bought it for a small band gig we are gonna have. The package comes really secure and, as usual, amazon has been great with the shipping. The real problem I had was the bulb wasn't turning on THE FIRST TIME I tried it. The rotating ball is working so I figured out I just got a broken bulb. Bought a new bulb (bulb description at the bottom doesn't match the actual bulb you will need). Still wouldn't work. FML for throwing the box right away. Now I have this in my garage, useless
0	UNoriginal!!!: A straight guy who wants to have a female-dominant threesome? Let's see: this has already been done in "Trois" and "Just One Time." Just as those movies stunk, so does this one. This movie could have been called "The Look-alike Film." The main character looked like he could have been Brendan Fraser's fatter brother. The Spanish student was obviously a Penelope Cruz imitation. In fairness, one guy may have been the actual tattooed guy from "Oz," the one on death row.This film says it has "sexual content," but it could have run on non-cable TV. There is no nudity whatsoever. The plot is predictable. I am in shock that a movie whose cover looked so titillating could be such a disappointment. This work really and truly lacked redeeming qualities.
1	cheap price works well: thats all i can say about it. it fits my toyota 96 camry and it seems to be better than my previous gas cap
1	Awesome game: If you like action and great moves, then this is your game. The game is entertaining and definitely worth the money. I would recommend this game to all who love fighting games.
1	not perfect: The lastest chapter is not good. The style is Different with above. Look like other author write it.
1	Good but wordy: It is a good book for you to pass SCBCD. All content focuses on exam objectives. However, I didn't give it 5 stars because it is too wordy. Some people might love the book since it makes them smile. But if your goal is only to pass SCBCD, the wordy content is useless and wastes your time.Anyway, I passed SCBCD with 91% by using this book.

0	Buy the book instead: I know, I know. A book and a video are two different art forms and you shouldn't compare them to each other. But after reading the utterly hilarious book based on this series, the actual video was a disappointment. Slow and boring describe it best. Natually the video can't introduce Root's interior dialogues, so we're left with minimal dialogue. Also, some episodes (in the book with pictures) were apparently edited out of the video. Too bad -they were hilarious. Stick to the printed word on this one if you want hysterically cutting British sarcasm.
0	Comments on Crowd Madness: Was disappointed that so much of the original book was left out in order to focus on investor psychology. MacKay was a master of crowd psychology in its many forms, in addition to investment matters.
1	Informative and interesting - Maybe not for a beginner: I really enjoyed this book. Written in the1950s, is has an interesting view of the1920s through the lens of a post-war intellectual. Giving evenhanded accounts of Wilson, the Roosevelts, Smith, McAdoo, Coolidge, Hoover, and other major players of the period, the author manages to critically analyze the era leading up to the depression without condemning it in broad strokes.Leuchtenburg does a particularly good job of defending Hoover as a capable and intelligent man with little tolerance for playing politics and an incredibly poorly dealt hand dealt to him. He is also critical of the often beautified TR.The Perils of Prosperity is a worthy read for anyone interested in the social and political machinations of the early 20th century.
1	A great second volume: As of always Norman Geisler pumps out another book , which is very clear and sharp on the doctrines of God and the origins of creation.This book and also with his first volume is a must for all theological thinkers.I cant wait until his next volume comes out. Does any one know how many volumes there will be ?.
0	Curious about this book!: I am curious to read this book it sounds inspiring. It is really nice to hear a story about someone who recovered from tragedy. I too am skeptical about the idea of dialysis to treat or overcome schizophrenia. I think it does a bit of a disservice to people with serious mental illness who have to take or often refuse medication with difficult side effects to advocate an experimental and risky "cure" with no significant treatment outcomes but it's a definite read.
1	Travel Prep for Italy.: I checked this out to get more background before a trip to Italy. I am going to recommend it for a young (middle school) friend in anticipation of future travel.I appreciate things more if I know why it is so special. I can imagine this age group could be pretty bored if they don't "get" why this stuff is so special & they'd rather be home with their video games. Donatello is more than a turtle with attitude.
0	Komplete Mess: This is a TERRIBLE version of Mortal Kombat 4! The graphics are awful,the sound and music is ear aching,and the gameplay is beyond hideous.This plays just like MK3 did on the gameboy...like total krap! Actually,it may even be worse than MK3! Avoid this at all costs!
0	What planet am I on?: What planet am I on.....isn't this earth? I have to check because I recently saw a terribly boring and vastly overrated movie called Dreamgirls. You would think from all the hype this movie got it would have been the best musical since the Wizard Of Oz! Instead what I saw was another example of a bunch of snob critics trying to sell me a chocolate covered lemon. I won't criticise each aspect because there isn't anymore time left to spend on this waste of a good two hours of time. Jennifer Hudson.....an Oscar.....for this.....FOGGEDDABBOUDDIT. And just when you thought Grease 2 was as bad as it gets. This is worse!
0	Not at all what I expected: No disrespect to Ms. Jennifer Hudson, but this was the worst thing I have tried to watch in a long, long time. It was a valiant effort but sometimes you just wanted to scream as it went on and on and on and on. This would have been so much better as a movie and not a musical. It just was not very good to me as I tried to watch it. I had to finally turn it off about 3/4 of the way through it. JMHO and no disrespect intended.
0	It does have a story, sort of: Repetitious. I lasted one hour watching this before I left the room. My spouse was able to watch it to the end and enjoy the story underneath.I gave Moulin Rouge one star, partly because of the shrill grating voices. At least Dream Girls has more natural voices. And it was fun to see how different performers of the era were represented by these fictional characters. And there was at least one educational piece of historical information: Elvis was not the original singer for Hound Dog. It was Big Mama Thornton, but her version was suppressed by mainstream white radio.
0	Ouch: So I decided since eveything was in such a hype of dreamgirls I would watch it.Bad idea. Has anyone ever seen movies like Cabaret or hell even Sound of Music?That is how you do a musical, not some horrible cheesefest of actors. I don't know about anyone else, but I am really tired of Jamie Foxx and his horrible attitude towards almost anything. By the time this movie started to get an interesting plot it was almost over, and the music wasn't even that catchy at all.It was annoying after awhile, actually. I enjoyed this movie when they weren't singing, but it was just painful when they were.Also it was extremely perdictable. I knew what was going to happen before it did, which makes it boring to watch.The only reason it is getting any stars at all is because of Eddie Murphy and when they weren't singing.
0	Boring: This movie is totally boring. There is no plot. I am glad I just rented it from the local library.
0	NightmareGirls: At about the 90 minute mark, I felt that my nightmare was just about over. I then remembered that there was about 40 minutes left to this string of cliches. I plan to start a12-step recovery group for myself and others who have been traumatized by this travesty. What was so bad about it? Only the writing/acting/music/period-detail/directing...everything else was pretty good.
1	"Dreamsgirls "- A Dream Movie!: "Dreamgirls" is an absolutely outstanding adaptation of the stage production. Jennifer Hudson absolutely shines. This is the first movie I have seen in many, many years where an audience was moved to cheer and applaud. During Jennifer's rendition of "I am Telling You", the audience responded as if we were at a live concert. "Dreamgirls" is a treat and an absolute delight. The acting, the singing, the musical score and the costumes are all award-winning calabre. I congratulate a great cast on their wonderful performance.
1	Best dvd edition ever: This edition is worth the price. A 3rd disc which is a Target Exclusive features: "One Night Only" dance remix video (4 mins.) I luv the remix video. It's Faboulus!!!!
0	Totally blah: This was a very uninteresting waste of time. Thank goodness C. S. Forrester wrote other novels; I would never have bought any of his novels if I had read this thing first.
0	First greek zombie flick ever...: Evil is the first ever greek horror film which deals with...zombies and because i'm a zombie fan and also a greek u can imagine my happiness when i heard about this movie so i went straight and watched it in a greek theater with many expectations but unfortunately although it was a nice try it had nothing to do with the superb romero series and it suffered with the disease that all greek productions are suffering. The lack of experienced actors but that's another topic.Anyways, if u are a zombie fan check this out BUT i warn you u will be tired as time passes by.There are some good scenes like the last one with the soccer field but that won't save the movie.A Cult movie because it's the first ever greek zombie flick but it will never be a classic one.
1	Like a drug you take by listening: This music is incredibly relaxing. I have never listened to anything that helps me chill and think like this cd does. It leveled my thinking to a pace where I wasn't slow, but at the same time wasn't racing through ideas too fast to properly consider them. It is like a drug that is taken auditorily, by listening to it, and the effect is clarity of mind, calming of the spirit, and lucidity into one's life.
0	Nice retrospective... but not too informative: Author rambles on about various old designs and the philosophies of the designers/builders, interspersing a few fuzzy B&W pictures and snippets of hull profiles. Might be interesting to the history buff, but if you want clear, relevant information on how to build a wooden boat... this book isn't for you. There are many others to choose from - I'd recommend Buehler's Backyard Boat Building and Gerr's Strength of Boats as two helpful books I've read so far.
0	Not For Those Who Wish To Build Boats: The book is filled with stories about boats, not about boat building techniques or anything really of use to someone who is interested in building plywood boats, buyer beware! This title is misleading.
1	good purchase: Thank you very much! I Recommend mixing this with apple juice, mango, banana and ice. Almond milk and banana is good too. I don't recommend it with berries, although the Macro reds might go well with them. Purchase a personal blender and your good to go!
1	Actually Awesome: For any product to actually make a difference in my physical well-being, I most certainly feel I owe a review. The actual ingredients would be good for anyone, but particularly helpful for one with low energy problems and difficulty eating all the fruit and vegetable servings recommended in our Food Pyramid (which I DO believe in). Also I am super caffeine sensitive and was relieved that the small amount of it in the green tea component didn't phase me in the least, i.e. no shakes. In total I simply have more energy that feels organic and am also calm because I feel better!
0	Excess Sweetness and Filler: What an overpriced disappointment. All I taste is excess sweetness from Stevia. Why are almost all green formulas sweetened? Either you want the greens or not, but don't change the taste with a sweetener.It's also loaded with Lecithin, an inexpensive soy by-product used as a filler and promoted as something good.... it's not.The only greens formula I know without sweeteners and fillers is Garden of Life Perfect Food, the Original Formula. Better yet, make your own green powders from Barley or Wheat grass, Chlorella, Spirulina, and Alfalfa powder from NOW Foods .
1	Awesome piano trio jazz: On this disc Kenny teams up with two other heavyweights, Charlie Haden and Roy Haynes. These fellows are no strangers to piano trios and this disc illustrates why. There are a variety of cuts from the lyrical Billy Strayhorn Passion Flower to some very aggressive modal jazz such as Madman. You hear some wonderful improvisation and the interplay between these gentlemen is wonderful to listen to. I have to say that their reading of Passion Flower ranks at the top of my list. Kenny really shows his dexterity in a very lyrical way. In the end it is the Bop influences that make this such interesting music to listen to. This disc is trio jazz at its finest.
1	Never Cry Wolf: Amazing True Story of Life Among Artic Wolves: You'll laugh and you'll cry at the early adventures of this real life naturalist. Farley Mowat's writing is a joy to read, his words conjure up pictures in your mind and keep you turning the pages. Then you'll remember that there was a movie by the same title and you'll rent the CD which will also not disappoint you. After that, you'll want to know more about Mowat, his remarkable childhood and how he became the person he is today.
1	Wolf Behavior: Interesting and Entertaining: This book is a quick and enjoyable read that will dispel some myths about wolves. The author traveled to a remote are of northern Canada in the summer of1948 to study wolves, which were supposedly destroying the caribou population. The actual culprit turned out to be human hunters. His sympathetic descriptions probably didn't do much for his career with the Canadian government, but may have changed some minds about the threat that wolves pose to people.Excellent descriptions of wolf behavior in their natural habitat, including the interaction of an immediate family with pups and various groups that live in adjacent territories. Some of the behaviors he observed had not been seen before by scientists, and he was accused of fabricating them, but most of these observations have since been verified by others.At times, Mowat could be accused of attributing human motivations to animal behaviors. If this bothers you, you many not fully enjoy this book.
1	Which version to get?: Well, I've read the reviews here and couldn't do any better. Also, I suggest you read Roger Ebert's take on this wonderful film. A must see for fans of Japanese cinema and for anyone who appreciates cinema as an art-form and not just entertainment.I own both the Milestone release and the Asmik release (got via Amazon.co.jp). I agree with [...] - the transfer and the director's cut/extras found on the Japanese Asmik version are far superior than Milestone's (and far cheaper). Try to find the Japanese version if you can. I'd be selling my Milestone version *to get rid of it* but I let my sister have it. Four and1/2 stars.
1	Hypnotic: A quiet, surreal, psychological horror story. There is much to contemplate in this tale of an entomologist, the woman with whom he is imprisoned, and the savage villagers who derive both their livelihood and a twisted sense of pleasure from the couple's predicament. It says much about the ambivalence that many Japanese feel toward society: on one hand, they feel a sense of obligation to sublimate their own needs to those of the group; on the other, there is a deep sense of resentment and a feeling that they are not properly appreciated for their sacrifices. The only flaw with this film is that it sometimes belabors the point.
0	What was i thinking?: I bought this game because it seemed like a pretty cool product. I was wrong! This game is not thrilling and it just doesn't seem to have a point. What were they thinking when they made this game? I sold mine because it was just useless to me. I didn't get very much but anything was better than keeping it around.
1	Lyrical prose. Masterfully told.: The reason why it is so important to pay attention to description is because Richter uses nearly every detail to help tell the story. The prose is evocative in the tradition of some of the best modernist writing at the time like Willa Cather. Despite the occasional misplaced modifier, Sea of Grass is definitely a book that deserves a close reading--if only for Richter's poetic prose that makes you want to read out loud.
1	Just what I expected: Everything about the purchase was good and the meter is just what I expected. I have had cheap meters before and am thrilled with the upgrade.
0	Great visual, poor plot: Nothing much happens in this movie. The movie moves so slow,106 minutes feel like 4 hours. Of the106 minutes, 90 are merely scenes of the African landscape accompanied by music. Yes, it is beautiful but I'd rather have a storyline.The social and sexual tensions are barely explored, they are barely grazed, merely hinted at. I fast forwarded through half the movie, hoping to stumble upon a good scene that never came. Slow moving, tediously boring and with a plot that is never explored. The racial relations are purely explored. We get more exploration of racial and sexual relations in "Growing Pains - The Complete First Season" PLUS a message of the week!
0	A Lite Alternative: Songs like "Follow My Way", "Can't Change Me" and "Flutter Girl" are admittedly catchy. Cornell's voice is strong throughout. But, ultimately, this is coming-out music for someone who just bought their first grunge clothes at JC Penney.
1	I wanted a LITTLE more Soundgarden: I'm a more recent Soundgarden fan, but also a fan of Zeppelin, good vocals, good songwriting, and interesting guitar work. This album does not rock in a Soundgarden sense, and is more laid back.Still, the songwriting, guitar and especially Chris' talented pipes really make this an excellent album apart from his former band. He really is one of the best singers in rock, ever, and that fact really stands out solidly here.
0	Wow... this is one awful CD: I was hoping to be blown away by Mr. Cornell's cannon of a voice, but instead found myself falling asleep to uninspired lyrics and down right awful music. All you have to do is look at the pictures of Chris in the booklet to realize this Knight of the Soundtable has lost his way. Avoid this one like the plague.
0	best of his solo efforts and that's not saying much: This is the best Cornell solo effort and thats not saying a lot. Try out his AudioSlave or Soundgarden stuff it's amazing but this is bland and soulless like his Scream album.
0	How can anyone take this seriously?: Lyrically, Cornell sounds like a sub-literate14 year old scribbling deep thoughts in a spiral notebook: hideous. And the music sounds like it was lifted from a bunch of mid 70s Foreigner out-takes: bland, canned guitar rock. So he's got a big-time voice? So what? I can't believe people like this dreck.
1	Cornell shines in Euphoria Morning: Now you see why Soundgarden really broke up. Cornells' music was going in a different direction from the band. After a long wait, the front man of Soundgarden has realeased a good album, and promptly thanks his Soundgarden family many times. Euphoria Morning is best when played all the way through, and is a great pick up for all Soundgarden fans. The one possible draw back is the ommison of the single Sunshower, from the Great Expectation soundtrack.
1	Euphoria Morning Glory: One of the best CD's I have ever heard! Chris is so unique with his singing and compositions, you'll just be amazed, especially if you're playing guitar like I do.I can't wait until his next album...
1	Awesome CD: This was a great solo debut for Chris Cornell. I still cant believe that people are comparing it to Soundgarden, though. IT WAS NOT INTENDED TO BE SOUNDGARDEN. Somebody actually started bashing it because it wasnt like Badmotorfinger. There was noticable change from Screaming Life and FOPP to Badmotorfinger, then change from there to Superunknown, and then further change to Down on the Upside. Why in the heck would you think this album would sound like Badmotorfinger. I love the growth his music has taken. Great Job.
1	oh honey, it's been so long.: Oh, Chris, darling. It's been too long. It is so good to hear your lovely, chills-inspiring voice again. The music, the voice, the background singers...oh how they make me realize how much I've missed you. It's better than gospel. It's Chris.
1	Chris Evolves With Spectacular Results: I was a moderate Soundgarden fan, swept up in the power and bombast of the Seattle sound as a young twenty something when Superunknown came out.This, however, is a bold, unexpected, and100% satisfying departure from that style. The songwriting is varied, crafty and melodic, reminiscient of the Beatles and (and I know this is blashemous) early, early Billy Joel. There isn't a power chord on the whole record, and yet it's still powerful and emotionally charged. It, for lack of a headier word, rocks. A velvet-wrapped sledgehammer.The arrangements are off-kilter and not so radio-friendly. But the songs are irresistable. And the singing is...damn! can that man sing. Thirteen Bucks well spent.
1	Really Good Album that doesn't rip-off Cornell's past...: This is a really good album that manages not too sound like Soundgarden. In fact, if your looking for that, you might as well go play "Superunknown" a few more times. Cornell rarely moves into his "grunge" wail, and instead keeps everything less visceral than his former bandmates. Very Beatle-y circa '67. Solid musicianship and great lyrics, too. Cornell is a long-term player whether Soundgarden fans like this or not.
0	will not work: I have a high end sony blu-ray player, and for some reason this is the only blu-ray that will not play at all and yes I have a network conection. This blu-ray has no scraches either.
1	The Longest Day: A wonderful classic, war movie. They don't make movies like this anymore nor do they have great actors like those in this movie. This is why I buy the older movies. Most remakes are horrid and the actors are worse.
0	gkardd: Don't waste your $ - it wasn't worth buying the blu-ray version. I should have rented the dvd first before spending the blu-ray version.
1	Water Conditioner: This product has been excellent for dosing when performing water changes. Subsequent to its use we have found that our corals "bloom" as full as possible and appear to be at their healthiest. Even thought we produce R/O water using a high end filter with four cartridges including resin and deionization, adding this product to the R/O water when performing water changes seems to improve water quality.Also, when I look at my tank and see my corals are not looking as healthy as I would like, adding this product at the recommended doses produces immediate results and within ten minutes we see a substantial improvement in the look of our corals.
1	what a voice: It's old fashioned and has the fun sweetness of something we no longer have as much......innocence.
0	Bad.: Although I usually enjoy Ashanti's music, I'd have to say her single "Happy" holds a spot as one of her worst songs. It has a slow boring beat and airy, echoing vocals. It samples Gap Band's "Outstanding", but oh well, what do you expect? Also, this single also includes "Call", her album's WORST track. Please, for your own good, skip this.
1	Interesting, atmospheric mystery debut: Hollywood,1941. Screenwriter Keith Moody is about to hit the big time with the dramatization of his cousin's heroic war exploits. Greg Matthew's first mystery is a chronicle of Moody's experience, chock full of quirky humor, nasty characters and implausable plot twists. Its satirical depiction of the movie biz, our weak but willing hero's Faustian dilemma, and a unique love interest are presented in a narrative that soars above the messy plot, creating a portrait of a corrupt and totally fascinating world, as Far From Heaven as possible. Weird and wonderful--I LOVED it
1	Good Sci-Fi flick!: Although I might not go into great detail, I just want to say- I rented this movie, but wish I had it on dvd (my own collection) I thought the storyline was decent and had a surprise or two in it. I like the last person on Earth subject (scary-to say the least) I would say, if you arent sure you want to buy it---its as simple to just rent it. I am glad I took the time to watch it!
1	Quiet Earth and Quiet Film: I liked the quietness of the film and the simple idea behind the premise of the sci-fi story. It's neat to know that Kiwis seem to have a sense of humor even if they were the last people on Earth and take things somewhat in stride. So this film is a little different and underdramatic but has a neat perspective.What I couldn't get over were the ghastley clothes from the 80s. Strange, I know. Three people are the le last o exist on the Earth and I worry about their attire.A film that's different and low key but well acted.
1	The Quiet Earth: Great movie that arrived in perfect condition and played perfectly as well. I would recommend purchasing for this seller at any time.Cheers,Scott
0	The Quiet Earth: Waking up and finding himself alone, with no explanation then, finding out it was his own research companies fault, then finding and falling for the only ...fortunatley YOUNG girl in New Zealand, then finding another bloke, a big young Maori, she changes horses. Being the only 3 alive they sort of stay friends. All very odd, Anyway, the original bloke works out the Apoclypse is going to happen again, But finding out they were alive because they all were in the process of dying, the previous time, they decide to try and kill themselves again, but how, when, where (yawn: why ?) so very drawn out about nothing much.
0	Do Not Waste Your Money Like I Did.: I hated it. I watched it the day I got from Amazon (great service-no fault there) and threw it in the garbage after a lame viewing. My first clue should have been the "winner of 8 New Zealand Academy Awards" banner. As with most PC movies this one involves, as it's climax, inter-racial sex between a red head and a native New Zealander. If you're not into that sort of thing, don't buy it. This has little to do with "end of the world" type action, and more of "Panic in year Zero meets Jungle Fever" type crap. Save your money.
1	Leisurely read: I liked the book Inspector Iminishi Investigates, a leisurely story that is buttressed by the Japanese setting. A large part of my satisfaction was the authentic seeming police procedural. I believe that a Japanese police force would work in this way as opposed to the 48 hours mentality of police in our country,i.e. most crimes are solved in the first 48 hours.I was able to put the book down and would go back to it which is pretty much how I judge a book. Some I can't put down at all hence the 4 stars.
1	Selleck Continues as the Modern John Wayne: Tom Selleck is one of two current western actors who continue the realism of the "old west" western actors in the mold of John Wayne and others. Westerns in todays age are an "acquired taste". Selleck is a natural and in this tale he continues his best efforts as he did in the Sacketts, Quigley Down Under, and the other great Westerns he's excelled in. The story has a character of realism like all the Louis Lamour classics and Selleck portrays the hero in respect to the writers intent to picture the real Old West. Virginia Madsen is an unusual selection for the heroine, but she carries off the role and doesn't detract from the plot. Wilford Brimley again demonstrates his dynamic talents as a great character actor - an unusual role for him but he adds credibility to the plot. And Mark Harmon gives honest credibility to the villian's role of all great westerns. For the Westerns movie buff, another Selleck success is a great addition to one's collection.
1	Powerful and efficient: This product is more durable and powerful than the B&D version. It has one housing with battery with inter-changeable blades where the B&D is two seperate houseings with non-inter-changeable blades. I have had this company's grass shears before and would definitely buy this brand again.
0	powerless cutter: I purchased this grass cutter to trim a small area around my sons grave which takes about five minutes. when I first received this item it worked fine. Now after the battery is fully charged it does not last more than a minutes. I have wanted to return it because it has it has a lifetime guarantee please let me know how to get a replacement
0	poor life cycle - not a smart buy: We bought this in 4/09 and gave it VERY moderate use. We have little trimming but the product looked like a good buy. Initial use was impressive with good battery life that was always kept recharged. it was never exposed to wet conditions and never used inappropriately.We did buy an extension handle that did not work because the plastic electrical connection was misaligned. We returned that one and asked for another, only to find the same misalignment, so we gave up on the handle idea.We have kept this equipment immaculately clean amd stored in moderate temps.Now (3/10) we have a dead battery that cannot be charged. The service / support has been turfed to a third party that is only interested in selling replacement parts.I'm unwilling to spend any more $$ on what appears to be a great idea gone very wrong.RECOMMENDATON: Don't buy. Look elsewhere.
0	Worth equal to toilet paper: do you want a summary of this book?Stupid kid: "Hey Mr. Manager, how about you teach me some managing stuff to manage people"Manager:"you want me to teach you some managing stuff to manage people with"?Stupid kid: "yeah i want you to teach me some managing stuff, to manage people with"Manager: "allright, ill teach you some managing stuff to manage people with"Stupid kid: "you mean to tell me you'd teach me some managing stuff to manage people with"?Manager: "i dont like repeating stuff, ill show you some managing stuff to manage people with"*repeat thought out the whole bookif you are in idiot and you think books like rich dad poor dad are good books, then prepare for a heart warming storyif not, dont waste your time like i did, this bs could have been written in a greeting card
0	Not a big deal!: Another business book from bestseller list. Does it really help your vision? I do not think so. It is simple, well written, easy to read book. But, I did not get anything from it. If you have really have time, go ahead and read it. By the way, it takes only 45 minutes to finish it.
1	Worth more than One Minute: A little oversimplified and repetitive, but still a classic management book. Every leader should read this. Its concepts are so simple, and yet, there are so many managers in the world who remain ignorant of them! I wish every boss and senior colleague I have ever had, have, and will have would read this book.
1	For the real manager.: This book is for the real manager who is looking for ways to improve efficiency, and just the overall attitude of a company or corporation..
1	Clifford's First Valentine's Day Was Great!: Cliffords first Valentine's Day is a good book. It is best for kids the age of 4-6 because it uses small words. It is also easy for the children to comprehend. Clifford jumps into the mail cart and gets lost in the mail. I would recommend this book to any children interested in books. It is a good book.
1	Grandmas Bliss: I love all the books by Debbie Bliss. Lots of patterns and Ideas. If you love her yarn you will love the books too.
0	Cannot even compare to the book!: Terrible, terrible, just terrible! Ms. Isaacs, how can you letthem do this to your marvelous book! The plot, the actors justbutchered it. And don't even mention that Melanie Griffith. Linda Voss is supposed to be this confident, working girl but instead she made her out to be this wimpy, whispery-voiced wishy-washy sort of girl. Okay here is my advice. If you want to enjoy this movie, see it first then read the book by Susan Isaacs. You should look it up on Amazon too and see how highly it is recommended. I read it first and the movie was an unmitigated failure and disappointment to me. I could just cry thinking about it. I really wish they would make another movie out of it, but this time do it right and just follow the book which is just too perfect and which one cannot go wrong in following. Okay enough talk, read the book, forget the movie.
1	The Shining: I'm a sucker for a wonderful love story and I love watching movies with history to it and it takes place when I was born.
1	SPY, SUSPENSE, THRILLER, AND FABULOUS LOVE INTEREST: A love affair between an American spy and his secretary During WW2 is taken to Germany behind enemy lines when German scientists are suspected of developing a very destructive bomb. A Fabulous romantic love story with great actors, a fantastic background sceneries and great costumes. A very enjoyable movie.The quality of the DVD is good. One minus though, this DVD comes almost without any additional features.
0	Worst. Economics. Text. Ever.: This really is the worst Economics textbook I have ever encountered. This 466-page soft cover text is absolutely miserable, both in terms of clarity and organization. In addition, many fundamental concepts are not present in the text - the author cites them as "beyond the scope of this book." The book even resorts to bad grammer and poor editing in places. The level of incompetence on the part of the text's author is truly astonishing.
1	Pretty Darn Good: I normaly spend my time cringing at the writing of computer science authors. This book is fairly straight forward. It skips a beat here and there, but not so much that it stops one dead in the tracks. It is an exhaustive read and only on the basics. I thought that more depth is eventually needed when Cocoon gets finalized, but this is about as good as it gets right now.
0	Tuner Technology: Analog: This shows up under digital ... but if you look closer it reads ... Tuner Technology: Analog
0	Tasteless and pathetic: A little too much graphic sex and too little romance. I am a romance writer and definetly no prude but there's a fine line between vulgar and tasteful. This story is just plain vulgar. It's like Penny Jordan couldn't find anything else for the characters to do so she just writes a lot of smut until Julia gets knocked up and Silas admits he loves her. The gist I also got from this story is that they're distant relatives, grossness! Plus Silas is egotistical and way too pushy. There's nothing wrong with being a modern day girl who enjoys sex but Julia just sounds like a sl*t instead of a likable heroine. Want a better read with tasteful sex scenes? Then read Fugitive Fiancee by Kristin Gabriel or Father by Choice by M.J. Rodgers or the Wedding Planners trilogy by Darcy Maguire. They're written better without a lot of smut like this book!
0	May I use your Umbrella?: ....those of you who have seen this movie will get my title. I think the Umbrella scene was just fantastic! In this sequel, we are following the path of the younger brother of the killer in the first movie. Which is a very good B movie, it was even picketed for it content..you know a movie is good if people wanna get rid of it. Anyways, so we have Eric Freeman playing the younger brother, haunted by flash backs from the first movie (which this movie has alot of flashbacks), he begins a rein of terror in a santa claus suit, as did his brother. all the b movie elements are evident here. bad acting, nudity, sex, killing, blood, etc. I recommend this movie to anyone that has seen the1st one. The 3rd isn't bad either. Stop there. 4 and 5 have nothing to do with the first 3.
0	BAD MOVIE: My friend and i were looking for a bad horror movie, and we found it. First of all, it was 50% the first film, which is strange because in our video store it's labled that you must be18 to rent it and we're younger than that and we rented this one. The story is stupid. PLEASE! santa? The writhers of this must have been high or something when they wrote this.
0	Awful: This book just isn't worth it. Whether one is or is not an Imus fan, he is a fascinating subject for a biography. But this book is basically a rehash of things that have been said or written elsewhere. It has a number of out-of-date references, has nothing but dated pictures from more than ten years ago, and has factually inaccuracies and misspellings. Sorry, but don't waste your time or money.
0	IMUS. AMERICA'S COWBOY: This is a very poorly written book. The author comes across as being too smart by half. For instance she writes of a radio station XELO out of Del Rio, Texas that had an early influence on Imus. She goes on to explain that the station got around FCC transmitter power limitations by locating the transmitter in Juarez. If she had checked her geography she would have noted that Juarez is about 400 miles from Del Rio and the transmitter was actually located across the Rio Grande from Del Rio in what was then called Villa Cuna.She goes on to tell of Imus and his friends doing parodies on a con man named Billy Sol Estes, whom she writes was involved in a salad oil scam, when in fact it was chattle mortages on fertilizer tanks.This may seem like nit picking but given these inaccuracies how does one accept the rest of this book, or any of her other books as being factual?She does give some insights into Imus's character and background that are interesting.....if true.
0	Huge problem with this book!: There is one huge problem with the premise of this book and that is that MARY DOES NOT HAVE GRANDCHILDREN. She is ever-virgin and has only birthed Jesus, God's son. Jesus never married or had children, so how could Mary have a grandchild? When I see books like this that get past publishers (Christian ones, to boot!), I have to wonder where this world headed.
1	Most Relaxing: My husband bought this CD for me many years ago...copyright date1993. After14 years of listening, I still find it to be one of the most calming, relaxing CD's I own. Listening to it (especially with earphones/surround sound) transports me out of a mood of stress-related irritability into a world of tranquility and relaxation.
0	The Digital Caliper Did not work!: I am very disatisfied! I purchased this as a Christmas present. We got a call 2 days later saying it did not work! I tried to contact Apex Tools and they never returned my calls! Now I am stuck with a product that does not work and that I cannot return because no one has returned my call!
1	Nice for the price: Really nice quality for the price. Nice case for storage and protection when not in use. Easy to use and the spare battery is a nice bonus.
1	Digital calipers: Good quality calipers with digital readout at a terrific price. Very useful measuring device for my wood shop.
1	Good Tool Low Price: This is a great tool! it is quite accurate for a low price. not much more to say
0	Worth what you pay for it - no more!: If you think there's some magic and you're getting a precision digital caliper for $9, think again. This is a steel ruler that happens to have a digital readout. I guess the precision would be enough for some applications (e.g., wood carpentry) but I would not recommend it for precision mechanical or electronic applications. In particular, the depth gauge feeler on mine was slightly bowed and did not fit precisely in the guides for it, making accurate measurements with it impossible. Lesson learned, I'm coughing up $85
1	Great condition: Another book with which I was very pleased with its condition. It also came in the time allowed for. I was very pleased.
1	Wonderful Period Piece: Most of us know the story of The Legend of Sleepy Hollow - likely through Disney's well-crafted and true to the original adaptation of this Washington Irving classic, but it is worth the effort to explore the original. It is wonderfully written and contains a good deal of period language that has dropped out of our vernacular. The book is a quick read, with vibrant descriptions of colonial life in upstate New York.I recommend reading in the early fall, with a good scotch and a roaring fire.
0	I'm done with this show....: I used to love this show, but it's just too ridiculous now. This season we've only watched so we could see how Ted meets the kids' mother.... But I just don't care any more.Security pulls guns on Barney at the airport but he has no reaction? Barney's apartment is decorated like a Hello Kitty fanatic's place? How stupid.I haven't laughed with this show for a LONG time.
0	Please send me the product: Many weeks ago I bought this product and it is not shiped yet, when you will send it to me?
1	Having fun watching it: I love it. the story is interesting, each character has his/her own personality. Unpredictable development of the story. i really enjoy it.
0	naked truth: I was not trying to buy this because I already bought the entire season. I just could not get it to play so I think I ended up paying again.
0	still waiting: I think one have to be very passionated about the delivery time, even if I was warned for the late delivery.Now it takes "TO" long waiting. I'm afraid I never will receive this product. What about my payment I already did do long time ago. I only hope the Amazon seller "KRUSHCO WRESTLING" will not run away with my money without delivering.
1	Captured Live!!: NRBQ have released a few live recordings but this one seems to capture the band's comraderie. They are having fun and so is the audience. Everything seems spontaneous yet well coordinated. They are a fun, cohesive band. This disc is a blast! I've worn out my cassette and am purchasing the CD!! Thanks Uncle Q!
0	bad: i dont like to read books but i will read a book that gets my attention and when i started reading this book i hated it this book was very boring and uninteresting and just dull nothing interesting happened. the main girls sister had diabetes then shes hospitalized because she doesnt want to do what she has to then they get a new house guest who tells the girl about the pirate queen and the dad isnt around much in the book but thats not really anything interesting because the way it was written it just didnt get my attention at all.written by courtnee E.
0	Total Waste: This is one of the greatest wastes of talent I've seen in some time - and I've seen some stinkers. Why Caan and Powers accepted this script is beyond me but at least they survived its embarrassment and went on to much greater things. I can forgive a lot in a Western and can avoid the others but this one should just quietly be forgotten.
1	You need to give this one some time. Rewards will come.: The first time I heard this I thought I'd finally found it. A truly unworthy Robert Pollard/GBV release. The first impression you'll get is "where's the tunes, Bob?". Songs begin with odd a capella chants, strange vocals and weird conversations. But after quite a few repeated listenings you will find what you love about Bob which is a truly masterful grasp of the joy of pop music. This time Bob has thrown us for a loop but songs like In the House of Charles Augustus, Red Ink Superman, and Harrison Adams finally shine through and give you "that feeling" you get when you discover a Bob gem.
1	The Offical All My Children Trivia Book: I bought this book because my FAVORITE show was taken off. It is a great collector book for people like me. It contained things that I had forgotten about even though I had watched the show for 40 years.
0	Survival Island, should read, Sink me Island: Another hype movive that is so, lets keep it basic, stupid. one scene she takes off all her clothes and comes out with her bottoms on. and there are more of this camera work. it's just a bad movie.
0	Sucked: You know those movies that make you feel sick and disgusted, and wish you didn't see the movie to begin with. Well, this is one of those movies. Man, those writers in Hollywood have no class or morals. I don't know what they paid Kelly Brook to do the movie, but I'm sure she realizes now it wasn't worth it.
1	5 Stars for Kelly Brook!: If you like Kelly Brook the British bombshell you should see this movie! Kelly is hot running around the island in a white bikini. There are also some nude scenes and Kelly shows off her perfect legs, ample mellons and her perfect shape. After she washes ashore on the island we see her laying on her tummy in the sand until she regains her strength. The camera hovers on her butt for a bit. Thank you! She has the perfect bottom. Also lots of skinny dip scenes with Kelly topless and less. She gets attacked by the sailor and this scene goes completely nude. There is a surprise twist to this scene.Kelly Brook fans will enjoy this movie!
0	Really?: So, who wrote this, because it had to be a man. Of course, women could never survive without a man, could they? And wouldn't they just do the silliest possible things imaginable? Treat each other terribly? Or run around with flowers in their hair and dance all day? Not one of them would be able to grow their own food, and for sure - they would absolutely drug and abuse any other women out of what? jealousy? Oh please. The only good part of this is the end where the only man alive after the rain is GAY!This is just awful, not campy. It belittles women in every possible way. Save your money.
0	useless product: when i first received the product, it worked ok. my grandaughter who is almost 5 and wiegh 40 pounds, bent both rods an now it is broke and usless
1	Satisfied: Other than one of the two screws needed to install this product was missing, I have no issues. The problem was in packaging, as a small crinkled piece of tape was used to stick the loose screws to the back of the plastic crusher. Then the shipping box had cracks in it, so the screw apparently came loose and fell out during shipping. Missing hardware seems to be the norm these days no matter where you purchase products. So far the crusher works great. Time will tell as it is made of plastic, but seems to be sturdy.
1	small but mighty: great product if you only use12 oz cans; had a party, bought16oz cans and had to smash them all by hand, they won't fit unless you bend them a bit at the top by yourself and then you have to hold them in place and try to smash, not very productive. otherwise, great
1	Best Can Crusher: I can't believe I have been crushing and recycling cans for 30 years and have been wasting my time with other crushers. I just installed the Easy Pull crusher and got to work crushing the cans that have backed up since my old crusher died and all I can say is Wow! Easy Pull is hands down the best can crusher I have ever used, none of the others even come close! I know this unit costs three times what my old one did but it is worth every penny. One more nice thing about it: because it is made mostly of plastic (nylon) it is much quieter that other crushers (just an added bonus).
0	Junk!!: This thing is JUNK! After crushing only 4....yes 4 cans it snapped in two. Way over priced for the quality. It's nothing but plastic. I would recommend spending a lot less on a different product...which will probably quarantee at least more than 4 total cans crushed over the life of the product.
0	No caller ID: As the last review says - I too did not realize this model does not have caller ID. Sellers should state this specifically. Very disappointed as well. Wish I had seen the previous complaint before purchasing.
0	Cats had fleas within a month: Both cats were infested with fleas, the worse they have ever had within a month of using these collars, and both my cats are indoor only cats. I was very disappointed.
1	Space Invaders: Space Invaders rocks!!! The cool 3-D graphics are so cool! I have it for Game Boy Advance SP. I got all the way through the game and won!!! It is a great game to play!
1	Just Plain Fun: Sure the graphics aren't stunning but for some unexplicable reason this game is just plain fun, I haven't yet treid out multiplayer but I know that the regular game is really fun!
0	The only book that I actually wish to never even see again.: The first time I tried to read this and failed I assumed that maybe I was distracted and would try again later. The second time I convinced myself that I had too many books on the go at the one time. The third time I told myself that I was too busy to give it the time it deserved. Frankly, I have now learnt that if you need to try for the fourth time to read something and have to force yourself to keep turning the page it is a bad sign.This is frankly the only book that I have purchased that I not only don't want anymore - but I don't want to inflict it on anyone else by giving it to charity. The story was woeful. The characters are impossible to like or in any way relate to. This is my quiet warning. If you are simply looking for a good read you are wasting your time here.
1	Tender: One of the most tender and true to the heart works by E.M. Forster, teenagers as well as adults will find this classic one that will keep them up all night. The gentle love of young middle classed Emerson for the wealthy Lucy his only heightened when his uncontrollable love for her fluctuates. He doesn't know how to tell her!!! And when he does try to tell her, he only shocks and suspends her. Fantastic!
0	Blurry, Faded, and Flat: This print arrived today; as soon as I unrolled it I realized I had made a mistake with this purchase. The quality is worse than if I had printed it on "fast draft" on my inkjet printer. The colors are incredibly under saturated, the contrast is extremely low, and the details are blurry.The original work is dark, and bright, with every shade of red and gold and grey. This is predominantly beige and brownish-orange. I never expected them to be able to replicate the actual metallic paint in the "5" in the center, but the colors of this whole print are way off.Furthermore, the entire painting is not on this print- about an inch all the way around is missing- in the original painting, on the right hand side, the window says "...ART CO." however this print has the "CO." cut off.This print is going in the trash.
0	I would rather scrape: I dont care for this item. I would rather scrape the windshield off. The elastic is to short to hook onto anything. I bought two and they are going in with our rummage sale items, to be sold or given away.
1	GREAT PRODUCT.: the shield is easy to install and works great. I used to scrape frost off my girls cars for10 minutesand now 2 seconds to remove the screen.
1	There is no better Physics text for the non-Ph.D. reader.: This excellent series of texts covers almost every topic in modern physics. This is the only book on Physics that covers all this complex physics topics that could be understood by anyone with a college degree. However, for those without background in Calculus, you may have some trouble.
0	The lame observations of an unfunny man.: I'll keep this short since I've already wasted enough time reading this garbage. Chuck Klosterman presents his limited view on a number of uninteresting topics. He presents his humorless observations as if they have some bearing in absolute truth, when they are just solely his poorly thought out perceptions. The only reason one would purchase a book such as this is to get a laugh. However, there isn't a single funny line in this entire book.
0	Can you say boring three times fast?: Oh, how I wanted to love this book. I love books about nothing, especially when people write about nothing very well. Nothing can be really amusing, and nothing is the perfect prelude to sleep. This book, however, almost induced a coma with all of its pretentious stupidity and references to Pamela Anderson and various serial killers. While the effort to be Deep and Outrageously Funny shown through like a 5000 watt lightbulb, the actual result amounted to one of the most mind-numbing and tedious expositions on Nothing that I have read in a long time. (Read at your own risk.)
1	clever: I liked this book. I can't say I loved it (hence, the 4 stars), but I really liked it. Crafty, clever, and every bit of life should have a soundtrack.He knows his pop culture and he has a way of reminding you of what you thought you knew but had 'mis'-forgotten. Clever material ranging from Zach Morris to Pam Anderson to Billy Joel. A quick read and the kind of read that actually provides interesting resources for how to look at what only appears to be the benign things that constitute this culture. Good stuff.
0	you're better off reading cocoa puff box.: This book is a complete waste of time. I can't imagine how anyone could get an ounce of entertainment or enlightenment from this book.The one part that sticks out is the short essay on probabilities. The author says that there's only one probability in life: 50/50, everything is either going to happen or not. So the odds of winning the lottery: 50/50. I assume that if you are capable of reading this review that you understand this is blatantly false.Maybe I should start writing books. Here's my first essay: we don't need weathermen. The weather tomorrow is either going to be hotter or colder than it was today. Three days from now it will either rain or not. I'm sure if I stretched that theory out, added some flowery language, and gave it a catchy title the new yorker would tell all their readers that they need to like my book.
0	Limited Coverage: I agree with the other comments about the coverage only being for large metro areas or POI such as Grand Canyon or Wine Country. For intermittent information between large cities it nothing.Really not worth $50. get an AAA book
0	Rip-off!: Garmin and Fodors should be ashamed of this product. The coverage is absurd. In Washington D.C. I looked for a restaurant near my current location. Nada, but I was surrounded by a wide variety of places to eat, some of them very highly rated by local media. This guide wanted me to go most of the way across town, an expensive cab ride, to a neighborhood that I was advised wasn't very safe. You're better off to Google the city before you visit and take along a few pages of printouts. Do not waste your money on this piece of garbage.
0	Hampered by use of custom libraries: Being an O'Reilly fan it is hard for me to find fault with their no-nonsense approach to technical books, but there is one MAJOR issue I have with this book.As a developer for a major corporation I cannot use custom libraries for my work, especially when the license (http://www.servlets.com/cos/license.html) does not allow for commercial use. Where it would be helpful to see details on creating say, a multipart request class, Bruce Perry instead uses the com.oreilly.servlet.MultipartRequest class to hide much of the functionality (this is just one example).This makes little or no sense. Developers in the real world need real examples. Hiding the implementation of such under the non-commercial license pretty much ruins much of the potential application of an otherwise well written book. If you buy this book realise that only some of it will actually be useful in the real world.
1	'The Engager' - works good: Our company had some trailers that had dead batteries in the 'break-away' systems. Instead of just replacing batteries - (which were quite expensive) I decided to replace the whole system. Found the 'Hopkins Engager' at Amazon. It was cheaper than a battery for our existing systems and came with a switch and everything else new. It was easy to install and it works good. I really like the battery meter that tells if your charge circuit is working on the pull vehicle. Good product
1	Prior Reviews Are Not of This Set: I have not heard all of this set yet. I have the box Verve box set too and it is really great. The Verve Songbook Box has lots of the same material as included in this box set.The point of my writing this review is that all the prior reviews of this set are really from earlier issues of Ella's music. None of the reviews are of this set. All of the other reviews are dated before this set actually was released.More later.
0	Terrible quality control.: The Charge TTi that I received was stuck on one side so the bottle opener and screwdriver would not open or lock correctly. I understand that titanium can be difficult to work with, but something like this should have never made it past quality control. A defect like this is totally unacceptable, especially on a Leatherman that costs over $100. I am very disappointed and will be returning this tool immediately.
1	Perfect Tool!: This product is really nice. I love how light weight it is, yet so incredibly durable. Leatherman is a great company and I have to say, to this day, I have not had a bad product. One thing I Like better than my surge is the scissors both have scissors but i like that the Charge is spring assisted just smoother cutting. Perfect tool.
0	Crane not real. Cheap toy. Falls apart easily.: I was looking for an inexpensive construction toy for my 3 year old son. This looked like a fun play set but it is a little lame. The crane falls apart when you spin it because it does not clear the back of the set. I thought the crane would move up and down but it has plastic 'ropes' that are fixed and do not move. The ramps detach when you move it. The wrecking ball knocks down the blue shed easily but too easily for my taste. Makes for a high mom/dad maintenance requirement to reset it over and over. The die cast trucks are what you would expect for the price. I expected the toy to be a little on the flimsy side since it was inexpensive I just wish the crane really worked and it held together better.
1	Founding "god" father: This streamlined synopsis of the teachings of Jesus Christ is drawn from the gospels of the bible without any religious dogma. The parables Jesus spoke are compiled nicely and provided me with the life lessons which I attempt to live by.
1	Piece of American History: This bargain is an impoprtant piece of American history. Jefferson was a diest, which they viewed God as like a fine clock maker and made the government intself, not the constitution. They got rid of anything supernatural from the Bible. It stands along side the King James Bible and the1611 edition of the King James, the works of Martin Luther as one of the most important reads for a Christian in American history. I liked it a lot, but it's too skimpy a volume to be a classic, but it is famous.
1	Wolf Woman is the best book I have ever read: Wolf Woman is an exciting story I read. It was about a girl called Wolf-Woman by the clan.Tanith is meant to be part of a family but is treated like an outsider. Then this man, Gibran, has come to say he loves Tanith.``We chose each other, the wolves and I,though our first meeting is so far back in my life that it is lost in the shades of memory.''This is the most exciting part!I think all teenagers should read this book if they like a good book about not fitting with people in with but fitting in well with animals.
0	Borrrrrring: I heard about the game on TV & thought it looked like sooooo much fun, was I wrong, oh yes!!! Theres only a few things todo, make mixes (that turn out really bad), dance(or press falling buttons as they fall) and pick out clothe(the best part of the game!) I mean the graphics r good & I still like Mary-Kate & Ashley, but there's no point to the game really!
1	erinsmom: Love this diaper bag-the only negative thing about it is that I tend to "over fill" my diaper bag, and when you do this, it makes it difficult for the magnet closure to work. But overall, it is great!
1	Not Much Room: I like the bag. It's stylish, gender friendly, and easy on my shoulder! I really like that when I take my son to daycare, he's the only one with this bag! My only complaint is that there is not much room when traveling. When on the road for an hour and a half, two hours, I need to pack extra things and just not too much room for those things. So, I end up taking my old bag.
1	Hillman is authoritative, erudite and comprehensive.: James Hillman's book Kinds of Power, srikes a chord of resonance at every root "chakra" in the human body. Two dozen associates under the rubric of "power" are brought to bear upon the reader. Hillman appears to "make up" his analysis as he goes along, but, with his intellect and breadth of pedantic knowledge, he stays a steady course from start to finish. Hillman is convincing, forever analytical and sufficiently critical. He does have a way of getting off the path at times and entertains his way through some tough issues by employing a bit of sophism. Nonetheless, overall, a book well worth reading.
1	Way to go, Jackie!: This is one game that was a long time in the making, and like his movies, it is full of action. What I like about it is it doesn't try to confuse you with all of the motions you can do by pressing10 million buttons. The plot of the game (Jackie loses package to gang) actually sounds like a plot for one of his movies. Also JC providing his moves and his voice to the game is a real plus. He is one of the most respected moviemakers, and this game shows it. For one thing, it is not excessively violent. Anyone can play. JC sets a good example to kids with that and he is definately a role model in my book. Way to go, Jackie!
0	disappointed: this item did nothing to educate nor inform the audience of the artist Vincent VanGogh as a person nor his work
1	a bomb ... streetball title for your ps2: When I first purchased this game, I was a little skeptical about its play value. I had heard very mixed reviews and I just wanted to see what the games was like for myself. It turns out I made the right choice. This game has a solid street "feel" to it and all the secrets are a nice touch. I mean hey, who wouldn't want to see celebrities and real life ballers shakin' each other up and putting shame on each other. But, every game has its drawbacks. The create-a-baller system and the camera angles are just awful. This definitely needs to be worked on to keep its gamers hooked. The music was good, but gets very repetitive, its much better to just put the music on mute and just play your faorite pump up music. But, still a good game nonetheless.
1	STREET HOOPS: STREET HOOPS IS THE BEST BASKETBALL/AND1 GAME I HAVE EVER PLAYED.IT IS SO TIGHT BECAUSE YOU CAN PLAY GAME MODES LIKE ;KING OF THE COURT,LORD OF COURT,HALF-COURT PICK-UP,AN LAST FULL-COURT PICK-UP.WHEN YOU EARN ALOT OF MONEY YOU CAN GO TO THE STORES SUCH AS;FOOTACTION,THE BARBER SHOP,THE TATOO SHOP,AND THE BET PLACE.THERE ARE OHTER REASONS I LIKE THIS GAME,BUT I HAVE TO GO .SO MAKE SURE YOU GET THIS GAME.
1	This book speaks to the heart of life: I can truly say this book made me come to grips with the focus of my life. I have so struggled to make sense of my time on earth and have I made a difference. Such an important quest comes full circle after reading what happens when all hope is removed. I have given a copy of this book to both my sons. I want them to be fulfilled men.
1	Hope in Suffering: Viktor Emil Frankl, eminent psychiatrist and founder of logotherapy passed away on September1997.A sadness swept through me as I heard of his death. "Man's Search for Meaning" was the very first book of his that I read, and along with many others who have read this best-seller I have been comforted with his simple but sagely advise: "[E]ven the helpless victim of a hopeless situation, facing a fate he cannot change, may rise above himself, may grow beyond himself, and by so doing change himself. He may turn a personal tragedy into a triumph."Dr. Frankl shall be remembered as one who gave humanity the courage to go through life's tumult and to endure suffering with dignity.
1	Search for Meaning: At times this book can be a little dry, but when you look at the book as a whole its a amazing book.The book in part one covers Frankl's experiences in a concentration camp. This part forms the base of the ideas of logothearpy. It's a great story and very interesting to see how person takes to such a horrible event.Second part of the book is on his theory of logothearpy. Very interesting idealogy. Covers some cases in it. The basic idea being that each person creates his own reality and meaning, whatever meaning a person finds in his/her life is the right one.third part is a update taken from a lecture he gave. Goes over some of the same material in part II and expands on it.Great book, worth the day or two it takes to read.
1	Interesting: This book is more than a simple retelling of what happened in the concentration camps. It examines our behavior in times of extreme stress.
1	A path from apathy...: From the perspective of a member in a culture consumed in the "existential vacuum", Frankl's experiences and logotheraphy discussion offers a call to action for those prepared to live a meaningful life. This book will change you.
1	Get a hard copy: If you are intrigued by human nature this is a book for you. If you need a change in perspective this is a book for you. If you feel like a victim, this is the book for you. If you are in recovery for PTSD, Substance abuse, or just plain flat in life, this is a book for you.
1	Very meaningful read: This was a very compelling book to read. I couldnt keep it down till I finished the whole book. The reader will definitely be able to relate himself or herself to the real life examples mentioned in this book. This book gives one the revelation that the difficulties or challenges one faces in life are definitely far more better than the concentration camp experiences of the author and it gives one the confidence to face and overcome any situation successfully in life provided one has found the true meaning of his life. A must read book for all!
1	Inspiring: I read it for inspiration as much as for wisdom. It is hard to image the horrors he must have faced in the concentration camps and the loss of his family. The fact he could come out of it with such vision and ability to inspire and help others is amazing.
1	A book that can help you lifelong: This is the first book I read that can offer ordinary people with extraordinary power to overcome unimaginable difficulties. If one is equipped with such power, he becomes invincible. Such power is not money, ranks, social status, and etc. Instead, it is "man's deepest desire to search for meaning and purpose". That desire will not only shape how one will lead his life, but also make all troubles around him less upsetting compared to the meaning of life. Most of all, he is happy no matter what happens.
1	A MUST Read!: This is life-changer upon one's mindset for facing the trials in life. A truly awesome book. I first received this book as a gift and when I saw the title I knew that this was a book that I would never have bought for myself because of the title "Man's Search for Meaning". Because as a Christian I understand the meaning of life. But this book deepened my understanding of adversity and I found it to be of great value. I then ordered two more books; each for 2 men serving life in prison and I hope this turns their despair to joy.
1	A Must Read: This is a book everyone needs to read at least one or more times.Viktor Frankl has given us invaluabletools for living. His experience hasbrought Logotherapy into being.He gives hope a whole new meaning.
1	Best PS2 Motorcycle Game.: This is the best PS2 bike game available. It isn't perfect, the soundtrack is lacking and the graphics are nothing special. I do however enjoy the physics modelling and gameplay. If you brake while leaned over in a curve the bike will tend to stand up/run wide (very much like my own road going sport bike). The arcade modes are probably too hard for most but the career mode (Riding Spirit) is tonnes of fun. Now if they could spruce up the graphics, add some online play, and improve the soundtrack...
1	Sundrinker by Zach Hughes: A great page turner!! Over much too soon!! This one is heartly recommended and most readers will simply devour it!!
1	Money, Murder and a Dachshund! What more could you ask for?!: I really liked this movie! Yes, it is a bit silly, but it is a movie for the whole family to enjoy! Plus, it is set in Monte Carlo with (the late)John Candy and a Dachshund! I also liked the music, and George Hamilton is a spanish gigolo playboy with a great tan. Also, the several sub-plots, especially with Cybil Sheppard, I thought was played very well. Oh, yes, don't forget the murder of the unseen Dachshund owner! Overall I really enjoyed it and have seen it several times.
0	Fails at its basic purpose Try another brand: These type of toys are supposed to slide out of your hands when you grab them. However this one has a very large (about1/2 inch) seam where the two pieces are fitted together. That seam has also shrunk so is not only is much thicker in that area than the rest of the toy but also smaller. You can sort of see the seam in the pictures (look for the smaller part). The result is the toy only slips until it hits the seam and given the resistance the seams causes, even does that poorly. I have had other brands of this toy and never noticed a seam and they work quite well (are very hard to hold), but this one is pretty much worthless. It can easily be picked up and needs to be forced to slide in your hand. I strongly recommend you try one made by another company.Reading the other reviews, several of the 5 star ones seem a little too enthusiastic and I would not believe them to be genuine.
1	Yeah for Little Bear!: Once again Little Bear and his adorable, loveable friends have proven that good wholesome cartoons are out there! My 3 yr old adores these movies. My older children watched when on Nickelodeon...so happy I found them for my newest addition. Would recommend to anyone who is unsure of what their children should be watching.
1	bear flick: very sweet. keeps our three year old entertained for a while. little bear has always been a favorite in our family.
0	Books review.: Paper material is bad, pale print with only black and white including charts and graphics, bad glue is used to stick up the papers, book started do dismantle after very short period.However the learning material within is very useful and mandatory for some courses.
0	Could have been way more fabulous: The trick is simple: Take a smash tv series, handpick a bunch of popular songs and blend them and record them on a CD. Send it to the retailers, promote endlessly on the aforementioned show and wait for the sales to hit the sky. What? That this CD never went to the top of the charts? Hmmm, wonder why.... Maybe because the tunes can be found in previously released albums? Or because the remixes were not remotely as good as expected? Or maybe because the good-for-all-taste compilation didn't quite work? Whatever the reason was, this is anything but a fabulous soundtrack. And it is sad for me to admit it, being a follower of the Fab Five escapades. Kylie, Junior Senior and Fischerpooner sound odd paired to the likes of Jamelia (!) and Ingrid(!!!)A chance to create a sort of groundbreaking work has been missed. Sign of times to come for the soon-to-be-old TV formula?
1	Good show, good soundtrack, however...: Love the show, and this soundtrack looks great. But buyer beware...the version of "All Things Just Keep Getting Better" is NOT the version you hear during the opening credits of the show. The version on this CD is the newer remixed version which has been featured on the video to the song. IMO the original version (during the opening credits) was far superior and far more catchy. This new remixed version sounds like, well, a remixed version. So be aware of this before buying the CD. But that's all the bad things I can say about it. The rest of the album is great.P.S. If anyone knows where one can find the original version of "All Things Just Keep Getting Better" (if it even exists on CD) please let me know. Thanks.
0	From Fab 5 to Drab13: One of the best parts about the show "Queer Eye for the Straight Guy" has to be the music - bouncy, upbeat and extremely danceable. So when the soundtrack finally came out I eagerly snapped it up. What a disappointment! Aside from an edgier version of the main theme ("All Things Just Keep Getting Better") none of the music that was heard on the show was on it. It looked like Capitol Records chose these13 songs without an ounce of thought into it.After listening to it once, I ended up trading it in at one of those "We Pay Cash For Your Used CD's" stores. Hopefully the next "Queer Eye For The Straight Guy" soundtrack will be a little more truthful and have music from the actual show (including the original version of "All Things Just Keep Getting Better") and not from (for the most part) musical performers on the Capitol label who need a career boost.
1	Good for working out: Good work-out mix but I could have done without two of the songs on this CD. Otherwise, I enjoyed it.
1	Except for the theme song no biggie: CD in perfect condition. I was hoping the other songs were as good as the theme song. Would perchase only if really into the background songs used on the show.
0	Not as good as the rest: My main problem with this book is that it takes Saul's POV the entire time, and to be honest, his need to contradict himself all the time just annoys the heck out of me and takes up too much space. I'm surprised Saul has a guardian angel at all actually. Narlh is the best reason to keep reading. And how stupid is Saul to never realize that Matt is the Lord Wizard of Merovence despite being told that at least 5 times in 3 days??? That one fact alone nearly made me stop altogether, till I realized Matt had to show up sooner or later so I kept on.
1	oh yeah: this is one of those albums with atmosphere. listen to the whole thing through, you can hear oscar peterson's fingers fingers muscling the keys, hear the talking, the glasses, the musicians communicating among themselves. really great jazz piano. this moves, it's alive!
0	okay game: this game [disappoints]i thought this would be a good game but the graphics [disappoint]and the camera views are awful
0	What?: I am very glad I rented this first. I thought it would be good...judging by the good rating. But this game is BY FAR the worst game cube game I've played.
1	Jim Croce Classic Hits: I received this CD as a gift for my birthday as I had heard it at a friend's house. The music is soothing, funny, thought provoking and melodc. Great buy.
0	WHY this single on BILLBOARD HOT100 top10, IF NOT...: Sometime I bought singles or albums depend on billboard hot chart. I bought this sigle when it hit to billboard top10, I even hadn't heard this song once. I listen this song first ime ,just remind me "LAST NIGHT A DJ SAVED MY LIFE" by MARIAH in GLITTER. And J-LO's vocal just like JANET singing "ALL FOR YOU" or MARIAH singing "DON'T STOP(FUNKIN' 4 JAMAICA). l have too many like "JENNY FORM THE BLOCK" music product. IF this single had'nt hit to top10, I can save the $$$.
1	Audubon Guide to African Wildlife: Excellent book with awesome color pictures and good concise narrative on each species and subspecies. It was very easy to identify all the various animals (large and small) and birds when on safari in Tanzania. Highly recommend .
1	If you Love textile art, you'll love this book: I realize few people are aware of this excellent book - and that's a shame! It's in few libraries and available very reasonably priced, hard cover or soft cover. I own hundreds of creative textile books and this is in the top10. It's outstanding. If you find one, buy it - you'll love it.
0	Disappointing: After reading Soulmates Dissipate I couldn't wait for Ms. Morrison's next novel. I thoroughly enjoyed reading about Jada and Wellington. When I saw that they were in Never Again Once More I couldn't wait to begin the book. How could I have known that I would be in for a rude awakening. I was majorly disappointed. The storyline moved too fast and I really wasn't that fond of jada by the end of the book. I don't think Ms. Morrison should have gone as far as 20 years into the future.
1	Very old.: The original build fest game imo, after red alert (which is also an excellent game). Wait for cossacks 2, being released next year.If you must indulge yourself, the online community is still reasonably strong, with many foreign players making up the majority of people there.
0	There are much better games out there: I recieved this game with several others. The graphics might have been good in 2003, but they are laughable in late 2005.In all fairness, I can't speak to many of this games features because I only played for about an hour, but I won't be going back to this game any time soon.
1	An Excellent and Practical Guide To Grammar: I first read and worked with this book on my own about 9 years ago and it really clarified grammar in a practical, "real life" way for me.It has helped me both as a writer and a reader.As a writer I found more options for expressing myself by having more tools to work with and as a reader it helps me decipher endlessly complex sentences that can resemble a linguistic maze.By being able to break down those complex sentences to their basic constituents, one can clearly see which parts of the sentence are functioning as core ideas, and which are functioning as embellishment.This book is very user friendly and is in my opinion an excellent self study guide with an interesting variety of exercises.Highly recommended
1	well done: well written,by by a good mind.All-in-all, it makes me wonder why mankind took a step backwards since the 60's...and....raither the following generations to come will have such brain farts, as those have done who in the last few decades, in the name of LAW and ORDER(that has caused such disorder.Experimenting is how civilizeatoins progess.You can't expect progress when good minds are supressed and restricted.That would of been like telling Ben Franklin"Kites with keys on them are now against the law to take out into a lightning storm,and,could hurt you.So, if you risk hurting yourself, and take kite with keys out in the lightning storm: By law we will hurt you real bad,and those who love you, so you wont risk hurting yourself any more.(yes it is a backwards step) GOD HELP US!But deffinately enjoyable books to read.
0	Kimi is disgusting: She is a little poser!!! Kimi is the most gross and irritating of the babies. Wearing that stupid little diaper, always so happy. She won't be so happy when I kick her between the legs. Also, those stupid little cowboy boots. She really sucks. I'd like to see her get really injurewd and cry. That shown her!!! The movie was good, but she stinks.
1	Brilliant Movie!: This movie is great for the whole family ! I love it ! Its cute , and written very well . My daughter loves the music , she sings all the songs . 5 stars in my book !
1	LOVE: SMARTEST IDEA EVER AMAZON!!! I HAVE BEEN HONESTLY WAITING FOR THIS MOMENT TO HAPPEN EXCEPT YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO BUY FULL SEASONS. I WANT A FULL SEASON OF RUGRATS!:)
1	Great Family Movie: I took my daughter to see this when it was in the movie theater and she loved it so much that I purchased it for her when it came out on VHS/DVD! This is a great movie for young & old! Great family fun & entertainment! Fans of the Rugrats will be cheering for more!If you want to purchase a movie for a child that is a fan of the Rugrats then this is your movie!
1	Wow...: This statue is an amazing piece. The level of detail and craftsmanship is top notch. I'm glad I was able to pick up this piece while it was still available. I'm kicking myself for missing out on the Skeletor statue that was available a couple years ago.
1	Mind and Finger Stimulation: You not only learn how to type more words per minute, efficiently, it is fun while you are learning. It is positively addicting!
1	A Great First CD: Elliott Yamin's new CD is a great new summer release.His easy going, melodic melodies prove why he ended up on American Idol.This CD is perfect for long car rides with the top down this summer. Yamin's soulful and inspired sounds make life easier and less stressful.His selection of songs highlight his talent and his range as a artist. I particulary liked track 9. This song makes a great dancing tune and the whole CD just sparkles.I'm looking forward to his next so I can add it to my collections
1	Just wonderful!!!: It is so nice to listen to a cd without the usual AI overproducing touches. This is music to not only enjoy listen to but music that you feel!! The songs are so real and heartfelt and I am just enjoying this cd so much. I haven't felt this way about a cd in a long time. There is something for everybody. ballads, r&b;, and even some dance mixes.This album will become a classic for me.....
1	One Word: Amazing...: I woke up at 7AM to go get this CD and it was worth being tired all day at work. Elliott's voice can bring a grown man to tears. There is not one bad song on this CD. I still wonder how Mr. Yamin did not win American Idol 5. He is the most talented person to come out of the competition. I highly recommend that you get this CD and buy copies for all of your friends. Look out world, here comes Elliott!*Songs that are on repeat:-Wait For You-One Word-You Are The One-I'm The Man-Trainwreck-A Song For You (Donny Hathaway would be proud)
1	way to go Elliot!: Great cd. I listen to it all the time! Can't wait for his next one. I'm proud of you Elliot!
1	Elliott's AMAZING: I love it. I have never bought an American Idol record before... I've heard the songs they HAD to put out and hated them. I thought Elliott was so good on American Idol that I thought, like many others, that he should have remained on the show (like Daughtry also should have) but, nonetheless, he was dropped. Much to my shock, while walking through a department store I recently heard a song I loved.. it was "Wait for You" by Elliott. I was floored. He sounds SOOOO wonderful. Now I'm one of his biggest fans. Trust me, his voice just doesn't disappoint. And he's so down-to-earth in interviews and when he sings on shows (like Good Morning America, etc) that you can't do anything but just adore him. It's a great album and I look forward to his future released with great anticipation.
0	Late: This book took forever to get. I didn't recieve it for a month! Emailed and recieved no responce.
0	A good approach but filled with errors.: There are too many errors in this edition to recommend it to a beginner. Approximately 75 errors were encountered. For a second edition, it is surprising that these errors were not corrected. Otherwise, I think this book would have been a good introduction to the Russian language.
1	Fantastic: My husband says this cd rates in his all time favorite top 5, which is saying alot because he has over 800 cds in his collection.
1	Where to find on DVD: Story of a young girl who grows up and falls in love with a Mafia hitman who she doesn't know is the one who had accidently murdered her father during a botched hit. She marries him after becoming pregnant only to shoot him at the wedding when a jealous son of the mafia boss tells her that her new husband had murdered her father. If you loved this miniseries as much as I did and want it on DVD, look for it under the titles Bride of Violence1 & Bride of Violence 2. It has only been released full length on DVD in the Netherlands under the alternate title. Keep in mind that this is a region 2 DVD (PAL) and will only play on a region 2 dvd player or a multi-region dvd player. I got one here on amazon for less than $40.
0	This is the one: to get if you don't really want to hear what Bird was all about but want to have something in your collection by him. That's what this record was designed to do, reach the larger white audience with no real interest in Jazz. 2 stars for Bird managing to make something at least palatable out of Hefti's obnoxious arrangements.
0	Couldn't Deal With The Strings...: If you want to hear the real Charlie Parker, don't buy this Cd because the strings are too overwhelming, believe me. I bought it and took it back the same day. And got another one of his cd's instead. Only1 star for this CD but it's not because of Charlie. I don't even think that Charlie Parker would've sincerely enjoyed this.
0	yeah ... right!: Why are there two prats giving this 5 out of 5. They are so obviously joke reviews. This is an awful movie and the zombie scenes are shut with a low shutter speed, so they end up looking like jerky pop-videos.-Mike
0	BORING REVEANGE GHOST MOVIE!: i saw this movie on SCI-FI last night! this movie is supposedly a "zombie" flick! after watching the part were they come in i was like "wait .. wait oh wait they aren't zombies their ghosts!"even killing scenes were AWFUL i swear this movie looks like if it were a MADE FOR TV movie or something! the "killing" scenes are quite laughable considering ALL the horror movies i have seen! but this movie is more of a family drama about a son who finally gets to meet his dad after so long and they both save each other!this whole movie should have just been an1 hour instead of 2!you could sum up the whole flim in1 hour cause is all their doing is driving in the dessert and encountering revenageful ghosts and only 3 of them surive!skip this movie and go for "return of the living dead"!
0	Surprisingly BORING.: I'm a huge fan of all three of the guitarists featured here, but this documentary is just plain boring. It's kinda cool to see each musician play at first, but the longer the movie goes on, the more you realize there is no over-arching POINT to any of it. It's basically just one giant mash-up. It could have been a great movie if it just had something -- ANYTHING -- to say. Instead it just piddles away a couple of hours without making any kind of real impression.
1	if you enjoy music...get this: very well produced...great musiciansif you enjoy the guitar or rock at all, you will like this
1	Fantastic!!: Such a great experience watching three generations of Rock guitarists come together to share their stories an experiences.I hope other musicians and fans get an opportunity to view this. It's quite a testament to music and how it has a profound effect on musicians and music lovers alike!
1	Best guitar movie ever!: I went in special search of this film on blu-ray, you need it in this format in order to get the film without the audio compression, that DVD has. also, if you get this film turn it WAY UP! Jack White steals the show in this film, but Jimmy Page, and the Edge give a solid rock 'n roll history lesson for the ages! this film is one that if you have nothing to do on a Saturday afternoon pull it out and turn it up!
1	Innovative Gem: A factual docudrama-like film. The visuals in this one are so cool, they'll stick in your mind for a long while. Lena Stolze is the young protagonist, who discovers many hidden secrets of her small German town and how their claims regarding their actions during WWII were as manufactured as her own facade
1	I'm stunned there is no US DVD...great film: Can it be that the only DVD edition of this is for non-US countries? I think this film is brilliant. From start to finish, it showed the impact that one person can have with determination. It is a film in my library I watch at least once a year. What a crime to not have a DVD edition!
0	DO NOT BUY this published version: I'm suggesting not buying this text, not because the content is poor, but rather the publisher has defaced its worth. They equations and examples have somehow become gibberish with random symbols, there is no way to read this text and comprehend it. Percy Bridgman however did do a great job presenting dimensional analysis and because the text is no longer copyrighted you can find it on Google books for free.[…]
1	Retro gaming at its best.: This is a wonderful collection of games from the creative heyday of the video game industry. These are bit-perfect ports of the original games; the Playstation is emulating the1980-era hardware and the original game code is running on the emulator. All the original gameplay is there, including the bugs! Because some of the games, Tempest and Asteroid in particular, had touchy hardware, owning these games on CD is better than owning the coin-ops for most folks. If you grew up with these games, you will enjoy the blast of nostalgia you'll get from playing them again. Today's games have better graphics, but they are not better games!In this collection: Asteroids, Battlezone, Centipede, Missile Command, Super Breakout, Tempest.Also included are short video interviews with the creators of Tempest, Battlezone and Centipede.
1	VHS very good new , very nice seller , I recommend !!! Thank you: Cette VHS est un pre bonheur , quelle joie de retrouver GUY WILLIAMS et tous les autres excellents Acteurs pour1 H 30 d'aventures . Merci Monsieur Disney !!!
0	Not as good: I rented this game and I am glad that I didn't buy it right away. The game is too complicated and there were tons of glitches and i hated it. Bottom line, dont buy it!
1	The weakest of Jordan's series.: I believe this book had only one purpose -- to be a seg-way into the next. But where is the next? This novel lacks the exciting conclusion that I've come to expect. It ended so "wide open" that a reader can't help being frustrated. I hope that Mr. Jordan is alive and well, and will soon give us the novel that is two years coming. His novels have been a source of great enjoyment for me and I miss having a new one to read.
0	That's it...: After spending a lot of time with this series, I have finally given up on The Wheel of Time.Robert Jordan frustrates me. You spend more time reading about what the characters are thinking rather than actually getting any of the plot resolves. Furthermore, the story goes into POVs that really, REALLY don't need to be done.One would think that if you are this far in the series, you should have a broad knowledge of what's going on. But RJ does not think so. He goes on once again to describe every single city and enviroment again and again and again. I mean, how many times can you describe Tel'aran'rhiod?Sadly, I've given up and will no more force myself to finish these books. If you're looking for something fast-paced, something that will work your mind and not bore you with long descriptions about how some random hawk is flying around, then do not go any further.
0	Crown of Bores: I really enjoyed the first three books of the Wheel of Time. In fact I thought they were excellent. Book 5 was horrible, but Lord of Chaos (book 6) was another fine installment. Then we come to book 7. Truly pathetic. Looking for the tight writing and engaging style of the previous books? Looking for some real plot development and character growth? Then don't look at this book. Nothing happens. That's right, in a 700+ page book, nothing happens! The story doesn't move forward. It is filler material, nothing more. Robert Jordan should have been embarrassed to have ever seen this monstrosity go to print. I can only hope that future installments recapture the quality of past ones.
1	Another great adition to the Wheel of time series...: Some people will say this book is slow. Well it is only true for the slow minded. This book is an addition to the series in a more "fill-in-the-blanks" way. It is very good that he did it because sometimes you look back on a story and it just doesn't make any sense. -A very smart adition to the series.
0	To rest on one's laurals...: To rest on one's laurals is to write the later installments of the wheel of time series. I feel like I have been taken for a buggy ride... at my own expense. Stick to the earlier parts because they are something else.
1	I can go on with this forever: Robert Jordan is maybe one of the best authors I have ever read. From the first book to the seventh and soon eighth everyone was a wonder in itself. These books are filled with evergoing suspence,new and original theories,great fun and jokes and multicultural blend full of schemes,color,personalities... And I can go on for another hour, but then again,I probably don't have enough space for the full deal. I don't know what I'd do without RJ and I hope-I pray-that WOT won't ever come to an end.
1	Very enjoyable: Like the rest of the series. This book was gripping from the beginning to the end. Robert Jordon's Wheel of Time Seriers is the best I have read. It is more compelling than David Eddings "The Belgariad", and TOLKEN. p PLEASE keep up the writing and release the books a little quicker is possible
0	the beginning of the end: Indeed, this is the beginning of the end. Well, actually, no, the end began about two books ago in the series. The hope was, it would pick up again...it did not.Hey, in some ways this is the best one since the first two...because it's the shortest. But that's about the only good thing about it.
1	GGGGGRRRRREEEEEAAAAAATTTT: Finally a series of books that takes the time and does it properly. My feeling when I finished reading the Lord of the Rings was that it all finished too soon. Leaps are made, things just fall into place, characters suddenly learn what it is they're meant to do. Not so with these books. The characters are slowly coming into their own. Slowly learning their abilities and shaping their course. Brilliant. If the story is slow then it's as it should be, frustrating. It just makes it more worth while at the end of the day.
0	ARRGGHHHHHHHHHHHHH: At least I see that there are other readers as frustrated as I am. What started out as an epic, has become drawn out and almost painful to read. The last two books, which I bought in hard back so eager was I to continue the story, have left me feeling used. Is there an amount of books the publishers need Mr. Jordan to write? Mr. Jordan - go back to the first few books, reread them - enjoy them as much as I did and start writing properly again - let the story go on its own - stop holding it back. The series is losing fans - please restore my faith and bring me back.
1	Jordan is Awesome: This is by far the most gripping series of books I have ever read. I hope this series goes on FOREVER ! Kill off the Forsaken slowly....and bring back Moiraine-We miss her. I buy the hardback edition of each book and do not sleep until I have finished the book !! I have read these books over and over again....I love them
1	Should I or shouldn't I buy #7?: I went through much of the reviews for book #7 and it's pretty split between the pros and cons.I'm almost done with #6, and cannot decide if #7 would be worth reading. Maybe skipping it and jumping to #8? Any opinions? As a whole, I give the series (#1 - #6) an 8. That's it
1	The best fantasy series since Tolkien: I waited a long time for this book, and when I finally got my hands on it, it proved to be worth waiting for. I can understand those who think that nothing happens, but personally I don't care. The world and characters of Jordan becomes more and more alive for each book he writes. CoS isn't best of the books i the series but I still think it's great
1	music with soul: i am sick and tired of reading all these reviews that diss g. love and his sound. music critics desparately try and pigeon-hole him into a category with little sucess. i have heard him compared to acts as varied as beck and soul coughing. why don't people understand that this cd is just fun music that you can move to? i'm not trying to act like i know g. and what he is trying to do with his music, but i know i have a good time listening to this cd. so if you want to listen to something different from all the metal/rap combination groups and hear a fresh sound, buy this cd and get down.
0	Nice but short life: The device is nice, it allows to use your ps1 or ps2 controller (which I actually prefer) in the gamecube.The problem is it broke just 3 months after I bought it, so this isn't worth it, buy an original gamecube controller, or another adapter.
1	So many twists and turns: This is a fun film. You never know what will happen next or who the good guys are. Unlike most standard Hollywood films where you know who's the good guy, who's the bad guy and who's the damsel in distress, this film is full of clever shifts and turns and some very good acting.
0	Poorly Written: I admit that my programming experience is rather limited, but this book made me feel like a complete .... There is no denying that the author knows what he is writing about, but he does not convey that information in an easily understood manner. Unless you already know everything there is to know about RMI, networking and advanced Java programming, stay away from this book.
1	City of God: I received my order on time and in perfect condition. I would definately buy from this seller again.
0	Mold: Bought this book for class and the text was covered in mold. Working on trying to remove the mold now.
1	Pilot's Perspective: I like adventure books, especially those that deal with northern flying. This title clearly fell into that catagory. The autor gave us a perspective of the Iditarod race that only a pilot could. As a pilot who has flown in Alaska I found all of his flying information to be accurate. But best of all the book was very well written. The author has polished his work. The chapters are all very readable and fascinating. I would recommend this book to anyone whose interests run along the same lines as mine do; flying, Alaska, adventure and the Iditarod. My only complaint is a complete lack of pictures.
0	Presentation of concepts needs improvement: This booked is packed with information however the presentation needs vast improvement.Specifically the inclusion of a concept map at the beginning that gives a graphic view of hte concepts to be presented. Then concepts maps of each chapter's topics is necessary then. And if possible more concept maps for topics with in each chapter. These concepts would be more understandable with concept maps as graphic organizers of the information presented.
1	More blues and less rock on this one: Marcia is a fine singer who writes many of her own songs, though she is never afraid to record covers where they are suitable. Her albums can be almost relentlessly upbeat, as with Hot tamale baby, but this is generally a much sadder album - more like one would expect from a blues singer.Marcia still demonstrates her Jerry Lee-ish piano playing here, on the opening Red beans, the third track Down the road and particularly on her cover of Joe Ely's Fingernails, but those are not typical of this particular album.More typical is the title track, in which Marcia painted her house blue after her man left for good, or St Gabriel, about being sent to prison and later being released with nowhere to go.This is a fine album that demonstrates Marcia's ability to sing a variety of different types of song.
1	God bless you Jake: This book was our Brass Tech. textbook in college. It was great reading it and understanding so much. What helped was our professor had studied with Mr. Jacobs and had a little more insight. This book is very informative, but doesn't read like a text book. Highly recommend to any wind player or music educator.
1	Great game: Picture quality=5sound=3gameplay=4over all the only mess up is that the controls were to loose
1	soon to be the greatest guitar player ever.....great music!!: not as technical as his last cd but the music reflects exactly what the title is "undiscovered soul" Great job Richie, this cd is in my car all the time. Give us some more !!!!
1	Superb camera -- Buy it now!: I've used this camera now for 6 months and own 3, 5D bodies! I've used it with the following Canon lenses:24-70mm f/2.870-200mm f/2.885mm f/1.2200mm f/1.8300mm f/2.8I've shot EXTENSIVELY with all lenses WIDE OPEN and have not seen ANY vignettely indicated by a couple of other reviews. Are you kidding me? This thing is super sharp from center to edge.The full-frame censor comes in mighty handy when you need to crop and don't think this is an insignificant thing. If you can perfectly frame all your shots then maybe you don't need this capability.I would highly recommend this camera as the absolute be value out there in a DSLR regardless of brand.
1	Cute: These shoes are better than I expected. They are adorable and decent enough quality, considering the price. They are a little tight in the toe and I have narrow feet, or so I thought. I went up a size since I fall on a half size normally. I would HIGHLY recommend that others do the same to make the toe more comfortable. Otherwise, they are easy enough to walk in, very cute, and fairly comfortable.
1	Great Time shoe!: I love to go out and dress up with these shoes on! They are pretty comfortable and fun!
1	Halloween Shoes: Perfect for many costumes and not all that uncomfortable. Very happy with the product and price!
0	Rent before you Buy: What a bad movie. Pitch Black was great but this mess doesn't even come close. The only reason I'm giving it two stars is because I didn't watch the entire movie. I fell asleep half way thru this bomb and didn't want to waste another 3 bucks renting this a 2nd day to finish it.
1	Worth it: Surprisingly, this was my introduction to the Riddick series. Watching this led me to Pitch Black, a truly great film. It's true, the Chronicles storyline is skeletal, but the action keeps the pace moving along so there isn't a great deal of time to wonder "why...?" Its not until after the film that thoughtful reflection reveals how thin the plot is. The ending was a surprise, which is a pleasure in this era of movie-making. The special effects are stunning and believable, an especially impressive feat with Sci-Fi films. Vin Diesel is great. Granted, he doesn't need alot of range for the role, but he makes the most out of it. His marvelous voice conveys as much nuance as character development allows, and his physique is impressive. He really is deft at conveying feeling (or lack thereof) through body language. Actually, the action films I own are for watching while I exercise, and this is one I have watched more than once and will undoubtably watch again. Its a good specimen of its' genre.
0	hm: I would say that the only thing less interesting than the movie itself were the special features included in the disk.Ok, there were definitely some cool action scenes. However, there was little to no character development. The story and subplots seemed to have been ripped off from a bunch of other stories (including the prophecy and the killing of the sons--read mythology much?). The motivations of the characters seemed somewhat random and irrelevant.This dvd was given to me as a gift. I would have never purchased it myself (had I seen the movie). I think this movie is worth watching once, and that's about it. No point to owning it.
1	yes!: this is the best movie I've ever seen. the story is great and the actors couldn't have been chosen any better. I love u vin diesel!
0	Tied with White Chicks for worst Movie of 2004: How many science fiction and fantasy cliches can you put in a movie? Just watch Riddick and start counting. I seriously think this should have been a parody of sci-fi and fantasy because this movie is THAT BAD. Pitch Black was great but for this "sequel" they basically rewrote the Riddick character to fit into this jumbled mess of a movie. The acting was laughable. The story was ridiculous and it stole from movies like Star Wars, Star Trek, LOTR, Escape from New York, forget about it. I don't want to continue listing because I think you should get the point. Don't waste any $$$ or time on tis steaming pile of crap. You might as well call Vin Diesel's career dead or on the same level as Seagal and Van Damme. Straight to cable and DVD.
1	Beautiful butterfly book: I loved the book because of the beautiful color pictures,small size, soft cover, information on the butterflies.It would be more informative if it had the small United States mapshowing each type of butterflies range. I only need info on Minnesota butterflies at this time.
1	Audubon Society Field Guides: Audubon Society Field Guides make great gifts for children and adults. I often give the books as gifts along with bird houses and bug houses. I always make sure that everyone knows that they should never kill any wildlife that is outside in our big world. I love my own collection of these books.
1	Peterson's is better: This one comes in second. It's definitely for the amateur and is very nicely illustrated. My main beef is it requires too much page flipping and the organization is poor. The one I prefer in the field is Peterson's. It's more pocket sized and quicker for reference use.
0	TOO OLD: It was last revised in 2002, that's twelve years ago. Need I say more for such a fluid topic. oNE MORE WORD.
0	slow and repetitious: Having made it to page 88, reading through several repetitions and reminders of character's abilities or facts, I began to wonder whether this would continue. So, I flipped to page 336 and picked up from that point without skipping a beat...or boredom. Needless to say, I did not finish this book--didn't even care who dunit. 2 stars for making it to page 88 and not putting it down sooner.
1	one of my favs: This one of my favorite books of Chris'. I have read them all and can't wait for the next one to come out. He's a great story teller and has a great duo in Jon and David to carry from book to book. Exact.
0	Don't even bother with this one: It it wern't for Russell Crowe, this would have been a complete failure. The plot takes place in a fictional country in Latin America. The main conflict of the movie is that Meg Ryan's husband gets kidnapped by gorillas. Throughout the movie he is abused, denied of a shave or a shower, and is put to rotten work. Russell Crowe is the man in charge of working out a deal with the gorillas to free Ryan's husband. At the same time there is a sexual tension brewing between Meg Ryan and Russell Crowe. In my opinion, it is pretty pathetic that Meg Ryan would show interest in another man while her husband is in captivity by hostile gorillas. The whole movie is really bad, Meg Ryan is a just terrible, the only good part is the action seen at the end, but it doesn't quite save the movie.
0	Nice but: I saw this movie about four times on a transatlantic flight yesterday (well I really watched it only once...) and I found it somewhat entertaining but not really exciting. Maybe that's a good thing. The drama side was refreshingly life-like (too bad it doesn't cater for today's scandal-hungry soap opera audience).On the other hand, the action side was a disappointment. Sure there was thrilling suspense and bullets and fire and blood, but the outcome was not very realistic. It was almost as bad as "The Saint." It was nice entertainment though -- I wish they could rig every war and other sports event the same way.
0	So So Movie: This movie had decent ratings on imdb. I wanted to see an action flick with a mix of thriller. This movie was ok and that exciting. All this have going for it is Russell Crowe.
1	Very Realistc: Although it takes a little while to get rolling, this movie was surprisingly realistic. It was well done, and has a VERY tense scene near the end, which really makes the whole movie worth while.
1	Superman like you've never seen before: You like superman? You like Russians? The. Put them together and you will get a great story of a world that could have been... A must have for any serious comic collecter
0	Shallow vision of Socialism. Mediocre at best: Red Son is awful in his superficiality. What could've been a very beautiful statement about mankind, economy and Super-powers ended basically just as another regular Superman story, just with him using another black suit. There is nothing in Red Son about a communist Superman or about Comunism itself. It's just another mediocre Superman story throwing just bits of uneducated and biased ideas and giving hints of him dating WW (who cares about that?).Worse than that, the format make the issues so large they become tiring to read. The cover art is beautiful, but the rest inside it really sucks.
1	One of the better Disney films of the1980s.: Full of adventure and mystery, in this film, Disney takes a slightly more sophisticated turn and the outcome is really enjoyable. The film has really nice animation especially the scene atop Big Ben. The voice talent is great, especially the dastardly Vincent Price. The villain is good, and very malicious and powerful. The DVD is really good as well. The movie is in a new letterbox treatment- very nice. I highly reccomend this film for anyone who loves the Disney film genre.
0	It stinks: All of the spooky characters of the original Sherlock Holmes, but none of the charm. Dont get this movie for little ones!!!!
1	MANKIND'S GREATEST ACHIEVEMENT: When the aliens land in my backyard, and they come to me and they say "Earthling, tell us what is the greatest single thing you Earth people have ever accomplished so that we may document your planet's contribution to the Universe" that's when I will hand them my copy of 'Apocalypse Now' and humbly say "here"
1	Very good movie: A Very good movie, well dispatched in time. The blu ray box bore few bumps on each sides certainly because of the handling
1	Great movie!!!!: Godfather director and great cast. Besides the known big names in the movie, there are smaller appearances by a young Harrison Ford, Laurence Fishburne, Dennis Hopper and a great cameo by the man that changed Rock n Roll- Bill Graham.
1	this isn't a bubble gum, shoot'em up movie...: this movie requires intelligence to piece together Coppola's masterpiece. this movie is at stanley kubrick quality. even the way the Door's "The End" weaves throughout the movie deserves 5 stars... How could someone say that the ending is weak? It ISN'T VISUAL! It should blow you away mentally... if it doesn't, it went over your head. This movie is very quotable too.
0	Poor DVD quality: I love this movie but the quality of the DVD is very poor. towards the end the DVD stops and starts several times which is very annoying.
0	You really have to be kidding me.....: I'm sorry but I just don't get it.This is a long movieThis is a boring movieI could never understand why people got so into this flick. I find it a great chore to sit through.
0	I wanted to turn this disc into a coaster...: It may be a classic to many people, but only sheer will and determination allowed me to sit through it. It was horrible. It was long, boring, and pointless. The director intended this film to showcase the different facets of war and the madness that it brings to some people. I should've known the madness was intended for his audience.The story is about Captain Willard (Martin Sheen) on a mission to find and execute the highly decorated and brilliant renegade Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando), who has turned mad (undoubtedly because of war).Please don't waste 3 hours of your life watching this movie.LEAP rating (each out of 5):============================L (Language) - 3 (writers get all philosophical and artsy with Brando's lines)E (Erotica) -0 (n/a)A (Action) - 2 (doesn't force you to the edge of your seats, that's for sure)P (Plot) -1 (Sheen is sent into Cambodia to hunt down Brando, plain and simple)
0	BORING, BAD ACTING, NOT REALISTIC, AWFUL: This movie is not worth seeing. Don't waste your time, and go for the newer productions. In the time the movie was made they certainly did not know what they were doing.
0	New BluRay: Great movie but I could not play it on my Oppo blu-ray player....and the Internet chat rooms are full of problems with this version. It simply won't play. Dec 2011
0	Don't let the packaging fool you!: I own all 3 apocalypse now's (original, redux, and this)I must say that I have become more and more disappointed as I went down the line.Original version (1979) on DVD contains everything that was meant to be there, just no impressive multimedia or extras.Redux came along and made some desirable but mostly undesirable tweaks to the original.THE VERSION YOU ARE BUYING is in my mind a total rip off to anyone who owns the redux and or original!!!I advise anyone who doesn't own apocalyse now on dvd to go ahead and buy it, BUT IF YOU DO OWN THEM save your money!!!
0	Two stars for redux five for the original: Let me begin with saying that apocalypse now is one of my all time favorite movies so i was excited when i saw that they had rereleased it and then i saw in and now know why the scenes included in this version were deleted in the first place, because they take away from the continuity of the story line to me they became a destraction and towards the end were just plain annoying. You cannot improve on perfecton as this DVD proves so save some money and just buy the original.
1	Another Coppola Masterpiece: Indeed Apocalypse Now is one of Francis Ford Coppola's masterpieces, along with The Godfather and The Godfather Part 2. Probably one of the movie industry's best war films ever, Coppola's vision of the Vietnam War is unlike any war movie I've ever seen. It truly showed the horrors of the war and the young soldiers who became crazy over the fact they had to be brought into Vietnam without experience. Ranking #28 in AFI's100 movies of all-time, I believe it fits the right place. I now can't wait to see Hearts of Darkness: A Film Maker's Apocalypse. And one more thing: Marlon Brando couldn't have performed his part any better.
1	Haunting Film, Semi-Dissapointing Disc: The first time I saw Apocalypse Now for my 9th grade Vietnam War project I knew I had seen something special, but was left saying "huh?" Upon furthur viewing and reading the book it was based on It's becoming a little less hazy, but it's a film I'll be watching over and over again just to get underneath all those layers of the story. The film is topped with great performances my Martin Sheen and Robert Duvall. The other actors in the film are also great. The cinematography is excellent and the great transfer does not dissapoint. The sound is pretty good, but it could've used a little more bass. Overall the sound and video are great, but it's the lack of extras that dissapointed me. Although you do get the napalming of Kurtz's compound with or without commentary, that's about it for extras. A Francis Ford Coppola commentary for the film might've been nice. Oh well. Overall it's a disc well worth purchasing.
1	The greatest war film in history: It puts "Full Metal Jacket" and "Platoon" in the shade. This is easily the best Vietnam film and the greatest war film ever. It topically transfers the setting of Joseph Conrad's epic novella "Heart of Darkness" from the Congo to Vietnam, although it leaves the story, themes and characters relatively intact. Marlon Brando offers an intimidating and overpowering performance. The impact he exerts in the film is profound, even though his face remains in shadow for the most of the duration of his appearance. A classic of the now outdated genre of Vietnam films.
1	''this is the end..'': astonishing film,great performances,the story of Nam,''the end''was or is like that..Brando was''god''..
1	Good classic: This album made earth wind and fire a pop group. Shining Star, That's the way of the world and reasons are hot. However, the songs are just as good.
1	EWF is still the best.: I listened to this album as a high school student and am happy to have the remastered CD in my possesion. See the Light is still my favorite song, however this entire album is in my opinion EWF's 2nd best (All 'n All being my favorite) There does not exist today this kind of musicianship and talent in a band.
1	Greatest of All Time: This, put very simply, is the greatest recording of all time. The opening riffs of "Shining Star" followed by the explosion of the horns signals the birth of a musical world the likes that have never been duplicated. The seamless edits between songs and the small interludes lets the journey flow without interruption. The incredibly tight music of the band coupled with Maurice White and Phillip Bailey's vocals are unmatched, especially on "That's the Way of the World," the best cut on the CD. "Reasons" still never fails to unite lovers to this day. The best thing to do is just grab a bottle of wine, hit play, and let it go from start to finish. It never fails to satisfy.
1	Mortal Kombat Trilogy the bomb?: MKT is really a great game! It takes all of the best features from MK1-3 and translates them flawlessly onto the Playstation platform. This allows die-hard fans like me to play it without the Sega or SNES. However there are two glitches that kind of bother me. One is the fatalities. Sub-Zero's old rip of the head is cut out, and there is no ice grenade to name a few problems. The second is the difficulty level. No matter if you chose Easy and Novice for the tournament, the computer will tear you up in less than 30 seconds once you get up toward the end of the latter! Even if you are Kintaro, Shao Kahn will destroy you. I still haven't beat it. Other than that for [price], it is definently worth it. :)
1	Mortal Kombat!!!: Personally I think that this is the last of the good Mortal Kombats, I don't really kare too much for the one's with all the weapons plus the kombos were Killer in this one. I just like some of the kharacters from the new. I'm glad someone still has this game around. I only have too complaints it seems to freeze up after a 2 player game is done, therefore you have to reset it and the whole Shang Tsung loading thing, other than that I enjoy it and it brings back teenage memories.
1	if color doesnt matter this is for you: Fits perfect just a taupe color but it was cheaper to get this color than to get black. We needed for an extra vehicle so it worked perfectly.
0	Elevator Bensusan.: Yuk. Not because of Pierre Bensusan's efforts. In fact i respect and understand his attempt to try something a bit different. The problem is, I just dont like this kind of music.This is not solo guitar with some vocals like his other albums, this is fully produced, jazzy-mainstream new agey music. It would work well in an office or elevator setting.NOT the heart felt solo guitar chops and vocal genius that his other recordings capture. If you get the pleasure of listening to any of his other albums, you will think its an entirely different musician. This is so different, i have to say its Pierre Bensusan, "NOT"!I reccomend ANY other album by Bensusan, besides this one. Unless, of course, you enjoy mild, new-agey, jazz instrumental albums...if thats the case then you may like it.
1	This has been my absolute favorite movie since i saw it: This is movie fosuses on an11 year old girl's life.she has no mother, and her father works in a funeral home.having only a dad and living in a funeral parlor is only part of Vada's problems. she is absolutely sure she is going die and her only friend is Thomas J. Vada's life begins to turn around after her dad meets Brenda, who, little by little, helps Vada cope with life and death.
1	My favourite move EVER!: This movie is good too the end! It shows the uncertainties of being a young girl, and the troubles of having growing up and having a father remarry, etc. Anna Chlumsky does an excellent job in this movie, and Macaulay Culkin plays a very convincing best friend. This movie will make you laugh and make you cry!
1	She is Strange, but She Has Great Talent.: This is very....interesting CD. She sings about common things but she doesn't make them sound common. She makes them alternative and what a real alternative CD should be about. Her song "I Try" is great along with "Sexomatic Venus Freak," "I Can't Wait to Meetchu," and "Why Didn't You Call Me." These songs will turn out to be great hits and some already have. This is a great value for such a great CD.
0	Let Down: I heard a lot of people talking up this album on the Grammy's so I bought after hearing only the too much played cut" I try". I have to agree with one of the other reviewers about dragging some black girl off the shreets to prop up in front of a mike. I miss spelled streets similar to spelling "you" "chu" . Come on folks this is not even audable english. I bought Tracy Chapmans new one at the same time and WHAT a contrast. Macy Grey is going to the used dc store.
1	Talking all night long: I sat up all night. I talk to this beautiful lady I met all night long while this, and a few other few slow jams played.. I can tell you if you are in the mood to sip wine, talk about life, and get closer to someone toss this cd on the spinner, and open your mind. If you want to hear something that is close, goto mp3, look up "d.a. young" and listen to "father's father's house." You will not be sorry. =)
1	Macy Gray is one of the best: I loved that song I TRYED and the rest is really good too. I am looking forward to buying her album
0	Puh-lease!: I can't turn my radio fast enough when I hear "I Try" coming on. It's like a car wreck. You don't want to see it, you have to turn forcefully away, and if you do see it it will haunt you. Her voice is ABOMINABLE, like fingernails on a chalkboard. The fact that anyone likes her is more proof that if you're just over-the-top horrible, some people will take it as a sign of greatness. Get Biz Markie as your vocal coach, have some songs written professionally for you, and you too could be a star.
1	Gray Matters: This is a strong, unique debut from such a super talent. Macy Gray growls with that she-ra soul, that Tina-Earth-Kitt, lazy groove Billie Holiday in a funked out, disco-ready, rhymthic blues sorta way. Macy may not be for everyone but that doesn't mean this sista is a one hit wonder. With the radio play of superifical, dry, booty songs, Macy Gray is a refreshing taste for those who want to hear some soul. For those who wanna hear that skreeching voice that sounds almost unreal, possibly surreal. This is for those who wanna expand in what they call music. Who don't pry themselves by the standards of what is current and pop. This for those who want something with spice, class, sass, and appeal. Macy Gray soars with her brand of old-school remixed with new school funk. That neo-funk, that makes your favorite 70's albums proud.
0	Turkey Rather Than One Star:: What's wrong with Hollywood? Just like the pure idea alone of Silence of the Limbs would amaze you well enough, the idea of this movie will, oppositely, sicken you all the way. Remember The Watcher (badly enough in its own rights), would be a classic comparing with this one.I am still confused why good actors like these two would take on a project like this. After two hours of viewing, not only careful consideration of choosing future title is needed, but also watching some boxing just to drive away the disgust this movie left.
0	the dishwasher !!: I could tolerate most of the illogical anguished drama (hell, I could forgive Charlize Theron anything), but then they lost me completely with the dishwasher!!
0	Pretty much what you'd expect: I was marginally curious about this film when I saw the trailer, but definitely unwilling to pay to view it. Fortunately, it came on HBO while I was staying in a hotel, and I could watch for free. It was largely what I expected - fairly worthless. Keanu Reeves performed better than he historically has, but Charlize Theron was fairly flat. Though the premise was marginally interesting, the plot is completely predictable. One bright spot was Jason Isaacs as Chaz/Cherry, who delivers his usual caliber of excellence. It did jerk the obligatory tear from me at the end, but that's largely because I'm easy that way. Four yawns and two stars.
0	Have no interest in it: I just got this for my class and I just not interested about other people. I'm more interested in creating things than reading about it.
0	Help your Dog Fight Cancer: This is the most informative book I've ever read on the subject. Also a very moving story which I will read over and over again!The info on veterinarians, oncologists and web-sites is incredable!A MUST buy, also for those whose dogs do NOT have cancer.
1	great camera: a great camera to take with you every day takes great pictures and takes up no room in your pocket
1	Best game I've ever played: If you like video games this game is a must have. It features awesome graphics and is 3D. If you can get only one game for your Game Cube get this one!!!Pacman has always been my favorite game except it has been in 2D this is the1st Pacman Game I've Played that is actually in 3D!!!VERY long game that takes weeks to beat!!!tHE BOTTOM LINE IS TO BUY THIS GAME!!!
0	The movie was positively dreadful: I didn't have high hopes for this film, seeing how it was a bomb at the box office. Now I know why. Seems they put a lot of money into effects and then just let Will Ferrell and Danny McBride kinda improv through the entire thing. They miss more than they hit, that's for sure. I imagine if you were sitting a room of half drunk frat boys, it'd be hilarious, but I barely cracked a smile through the whole thing. It's unfortunate also that the old series was family oriented and this is barely one step below R-rated humor. Skip this film (like most people did when it came out) and rent the original series instead.
0	Maybe the worst movie I've ever seen: Land of the Lost stars Will Ferrell, as Rick Marshall, a scientist. It was so bad, I left the theater 20 minutes into it. First off, what's up with the cheesy special effects? (aliens) I guess that's supposed to be funny, but it's not. Right before I walked out, a dinosaur was running after them, and they stoped to take a picture, so that they had proof, of this new world. Yeah. I will tell you straight up that I'm not a Will Ferrel fan, so maybe this wasn't for me. But this is so utterly dull, uninteresting, boring, and idiotic, that I couldn't even watch it.
0	... really?: Will Ferrell has been in some hilariously wonderful movies. Elf, Talladega Nights, Blades of Glory... but this movie is NOT one of them. It was just... holy mother of god! Yes, this movie was supposed to be funny... but it failed on pretty much every level. The acting is awful and so is the writing. The only reason I saw this was because it was playing on TV several nights ago, and I am glad I did not pay to see it.
0	stay away from this movie: I have seen many movies,and I am a huge Will Ferrel fan.Will got paid too much in this "piece of c--p" movie. There wasn't any plot. The story was all over the place. They threw in some dinosaurs, and a pool scene. Why sit around and watch junk, you will thank me later that you passed this stupid movie up. If you want to see Will in the only good movie he has made. See Stranger Than Fiction. Even his most recent movie was a flop. I consider a flop when you experience "forced laughter". The recent movie I am mantioning is The Other Guys. take care and happy viewing.
0	Warped tale should get lost and stay there: Short Attention Span Summary (SASS):1. Bad dialogue2. Bad acting3. Bad script4. Bad movie - bad, bad movie!Need I say more?Ferrell and company lamely limp their way through this uninspired big screen version of a seventies' TV series.So horrid are the dialogue and plot that this movie makes Brendan Fraser's "Journey to the Center of the Earth" look like a National Geographic special.The end result of watching this tale of a time-warp -adventure-gone-stupid is a splitting headache from trying to keep your eyebrows in your head.This is one that should remain lost.Amanda Richards, September19, 2009
0	Two hours of my life wasted: If you are a fan of the original TV series you will be sorely disappointed. This movie bears little resemblance to the TV show other than character names and some sleestak. If you are not familiar with the TV series and have no expectations then you might find it mildly entertaining if you have a "simple" sense of humor. But anyone with more than half a brain is likely to consider this movie really dumb.
0	Horrible! Absolutly horrible! Worst movie ever!: Horrible, stupid, its Will Ferril's best yet! This was the DUMBEST movie we have EVER seen(even worse than Freedom State)!!! Don't waste your money! Will Ferril is an amazingly stupid actor. If you have a brain the size of a walnut you will enjoy this movie!(If your brain is any bigger please do not watch, it will destroy your brain cells)My IQ is now 60...it used to be125.
0	Terrible and a waste of time and money: This is the worst movie you will ever watch...no plot, no story, terrible casting and nothing to do with the original series. Ugh. It sucks.
0	1 star =1 laugh: this movie was terrible. the dialog seemed as if it was written by a high school student, the plot devices were more than contrived, they were ridiculous. there was1 good laugh in this movie. it was such a poorly made movie i had no desire to watch the extra features. i just wanted to get the dvd out of my player. thank god i rented this piece of garbage instead of buying it.if you liked the first one, you may like this. i thought the first one was marginally funny. i personally think i'm too intelligent for this movie. the humor was soporific and generally appeals to the LCD in everyone. it just so happens my LCD is way above most people Highest Common Denominator.whatever.
1	A VERY FUNNY SEQUEL TO AMERICAN PIE!: I got a VCD of this movie from my friend (which was in terrible quality) and thought it was hilarious. I even invited a couple of girl friends over to watch it with me, and they liked it. I of course saw the R-Rated version and thought it was good. But now I have seen the Unrated version and it is 6 minutes funnier! Altogether this is an awesome DVD to own, with10 hours of bonus features and it looks great in the full-frame format. I can't wait to own this movie!
1	A Better Pie: American Pie 2 was an excellent sequel to the first American Pie movie. The story is pretty simple. Everyone's now in College, and for the Summer Vacation, the guys try to make it the best one Ever!To me AP2 is even better than the first. American Pie contained more of the everyday sexual encounters that teenage comedies now have. When I saw the first movie I wasn't really up for it because I already knew what was going to happen (except for the bedroom part). But, For American Pie 2, I was really surprised that even though it still had sexual situations (which I thought was even funnier that the first) it also had heart.It really made me realise that the characters have grown up and are taking things a bit more seriously. From their relationship with friends and family.This Second Pie is totally a must-see to anyone who's seen the first.
0	this cant be happening: I cant believe that a sequel came out for american piesame tasteless humorsame story linesame starssame everythingthis is just another attempt by filmakers to make high schoolers think that when they go to "college" its going to be one beer guzzling party after another and they will get through their first year with flying colorsI know this because it brainwashed a buncha of students at my school, always trying to get laid, into parties and how much they will enjoy their "freedom" in collegebad movie
1	Hilarious!: Irreverant comedy at its finest! The sequel was better than the original, and I loved the original! The actors were great, but I was really impressed with Alyson Hannigan in this flick. She was able to make her band geek character funny and deep. I noticed that she appeared in more of the outtakes than any other actor/actress. I look forward to seeing more of her work. This is on my greatest comedy list forever!
1	Fusion jazz gem from the masters: This hard to find CD is a must for fans of fusion jazz. The groundbreaking quartet of Chick Corea, Stanley Clarke, Al DiMeola, and Lenny White provide the true fusion of rock and jazz with the hard driving "Earth Juice" and "Vulcan World". And then the solo piano of the title tune provides a surpassingly sweet moment of peace. Along with their classic Romantic Warrior and Weather Report's "Heavy Weather" this CD is a classic of early-mid-70's fusion jazz.
0	This DVD has not been released yet: Despite what it says on hmv.ca - the title Deceived has not been received. I ordered it two months ago and was just informed that I wouldnt get it until late January - little do they know that hmv.com says the release is Feb14/04. Why dont they figure it out and change the availability - it will not ship in 2-6 weeks cause it doesnt exist! yet.
0	More like The Snore.: OK, it's Corman so you gotta cut him some slack, but this one couldn't terrify a tourist in Disneyland. Karloff is you're typical SOB--Scary Old Baron; Nicholson's a miscast as a lovestruck Napoleanic officer (French lieutenant? Stick to LA gumshoe, Jake.); and what about that Community Theater witch?! Maybe they should have burned the sets down while filming--a la Gone with the Wind--in order to add some excitement to this one.
0	A caveat to DVD purchasers: WARNING to anyone thinking of purchasing the D-Vision DVD edition of THE TERROR: It is not the letterbox edition touted in Amazon's writeup (my sole reason for ordering it). REPEAT: It is not widescreen; it is in full-screen format, and appears to have been mastered from an EP VHS source.
1	Humourous Insight: Potpourri of life is a poetic and humourous look in the problems that so many of us face in our everyday lives. When is the second book coming?
0	Leave your brain and taste at the door: "Danger Kitty" has mass produced some of the worst music in the history of Pop. To all of the BJ fans out there, look up the word, "cliche". Understand its danger and the shallow nature that this word connotes. It's ahem !! like a "wet, slippery, loaded gun". If you're going to write lyrics this horrible, juvenile and unimaginative, why bother finishing Junior High at all. Drop out of school, get yourself a job at Hot Dog on a Stick and say goodbye to every one of your brain cells. Patriotism demands that you rid your CD player of anything that makes you look like you couldn't finish the 4th grade. Do it for your country!
0	So incredibly overrated..: Bon Jovi are in close competition with Nirvana for the "Most Overrated Band in History" award. If I had a dollar for every time I heard the cr@ppy "Living on a Prayer" played on the radio, I'd be able to retire in comfort, and I'm only 21! I can only reccommend this album to people who like to annoy themselves with $hitty music.
0	Wow was this bad!: I just got back from seeing this terrible, terrible movie and felt the need to share my feelings in a review. Nothing about this movie was enjoyable. From the opening scene with the crowd of the jousting match singing We Will Rock You, I knew I was in trouble. There should surely be a rule about using 70s rock anthems in movies about jousting that are set before1970, or for any movies about jousting. I now understand why there have been so few jousting movies out, because it's boring. Once you see one person get knocked off their horse, you've seen it all. This movie is acted horribly, written horribly, and directed horribly. Save your money and go buy a best of 70s Rock compilation album instead.
0	Ridiculous!: This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Heath Ledger, as a lead actor, is terrible. In fact, all the actors in this movie are extremely bad. The story is poor and ridiculous. On the other side, if it had not been for a movie like this one, we would not be able to fully appreciate a good movie. Therefore, take my advice- do not rent this movie! It goes without saying that this movie deserves much criticism as there are many flaws and shortcomings. In conclusion, if you see this movie I can assure you that you will be disappointed.
1	Don't buy the "Extended" Edition!: If you're a fan of Brian Helgeland, Paul Bettany (Chaucer), or just commentary tracks in general, don't buy the extended edition. The regular DVD has every feature the "extended" edition does - it just doesn't insert the deleted scenes into the movie. They're included as bonus features. This extended edition does not include the hilarious and insightful commentary track by Helgeland and Bettany, which is really the best thing about the DVD. You get more features for less money by buying the regular DVD release.
0	Save Your Money: This movie ranks right next to Red Tomahawck as one of the worst movie I have seen. The acting is not bad but the story was as cliche ridden as the fifth sequeal to a Rocky movie. You see better stories in old Tarzan movie's. How many time's can you watch a knight get struck while riding a horse. Heath Ledger is the Babe Ruth of knight's. There are no odd's he cannot overcome and man those he overcome the odd's. Superman better watch out. Now if Sylvester Stallone was a knight then you would have a contest. Give your money to a charity or pay off an old debt and avoid this rubbish.
1	The Best: I saw this movie and LOVED IT!!!! It was the best ever. The soundtrack is really good too. The characters are well delveloped. In my opinion it is a football movie but with horses and lances. This is my all time favorite movie!
1	Rock and Roll Jousting: The soundtrack is a character all its own in this film. This is the story of a poor young boy who grows up in the shadow of a jousting champion, who like all champions must one day face the fact that he can no longer be the best.The boy's father is his hero, even though he basically sells him into servitude. He tells his son he can change his destiny, that nothing should stand in his way.This boy lives by those words. This is a typical story of society boundaries and poor boy meets rich girl. With the added character of classical rock and roll matched with medieval backdrop, you'll sit rivoted to your seat anticipating the realistic jousting matches and playing name that tune!
0	Drivel: OK, what a waste of time, don't get me wrong I love horror movies just as much as the next fiend, but this one takes the cake for stupidity. How can you make a horror movie that is so utterly devoid of suspence? I feel sorry for teens who think that today's horror movies are actually scary, they should check out Hallaween and Friday the13th to see how it's really done. I guarantee that if they saw Michael Myers or Jason delivering spine shattering blows upon thier victims and death from above they would change their tunes.
0	Nobody want's to be this Mama's boys Valentine.: Your typical, average, unoriginal masked man killing off people that he doesn't like. Not only that, People that don't like him. That don't love him. This whole things has been done to death and I'm sick of it. Enough with the killer's in masks. Many others have come before this one. Some where more entertaining than others but still, give it a rest already. Nothing is done different and everything is flawed in this movie. It's a complete waste of time.Here's a list of all the others that seem EXACTLY similiar to this undying tune:1. I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER2. I STILL KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER3. SCREAM4. SCREAM 25. SCREAM 36. HIGHSCHOOL DEATH7. THE ENTIRE JASON VORHEES SERIES8. THE ENTIRE MICHAEL MEYERS SERIES9. URBAN LEGEND10. URBAN LEGENDS: FINAL CUTfINAL vERDICT: This deserves to be forgotten.
1	The best moddern day horror film of them all!: Let me start out by saying that this movie will make the easily scared piss their pants! The origionality of this film is so hard to come by these days. When a group of attractive young girls humiliate a nerd at the valentines day dance, he vows revenge on all of them.13 years later they recieve thretening valentines and gifts. The gift that Jessica Cauffiel's character Lily gets will make the squeamish throw up! Anyway, One by one they are hunted down by a crazed killer wearing a cupid mask. Very creative death scenes including arrows, power drills, shards of glass, axes and more. Great soundtrack too! I rate it an A+! Stars Denise Richards, Marly Shelton, Jessica Cauffiel, Jessica Capshaw, Kathrine Heigel, Hedy Burress and David Boreanza.
0	Tom Savage should sue: This is possibly the worst book to movie transition I have ever seen. Whereas the book was a five star thriller, the movie is just another cheap slasher film with absolutely nothing to redeem it from the crap that it is. I have been disappointed many times by movies made from books I have read, but never on this grand a scale. Tom Savage has written only a handful of books, but they are all edge-of-your-seat thrillers, so I was very excited to hear "Valentine" was being made into a movie. And if it had been made properly it would have been good. Instead, a horrible script in the hands of a truly terrible director turned this masterpiece into a shameful mess. I urge everyone who saw this movie and hated it as much as I did to read the book. It is nothing like the movie. In fact I recently reread the book and realized, with the exception of the title, the book is an entirely different story. If you have not seen the movie, don't waste your time, read the book instead.
0	This game sucks: Yes, the graphics are goods but this game sucks big time. I rented it and I'm glad thats all I did.Tip to the people who are considering on buying this game, rent it first because you don't want to get stuck with this game.
0	HUH>?: I rented this game expecting some fast and furious gameplay, the truth is, is that thats all you get. No statistics or roster changes!!!! Thats a major blow, besides that it has dumb gimics like when you have to play against a team of dolphins... WHY??? I recommend renting it first, the graphics are the only good thing about it, all you do is play play play, it gets pretty redundant and boring after a while, with no stats or rosters to look at.
0	Extremly desapointing!!: I first read "Kane & Abel" also by J. Archer, this one book was so good that even though I know that second parts are not as good as first parts I wanted to read it.This turn out to be an incredibly disapointing book, so much that I had to make a huge effort to keep reading and dont put the book on the trash.More than half of the book only repeats what we already knew from "Kane & Abel", and the rest was just the worst plot ever.How can someone writte so well first and then just be the worst writter ever?I just regret to have buy this book in the first place.
0	Soap opera: This is a soap opera. If you enjoy reading about romanticized daily life you will no doubt find this book interesting.I was expecting an action novel. It isn't here. I waded through about half the book and then gave up. I just could not maintain any interest in the continueing lives of Florentyna and Richard.I'm sure they went on to even greater fame and fortune...I just don't care.
1	Recommendation with Enthusiasm: Before reaching the end of this novel, it had already moved into the position of being one of my favorite books of all time. It is engaging from the first page until the final sentence. I could not put it down. This is the type of book that makes you want to read everything else the author has written, because if any of his other books even come close to this they will be amazing. For anyone looking to read this I would definitely recommend reading Kane and Abel beforehand. The two novels complement each other very well, and you cannot have the complete story if you only read one.
0	Lost interest after the hot tub scene.: This movie had plenty of laughs, but I lost all interest after the two naked men pull owen wilson from the hot tub. Could have totally done without seeing that. If you can overlook that scene then I guess it was an alright move, maybe 31/2 stars.
0	Since When Does ONE Deleted Scene = "Special Features?": If you loved this movie and want the DVD for the outrageous special features you can't get on rental DVDs - outtakes, bloopers, commentary, interviews, behind the scenes, etc - DON'T BOTHER! The "special features" (which I can't believe they had the nerve to make plural) include ONE deleted scene. ONE. Why even bother??? Save yourself some money and buy a previous rental copy. Note to the studio: if you're planning a "special edition" in the future with all these features in the hopes of getting my money twice...it's not happening.
1	Great purchase: I chose to buy this during the Black Friday deals weekend and it's a great purchase! This was a great purchase!
1	Good Movie,: Seen this with my girl friend and she wanted the movie for ever. We ordered this and it showed up the same day as it was released.
0	Not as funny as I expected: This movie fails on many levels to deliver on what I expected to be a much funnier outing for Wilson. The movie falls down on humor and really overall quality. Don't get me wrong - there are some funny moments but they are few and further between than I would have liked. I didn't like the characters enough to care what happened to them and I didn't believe what happened to them when it did happen. The blonde is not believable and she is unlikely as the realistic sexual interest for Owen Wilson (unless he is OWEN WILSON - ACTOR and not the character in the movie).This is not a movie that I will watch again. Better than Bad Teacher - MUCH MUCH MUCH worse than Wedding Crashers (my benchmark film in this genre).
0	a very disappointing movie.: whats up with hollywood? what a big disappointment. I want watch another movie that Peter Farrelly directs or if he's even is involved with it.
0	Sucked: Some funny parts here and there, but mostly sucked. It definitely wasn't worth paying to watch, I wouldn't watch it again, but if you could get it free, it might be ok.
1	HIGHEST Recommendation: I loved every word of this book. Knock your socks off story, rich characters, and as about as relevant as you can possibly get. Will now go read more of this writer's books and hope their half as good.
1	Best of a Classic: He may be old, but this is an exceptionally rockin slab of fun. One of the outstanding rockers of all time successfully translates his live show to the studio. Every song is dynamite, and very well recorded.
0	This book was just terrible: I think my title says it all, but I'll add a few reasons why. Bad writing, unappealing characters with no characterization at all (actually, that's a bit of a feat - how did Woods manage that?)trite dialogue, idiotic plot. Need I say more? I guess I'm especially bitter because I was trapped on a five hour flight, had already seen the movie being shown and all I had to read was this book. I wanted to parachute out of the plane. I see that used copies of this book are available for one cent. Save your penny.
0	Buy the Update: I bought this book for $250 and I also bought "How to Create and Manage a Mutual Fund or Exchange-Traded Fund" 9780470120552 for ~$70. This book was paper back and the "How to create..." book was hardback and copy written 3 years later (2008 compared to 2005 of this book.) The words are mostly the same on the mutual fund side, but they have added exchange traded funds into the book. All the graphs are updated and it is written by the same author.
0	Did I just get a lemon?: I find the reviews that extol this as a long-serving workhorse quite interesting -- and frustrating. I had this chopper and used it only about a half dozen times, though had it over a year. It just stopped working. B&D customer service didn't even express regret at my experience and refused to do anything about it. Since I had a B&D toaster oven (almost $100 on sale) that also gave out after just over a year, I won't be buying any more of their products.
0	Junk: Creates mush, and not uniform either, big chunks and mush. I wanted it to chop up peppers and like foodstuffs.
0	Frustrating and ineffective.: I find this chopper to be frustrating and ineffective. Food is always getting under the blades, pushing them up so that the blade is no longer caught by the drive shaft. This happens chopping something as easily chopped as onions, so forget having any success at the harder items, like nuts!The button is also very difficult to press. My young children used to help out on the kitchen by using the mini-chopper, but everyone except my 9 year old are unable to do so.I'm shopping for a new model...and hoping for better luck!
1	chopper/mincer: This Black & Decker chopper/mincer although small provides an excellent service for us. Perhaps we are easily satisfied because of the size of our hosehold, there are only two of us but we have no complaints about the efficiency and effectivenessBlack & Decker HC3061-1/2-Cup One-Touch Electric Chopperof this purchase.
1	Infrequent Chopper: I don't cook much but when I do, I hate having to chop everything and this little guy is a big help in the kitchen.
0	The Black & Decker Chopper Plus.: The Black & Decker Chopper Plus did not work if you put more than1/2 the container full of your ingredient. I was not happy with the product. I have had one for years and it works alot better than this one, but I had lost the blade to it and had to purchase this one.
1	Great: I work at a fire dept, so as we are known for I am always cooking. This makes cutting vegetables so easy. Within seconds you can have them cut. I can't believe I didn't buy one of these sooner.
0	The worst chopper I have ever used, from the first use!: We had high expectations with this, based on other reviews.We make pesto for home use with our old one that was my grandmothers for we don't know how long. Grandmother's was a different brand too.Anyways. We opened it, put the stuff in to make a small batch of pesto and we had to trash that batch and the chopper started smoking, as if it were overloaded.It's bad if you need to chop anything more than water, and even then, I think it would be bad at it.
0	Don't watch this movie!: This movie is total Bull! anybody who claims to like it, is probably faking it. The people who appreciate this movie, are probably like those who go to an Art Exhibition and appreciate Picaso's paintings, even though they know that the paintings are total Bull! hahathe other movies of Coen Brothers rock! but this movie is total bull!I hope nobody goes thru the same pain I did while watching this movie.Bottom line: This movie has no story! really! so, if you wanna spend time watching a good movie, then this movie is NOT for you!
0	dissapointing: The book is pretty good, though nowhere near as good as the Godfather. While the book keeps a secret that brings everything together until the very end, the movie bizarrely gives the secret away in the first10 minutes. I realize you don't have as much time to work with in a movie/TV series, but this makes everything fairly predictable. Lots of lame acting as well, even by otherwise-good actors.
0	dull and pointless: This movie starts off like a mystery/thriller, but quickly becomes a slow-moving and ultimately unsatisfying attempt at a character study. Do not watch it expecting to see a cop movie, or anything other than nicholson playing drunk.
0	Bad Movie: Typical excellent acting by Nicholson, but the movie was SLOW, poorly organized and had nothing besides Nicholson. The ending was very poorly done.
0	Just bad: Jack Nicholson turns in a great performance in this slow plodding movie.Jack clearly made this movie as a favor to his friend Sean Penn.Penn should stick to acting.The cut aways the distracting music,very disapointed.
1	Classroom Teacher Loved It: The first time I heard this book was while I was a guest teacher in second grade classroom. A parent choose to read this book to the class and they were enthralled. They could not take their eyes off the book and they could not stop talking about it afterwards. The next week when I was filling in for the librarian I decided to read this book to the third graders. They loved it partly because it was a new book to add to their holiday favorites. I wanted to add it to my library before the holidays but the book was nowhere to be found, except online. I was devasted but I will be ready to share this book with all my students next year.
0	Don't buy: Stay away from baseball game this year. Without MVP baseball having the mlb license, the games just aren't worth the time and money. MLB the show, has terrible game play and overall isn't fun to play. I bought MLB the show one night and sold it the next. MVP basebal sucks with the college players so don't buy that either.
1	Great Game: It is a great game. The rosters are updated really good. Except it doesn't have my favorite baseball player Barry Bonds. There is a lot of new gane modes like Rivalry Mode. I like Franchise mode a lot it's fun.I thought MLB 2K6 would be better but it's not I rated it 5 stars to. I think you should get MLB06 THE SHOW if you like really realistic games but get MLB 2K6 if you like kind of realistic games but is real easy.
1	What are you waitn' for?: Hey everbody this Cd is awesome...the girls rock, and don't give this CD any second thoughts! Make sure to listen to Say my Name, Bugaboo, and Bills, Bills, Bills!
1	great album: I really like this album. "So Good" is a really good upbeat song, "Bills, Bills, Bills" is a cool song about a bad relationship about a guy who takes things from them to be cool, "Confessions" isn't exactally the best song that could be on the album and Missy Elliot is kinda the backup singer in the song and it's redundant. "BUGABOO" is the BEST SONG ON THE WHOLE ALBUM! It has a great beat and is one you will repeat on the album. "Temptation" talks about how there's a guy they wan't but they already have boys. The last songs were what made me think twice about giving them 5 stars. The songs have annoying beats upset for the Outro. If you are a DC fan buy this album. I own both albums and the Destiny's Child today hasn't had another album in awhile.i saw them on tour a while ago and they were so awesome.
0	an OK album, not great: This was not as good as I had hoped and half of it is too slow to listen to while I am working out but the rest is good.
1	COOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL!: I thought this CD was sooooo cool. At first, i didn;t think I'd like it becuase I'm a pretty big BSB/NSync/98 degrees/5ive fan, but I thought I'd give it a try. Woah! I was blown away! The tracks are cool, the lyrics are cool, Destiny's Child is cool! You've gotta get it!
1	One of the best Courtroom Dramas: Amazing screenplay put on screen. A three hour journey back into the JFK controversy which shook up America and the world. Costner in rare form gives an unbelievable performance. A must see.
1	Most Accurate Movie Ever: Everybody should watch this movie it is an enlightening accurate depiction of the facts surrounding Kennedy's Assassination with a companion published book of sources it is certainly the most historically accurate film hollywood has come out with to date.
1	Blew my mind.: I relived the same moments JFK had.And Oliver Stone saying that "JFK was never meant to leave Dallas alive."Not just chilling, but so bone-chilling that it took me a long time to sleep.For sheer effect, it is on same par as ConspiracyConspiracymovie.The way each fact is researched thoroughly, the rattling inside the team of DA, and Jim's reaction to Robert Kennedy's assasination, my God.
0	Poor history, bad acting, terrible movie: This is truly a bad movie....The historical "premise" is incorrect. JFK expanded the war in Vietnam, and there is no reason to believe that he would have changed his mind if he had not been assasinated. The conspiracy plot is laughable. I did not think it was possible for me to feel sympathy for Lyndon Johnson, a failure as President, but the movie almost invoked those feelings by portraying him as a conspirator against JFK. Kevin Costner is awful as Garrison. His accent is amateurish, for example. Tommy Lee Jones is the only actor who puts in a credible performance.
1	So, you don't buy Stone's conspiracy theory?: Whether or not the film answers the questions surrounding the death of President Kennedy, it does boast bravura performances from Tommy Lee Jones, Donald Sutherland, Kevin Bacon, and, in a small yet memorable cameo, Larry Hagman. John Williams also contributes a very subtle yet powerful score, simultaneously ominous and poignant.
0	Some good advice, but not worth buying: I started reading this book, and while it seems to have some good points, the writing is pretty bad (strange for a book on writing to be poorly written). She keeps repeating herself over and over, about how successful she is. While trying to inspire, she is also depressing, that it may take years or decades to get yourself established. I don't think so...sounds like she's just trying to make money from this book, yet wants to discourage any new competition! Take my advice and buy the "Well Fed Writer" by Peter Bowerman. His advice is better, his writing is funny and very readable, and he doesn't speak to the reader like they're a moron. Which Flynn does, by the way.
0	dull!: its a dull film- theres not nearly enough JRM in it as id liked and some unknown reason we keep getting these pictures of rivers and babies and this Adam and Eve duo! does anyone understand what its about except the director?
1	Gotta see it to believe it.: 2001: A Space Odyssey meets Blue Velvet. It's as carefully paced and music-laden as the former, as far from redemption as the latter. Don't read any blurbs or summaries, just watch it.
0	B.S., B.S., B.S.!!!!!!!!!: The idea of this movie has got to be the biggest crock of *!%#. Science tells us that the first woman and man were AFRICAN, so why do we have a White woman playing "Eve"??? One can clearly see the explicit attempt to mock and separate the holy union between an African man and woman. First, the Egyptians were white and now Eve????? Give me a break. I'm just glad I have the knowledge to see through this trash.
0	DON'T BUY THIS VERSION: Don't make the mistake i did by buying this copy of this classic ITALIAN movie.It's a complete disaster with faded colors and grainy images.I can't beleive they put this one on the market.You'll get to see the three sketches all right, but the transfer is simply amateurish and insulting.No subtitles,not even the original ITALIAN track,no gallery of photos etc.This is the worst dvd i ever bought.Luckily for others,a new version was released in 2005 which has the proper treatment.I just hope that VISCONTI's last movie THE INNOCENT won't fall in this category when they released it someday.Let us pray for the preservation of LAURA ANTONELLI's beauty.
0	Dumb As Hell , But Watchable: Soldier is one of those films that was just made to be poked fun at. Everything about this film is familiar. The plot is basically Escape From New York meets The Road Warrior. Russell and Busey deserve better than this. The action is a joke, and the acting is hilarious. Just watch this to laugh.
0	Lied about the size: We love this movie and it was listed as1:77 in size. When we recieved it the size was 2:35. This is call bait and switch. Shoppers don,t buy this movie unless you want to watch the movie with the heads cut off .
0	Whiz Bang Ending But it misses the mark.: Well after watching a wonderfully violent, strangely poetic ending I found myself liking this film alot more than I did the first hour into it. They try to make us like the main character who has no personality and they try to make us care for the community he falls into, but the film is so full of cliches and poor characterization that the first hour meanders and the ending though fun and exciting , a bit more hollow than I'd like.
0	Boring!!!!!!!!!!!: Kurt was pulling a arnold job. I think he had about two lines of dialoge through out the intire movie. The story is pretty good.I'm sorry I purchased it. Should have rented it first.
0	Stay Away!: My experience with this device was horrible. It took weeks to get it to work right, I spent hours on the phone with tech support who couldn't figure out why. Finally the "master tech" spoke to "the designers" and they sent me some software update which made it work. However this was after 2 replacements that all failed to work (Windows XP)Even once it workd it turned out that the software is incompatible with Vista.And when I had to wipe my XP computer and wanted to reinstall it, I found that all software download link were removed from smarthome's web site, leaving me with a useless wall wart.BUYER BEWARE: STAY AWAY!
1	The Shop Around the Corner: They don't make romantic comedies like they used to, and no one made them quite like director Ernst Lubitsch, whose famed "touch" lights this wry, poignant, perennially charming film. Veteran players Stewart and Sullavan are a perfect match as comically antagonistic lonelyhearts, conveying their characters' vulnerabilities with a delicacy too often missing from the tepid Hanks-Ryan remake, "You've Got Mail". Rich subplots involving the wonderful Frank Morgan and Joseph Schildkraut, who plays a scheming, boastful employee, let Lubitsch impart further nuance to this modest but wholly pleasing tale. A delight from start to finish, this is one "Shop" you'll want to dally in.
1	What You've Got Mail Should Have Been: With an ensemble cast that could only exist when the studio system was in full flower, this classic film unites Stewart with friend Henry Fonda's wife in a charming and quirky romance tour de force. It's easy to see why they team that transmuted Affair to Remember into Sleepless in Seattle thought they could recapture the magic of big box office. But it was impossible for Hanks and Ryan to live up to the charm and allure of Sullivan or Stewart. This film must be in the library of anyone who admires excellence and a joyful celebration of love.
1	Corner Shop review: wonderful movie! Classic Jimmie Stewart. Great for the entire family to watch. If you enjoyed "You've Got Mail" with Ryan and Hanks, you should enjoy this movie - it's a similar storyline, though with snail mail, not email.
1	Excelente livro!: Uma rápida olhada no índice do livro atestam que estou diante de um conteúdo bastante promissor. O papel e a impresso deixam a desejar. A encadernao é frágil para o tamnho do livro.
1	I echo the 5-star rating of this book: I was introduced to this book by staff at my local children's book store. I was intrigued with the concept of the book being written from the perspective of a boy's journal, as I glanced through it before buying it. That night I read it, and it will be one of the jewels in my bookcase. It is a tremendous way of introducing young people to poetry and is just a charming story!!! LOVE THIS BOOK!!!
1	Love that Book!: It's a charming, delightful, true book about10 yo boys and poetry. My10yo boy agrees with most of it (he's not quite as in love with poetry by the end, but he's getting there) I would recommend this to anyone with a child struggling to appreciate poetry but especially to boys. It's so loving and light filled. It's a delightful book and a real treasure. We're keeping it!
0	Simply disappointing! I don't recommend this album to anyone!: It seems that all the energy, the "music stamina" Al Jarreau had, is definitely gone. I waited until I could read all the comments on this album, then bought it. Wasted money! If you're expecting to find more of the magnificent Jazz & Pop exercises Al Jarreau did in "Breakin' Away", "Jarreau" or "L Is For Lover", just forget it...!!! This album is for dark-Jazz & Blues fans only. Anyway, Jarreau's voice sounds simply murky and boring.
1	Authour recreates his own life story.: Neil Albert's "monthly series" continues in its 6th entery. This time Dave Garret is set out to solve a totaly different case. He is looking for his biological parents.The author states that this is based on his search for his birth parents and that brings a more human emotion to the story itself.Alberts intertwining chapters of different naratives actually gives two interesting prespectives to the same story.As the story opens we find Dave in his office with nothing to do, basicly jobless buy with a job. Until he is presued to find his father, his biological father. He sets out to California where his mother stayed during her pregnancy with her family. He hopes he will be able find the truth there but it leads to nowhere. With a twist of fate and a confession Dave is sent on the right track and you are left with a great mystery.
1	A Classic from an Early Hippie Band: The themes of the songs may seem dated to younger listeners, but this album still holds up as the music is fun, interesting and excellent. This was one of the first Hippie bands, and therefore may sound super-outdated to young listeners today, but give it a chance; you won't be sorry. The vocals from these guys are always interesting and enjoyable, even downright beautiful. They are quirky and wonderful, as is this CD.
1	Excellent CD!: I only recently learned about this band. This greatest hits CD contains lots of the songs played on satellite radio while I'm driving to work. Great band ! I love the singer. I only wish they were not broken up. An excellent bargain for a fan, new or old!
1	Very good: The cd was purchased as a Christmas gift and I assume everything was fine with it. Your service was excellent and was received in a timely manner. Thank you
1	Full Poster Sized: Nice poster for a violin teachers room. It would make a nice chart for beginners. Really everything on the chart is in your beginning books, but stuck up on the wall, it can help teach the students. This is a full sized poster, not a little chart.
0	even schwarzenegger must hope this one goes away: with voice by someone other than arnold this movie falls into the realm of the if he weren't famous this one would never see the light of day. really the worst. skip it!
1	Better!: I liked this book a lot better then the previous one! I really liked how Christine really pursued God in what she should do concerning her relationship with Eric! Overall great read!
0	NOT worth10$: I bought this set a while ago because it looked unique and fun. Do not make the same mistake I made of buying it, it is not worth even10$! The exercises are extremely fast paced. What I mean by this is that he will show you a move for a split second then expect you to have it mastered so while they're dancing away a million miles a minute, you're stuck there still trying to figure out how to do the moves. My other problem is when I would do the resistance disc exercises, I honestly did not feel any shape or form of a burn meaning the exercise wasn't doing ANYTHING (and to top it off, I was using the most resistant band the set came with). I wasted money on this ridiculous program, shame on BeachBody for releasing this!
1	good product: really like this product. I would recommend this product if you are looking for this type of item for your computer needs.

FOLOWED BY PIKACHU PARTY .
0	Good ideas, bad execution: I bought this book because it had the largest and most creative selection of recipes, but that's just not good enough.After two failures today I referred back to some "old standards" and discovered that the proportion of flour to liquid is different by almost 3 ounces in some cases. The result was a sticky mess that could barely be corrected by adding more and more flour. In one case, adding flour never did compensate for the combinations of other ingredients (chocolate and orange segments).When I read the book more closely, I discovered that the author recommends standing by during mixing to make this adjustment on all the recipes. So much for having fresh bread ready when you wake up in the morning.The author's credentials seem good, but she doesn't understand the breadmaker's approach.I suppose I'll use the ideas in this book and adjust the liquid as needed, but it certainly won't replace the recipes that I've used for the past ten years. Too bad.
1	Great Bread Machine cookbook!: I bought this book for my son along with a bread machine. I almost kept this cookbook for myself and plan to buy one for me, too. Great variety of breads and doughs to choose from.
1	a treasure for bread lovers: I love this book, not only does it have great solid bread machine recipes, it also has some more challengins and unique breads you can play around with. I feel it elevates bread machine baking to a more artistic level in some ways. Highly recommed this book.
1	ProKeys 88SX - the real deal: This keyboard is a great little keyboard, 7 solid sounds, minimum frills, great price and easy to transport. I use it mainly for recording. It is not really what I would call a road-worthy board, but in a static set-up, it's perfect for me.
0	bored to death: at school last week we watched this movie, history class. It was exteamly borning. I learned noting and only was disgusted RENT THIS FIRST, PO
1	Definitive historical masterpiece: If you liked 'Last of the Mohicans', 'The Mission', or 'The New World', then read on. This film is relatively unknown in the UK, and sadly does not seem to be available in Region 2. If you can play films from other regions, I urge you to buy this veritable masterpiece. The haunting scenery, understated acting, and overwhelming authentic period feel, add up to a memorable cinema experience that will stay with you. The portrayal of the savage culture of the native American Indians can be hard to watch at times but the excellent cast draw you in to the story in a way seldom seen these days. Not a blockbuster or action film, this will reward the fan of historical drama, and those who can appreciate first class cinematography and photography. Don't be put off by the 'religious' theme, it is only part of a wider view on colonisation and faith.Serious cinema for the true film buff.
0	bleh x 5!: If someone wanted to write a book about Tolkien & Middle Earth, they should have researched a little better. Not *this* garbage! Tolkien was a CATHOLIC -- & a hard-liner at that. Catholic. Not Buddhist, not Pagan & certainly NOT Gnostic (sheesh! Some of this stuff in this book was hard to read because it was so WRONG)! Yes, he got some of his ideas from mythology (the myth part of the book is ok, I guess. But, there are so many *other* *better* books about myth out there than *this*... I know I've read better). But, the books are basically Catholic. Just read the Sil & you'll see what I mean! There's hardly *anything* in here about Tolkien's Catholic upbringing as it pertains to the books. If I want the *real* story on Tolkien & what he believed & wrote, I'll stick w/Tolkien's Letters & Joseph Pearce.I shouldn't have bought this book, but... well, I'm a sucker for anything Tolkien.....
1	Arthur enters the story line!: Jack Whyte does a superb job in this continuation of his version of the Arthur legend. This is the way Arthur really could have come to power. I've read this series (9 books in all) at least 5 times front to back and plan to read them again often at least once per year probably. I can't say enough good things about this author and this series!In this book Arthur enters the story (actually, he did that at the end of the previous book, The Saxon Shore in the closing pages). This series is just brilliant. The best and most credible retelling of the Arthur legend.
0	Romance in Disguise: When women write stories about mute girls who are saved by big, strong men who teach them to be sexually aware, that is considered Romance fiction and is looked down upon. But here we have the same formula: a mysterious young girl, beautiful and abused, unable to speak. A hero of mythical proportions comes to her rescue. Cassandra never felt real to me, because the author never lets her speak -- just another female character to manipulate and show the hero off to advantage.Historical fiction and historical detail are good things, when there are real characters to hold them up, and a real story to listen to. This book seesaws between long and tedious discussions of theology and Danielle Steele.
0	American TV in1944? Heh-heh-heh!: This WIN PRODUCTIONS DVD is curious and highly suspect.There was no AMOS 'N' ANDY TV show in1944, nor did Freeman Gosden and Charles Correll (pictured here all corked up) appear in the early 50s television sitcom. (Amos Jones was played by Alvin Childress and Andy 'Hogg' Brown was Spencer Williams.)The three episodes divided into parts on this item's Editorial Review ("Invisible Glass," "The Gun" and "Kingfish Gets Drafted") are single-episode programs that run 25 minutes each. As for "the best episodes of Amos & Andy," that's a matter of opinion. They're typical A&A; shows, to be sure.I doesn't know 'bout dis one, Andy!
0	I am missing something, right?: So this is a "London Times Funny Music Cartoons" mousepad that features Barry Gibb of laying on a psychiatrist's sofa quoting the beginning lyrics to...."I Started A Joke"???. But Barry doesn't sing a single note on the song which everyone knows is pretty much a Robin Gibb solo, so the selection of this lyric for this cartoon makes no sense. Clearly the artist was not very knowledgeable about the subject they were rendering a cartoon about. And oh yeah- how is this cartoon funny? I know the lyrics make no sense (many early Bee Gees lyrics don't), but how is this cartoon funny? The London Times actually published this at one time (I guess it was a slow news day. And now some 20 years later, I would want this cartoon as a mousepad because why?? Oh- and the actual lyric in the word balloon is wrong too.
0	Good Film Bad Version: This is sad, because as much as i love this film, i must give it one star. This is probably because of the DVD. This film is cut and censored. My point is the 2 most famous parts (The fetus eating and the eating of the organs) have been completly cut out. I think this was due to the rush of companies to get there movies on DVD. I should have known better when i didnt see the name Anthropopaguhs anywere on the box. Tisa Farrow is so hot and we should really get to see alot more of her in this movie (its done by Joe D'Amato the soft-core gore guy who did Ilsa and Emanuell films and we dont see any nudity at all in this film). I have the uncut version, the sequal Absurd and the lesser more cheap tribute and/or remake Anthropopagus 2000. Wait a while, im sure this will come out uncut some day...
1	its okay: Just remember when you buy this book that it's from Microsoft Press, so expect it to lean towards supporting the Microsoft Internet Explorer, with plenty of plugs accordingly - so some of the techiques in this book will not work on the Netscape browser - but these are clearly marked as such, so there shouldn't be any confusion. It comes with a CD ROM which helps you see what you are reading about and comes with a version of the MSIE that you can download. Its nice and easy to read and 'EVEN I' can understand it all
0	Aggressive Defense of Marriage: The Tender Trap is one of the most aggressive defenses of marriage ever seen in the movies. Carefree Frank Sinatra is bullied by depressed married friend David Wayne into leaving his happy bachelor life for the supposed solidity of married life. Frank is eventually roped by control-freak Debbie ("I don't care who I marry as long as I'm married by 22") Reynolds into a presumably happily ever after married future. A depressing movie that is barely redeemed by sympathetic performances by Sinatra and Celeste Holm. David Wayne's portrayal of a self-absorbed, cruel detached husband is o.k. in a thankless role. Debbie Reynold's character is truly frightening.
1	Simply Fantastic...: Radical Cure is the first book I've read by Olivia Gates...but, cetainly not my last. I'll be grabbing up her backlist asap!The previous reviews already provide the background for this book... I'll just add that this is an edgy, fast-paced, action-packed novel. I wouldn't limit it to a "medical thriller".Calista St. James is a smart, strong, capable woman and sparks fly when she is with Damian De Luna, a smart, sexy, capable man. The author not only writes intelligent 3-D characters, but she knows how to turn up the heat between these two.I think this book can be read as a stand-alone book, but I have already placed my order for Strong Medicine.
1	Another Great Book-To-Movie: One of my all-time favorites. Great locations, timeless story, excellent production values, and of course, a marvelous cast. No actor is mis-cast. The film never becomes maudlin or overly sentimental, though in another director's hand that might have happened. It simply tells the story the way Conrad told it.My DVD library won't be complete until this is added to it. When will it be released on DVD?
1	Superb Sequel!: If you liked the first volume of Cinema Serenade, you will love this one. It features beautiful, lush arrangements and Perlman's always gorgeous playing. This record is also exquisitely engineered and the balance between the Pops and Perlman is perfect. You want this recording.
0	Star Trek: Gateways Book One - One Small Step: This is getting totally pitiful. The mini-series junk trying to span stories through all the different genres of StarTrek in my opinion belongs in the trash. Pocket Books is making a big mistake. I for one only care for the original cast books. I buy one to read (which I've read them all) and I get no ending unless I go read Next Generation and then the next genre and the next and the one after that.YUCK!!
1	Life is just an edless waltz: Endless waltz is an awsome movie. the special edition DVD includes the OVA episiodes of the movie, it also includes a mobel suit encyclopedia and is veiwable in mutiple languages. It has the same voices as in the show(english version anyways). If you saw this on the cartoon network or YTV(people in canada), then you might have thought that it was very heavly edited, the truth is that it wasn't. sure commercials but thats about it. BUT, if you only saw it once, than you probobly didn't catch it all at once. Its a great DVD packed with loads of stuff that will make this a great movie from begining to end.
0	GRAND: I watched the movie on Cartoon Network about two years ago. It's an excellent movie, I tell you. It's facinating!!! ^_^I loved the characters and their personalities. I seriously loved the art designs animation. It brings out the true life of the movie. In my opinion, this DVD is great! You should get this DVD and soon. It ROCKS! ^_^!
1	You Get What You Pay For: This is not a bad product, at all. As with most camping equipment, a lower price means lower quality. If you purchase this item knowing this, then you won't be disappointed. The grill is not all that tall, so you have to let the fire burn down to coals before putting this over it. We used it mostly to hold up a small propane stove to allow for better air circulation underneath, and it worked spectacularly for that!
1	Eternal Truth: These reflective,honest and wholly recitable poems are an endless delight.Who can argue with their truths?Maybe the (...) moral prig who will be a millennia dead and forgotten while the eternal Omar shines a light of realness and honesty in a world full of flowers and forests loving nitwit poets and poeple (...) who insist that life only be seen through the view of his religion.Go read the nonsensical,idiotic,mystical blather of Rumi if you want your poets "spiritual".If you have taste, read Khayyam. Grade:A+
0	Torture: When Marvin Mange is involved in a fatal car accident, he is brought back to life as half man half animal. With his newly formed animal features, we are expected to laugh at the gags that happen as a result. But all these gags do is attempt to make the viewer less intelligent. This film heavily relies on toilet humour and it's target audience seems to be aimed at younger kids. Are adults really expected to laugh at this low class humour? If we do, we should be ashamed of ourselves!Utter tripe.
1	The Animal (Uncut Special Edition): rob's funny and it can sometimes not be funny but over all it's a great laugh.
1	Schneider does it again!: If you've seen Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo and liked Rob Schneider's performance (no pun intended) as much as I did - then you'll love The Animal! Same kind of goofy humor. Will definitely be buying this on DVD when it's released.
1	Listen to it again: When I first heard this album, I was thinking...um, no. But I listened to it a few times more (being a fan) and discovered its greatness. Now, not every track is great, but those that are make up for the others. I found it has a really great retro-80's sound that I hear others trying to produce, but didn't hit the mark like this one did.
1	In My Opnion: J.R.R. Tolken is an amazing writer, with such enchanting lands and exciting adventures it is hard not to get wrapped up in his books and never put them down.
0	boring!!!!: most boring book ever better of reading song of ice and fire this book is all bout walkin can't believe its so good chuck away its sux
0	I only put1 star so people would read this :-): Tolkien wrote an undescrible book and it cannot be done in any way and i think , that how his son tried to finish the whole series, is bad and he shouldn't have touched it because it's J.R.R.'s not Christopher's and he should have not killed the Dark Lord [Sauron] because evil must stay in the land of Middle-Earth because thats what gave the book meaning
1	The Two Towers, The best book ever!: The two towers is an awesome book. The fellowship has now broken into three groups, and the book follows the whereabouts and events of Merry and Pippin, Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli, and Frodo and Sam. Merry and Pippin have been captured by the relentless Uruk-Hai and escape into Fangorn Forest. Frodo and Sam are hopelessly trying to fufill their quest to destroy the ring with the deceitful Gollum as their guide. Meanwhile, Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli are tracking the captured hobbits in Fangorn Forest when Gandalf returns to them. They all make for Edoras and heal the bewitched king Theoden. After retreating to the fortress of Helm's Deep, Aragorn leads the battle to make a final stand...This is a fantastic book that i recommend to readers ages14 and up. There is a lot going on a one time that might be hard for younger kids to understand. I had to read the series over again to make sure i understood.
1	The Heart of ot All: We return to Middle- Earth in <u>Return of the King<u/>, the last book in <u>The Lord of The Rings<u/> trilogy. With the Fellowship already broken and parted, Frodo and Sam struggle deep in the heart of Mordor to the fires of Mount Doom. Sam begins to lose heart as Frodo falls deeper and deeper into the power of the One Ring. Aragorn comes to fully understand that as Isildur's air, he must take up the throne in Gondor. All throughout this journey, Sauron, the enemy of the people of Middle- Earth, feels his need for the One Ring growing. He will do anything to get it back, even kill the Ring- bearer.J.R.R Tolkien has created a masterpiece! You can feel the emotion and action of every event in this thriller. If you've read <u>The Fellowship of the Ring<u/> and <u>The Two Towers<u/>, I strongly advise you tie up the trilogy with this incredible journey. This book is very inspiring.
1	Wonderful Storytelling. Worthy Tolkien Novel.: In the Second Volume of the Lord of the Rings Trilogy, the story of Gimli, Legolas, Sam, and Frodo's sojourn to destroy the One Ring of Power continues. Wonderful character contrast between the flighty and angelic Elven creature Legolas, and his stout hearted dwarven companion Gimli. Engrossing universe of magic and lore that is worthy of Tolkien's talents.
1	Ella and Louis: Now this one is a no-brainer:EVERYBODY knows by now how great idea was teaming Ella (at her peak) and Louis (close enough to his peak) on this album,with a killer back-up group lead by Oscar Peterson at his rhythmiest (yes, I know it's not a real word). I'm writing about the original CD from the early 2000s I bought, not about SACD (where the review will apparently, also end up), so I can't talk about the technological finesse of this edition... I'm just claiming this is a beautiful jazz album, happily matched only byElla and Louis Again, another masterpiece. Groveling expressiveness of Louis' voice is matched beautifully with the melodic brilliance of Ella's jubilant voice and the rest is history.
1	not so bad: although i would have to say not my fav movie of all time, it's not all that bad..many folks might enjoy it and for [the price]what a steal!!! i think you see adam sandler in a different light (kinda like jim carey in the majestic....not so moranic...ps i do love little nicky). the kinda look at the camera, documentry style is cool and if you love nostalgia...not enough said 'bout the milton berle appearence....a must see
0	crummy crummy crummy: this is the worst movie i have ever seen! i turned it off it was so bad! i got it at wal-mart in like their $3 bin or something... they should have paid ME to get it!
0	Ouch This Movie Hurts: I had to write this review to counterbalance all the faked 5 star reviews. I picked this up for a buck thinking it would be worth seeing Adam Sandler's first feature film. The only part that made it worthwhile was seeing the happy Madison guys so young. Sandler does a decent job and you can see how his career got launched. Outside of that this movie is a train wreck. The plot is a waste of time. The acting is over the top and hammy. On of the most egregious parts is the sound. The only way people might like this is in its so bad its a cult classic thing. Beware the casual movie goer won't be swayed by girls in bikinis.
0	I wish no stars were an option: I believe catching every disease on earth at once would be more pleasant than watching this movie. It's not even worth a penny, which is probably how much they spent making this film. Save yourself time, money, sanity and I.Q. points RUN AWAY!
0	I had no other choice but to read this book.: This is the only book that I had to read on my flight to Florida. I was trapped! I did not like or sympathize with any of the characters. Wait, yes I did, the dog. He was the only one who was real. Self centered garbage.
1	good movie.: My daughter was doing a report on Christa McAuliffe. We rented this after she had done her report. She enjoyed actually seeing how the space program worked.
1	END OF ONE SERIES AND ACTUAL START OF ANOTHER: Enjoyed this one as much as the others in the series. This ends the Belgariad series and sets up for the Malloreon. All in all these are good reads. Most of the folks I know have read this series and The Malloreon several times...they are sort of habit forming. If read for what they were written for, light books which should be enjoyed and ones to have fun with, then you will like them. If on the other hand if you just graduated from Jr. High and are much, much too mature for them, then you should probably wait until you reach your dotage so that you can appreciate them again. Yes, they are flawed and yes there are endless contradictions (some 233 by my last count), but that is part of the charm of this work. Hey, go out to a oak tree in the woods or in your park, kick back, read and enjoy. Recommend highly.
0	Don't waste your time or money: I got this book as a gift and still think it was a waste of money. Every dream I have looked up so far was negative, most dealing w/ some future pending event, ie if you dream 'X' you are soon to lose your job or some other misfortune. How a dream relates to some future event in the physical world I'll never know. I was hoping it would deal more w/ what's going on in my subconscious, but that doesn't seem to be what this book is about.
0	Not a good Kindle edition: Unfortunately, this Kindle version is missing almost all of the illustrations, which are an integral part of the book. And the poetry is not formatted correctly and is in red on my iPad Kindle.Through the Looking Glass [Kindle Edition] by BLTC is the one you want.
1	Alice's BIG Adventures in Wonderland: I should have looked at the size of this book in making the selection. Although this book is beautiful, lovely dust jacket, interesting illustrations, it is almost too big to casually read and is more of a coffee table book. It was bought as a companion to a collectable given as a Christmas present. The entire gift was precious though and the book really made it special.
0	Only Two Stars for the Penguin Edition: It's a fantastic book, of course, and it certainly doesn't need me to praise it as millions have done before. It's probably one of the most unique things ever written: the only book that could be considered both completely a children's story and completely a book for adults. The only problem with the Penguin edition is that it's grossly over-annotated. For scholars this may be very helpful, but sadly enough a lot of the notes are either irrelevant to non-professors or provide critical instead of historical or biographical commentary which, in my opinion, ruins the greatest delight of the book: AAIW/TLG are highly interpretable and symbolic stories, but unfortunately the commentator is always interrupting like a nagging pedant before the reader has a chance to reflect. Once again, both stories well deserve their status as true English classics but another edition might be a better choice.
0	In the Rabbit Hole: This is not a pretty edition. For a serviceable edition just to read the wonderful words of these stories and to have them together, it's ok. The printing is dense and the quality of the paper is poor. The price is great. Not for a gift. Teresa
0	get a magnifying glass: I was super sad when this book arrived :( The print was sooooo small that no one wanted to read it. When purchasing the book on Amazon there was no "preview" of the pages or inside of the book. I guess that I learned my lesson. I ended up purchasing a different Alice's Adventures In Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass book so that we could read a book that had larger print. I was not happy with this book, and would not recommend it to anyone if you enjoy "normal" size print. This was really tiny!!!!!The book arrived in good shape and the shipping was satisfactory.
1	Not Just a Beloved Children's Book!: This book is a delight to both young and old, and as many times as I've read it or had it read to me, I still love the story. For one thing the characters are unforgettable. Who can forget the Queen of Hearts, Tweedledum and Tweedledee and the Mad Hatter? There are so many adaptations of this book and so many varied ways to enjoy it, that there is perhaps a danger that it may be overused. I think though that it is best enjoyed read in a book since that is where the imagination can take over and make the book something magical. Take the time to reread this great classic. It's well worth it.
0	Where is the Looking Glass?: I purchased this book because I was specifically lo0king for the sequel, Through the Looking-Glass. I already have "Alice", and for free. This edition claims Looking Glass in its title, but only includes Alice. Do not be fooled. Get Alice for free and skip this misleading version.
1	alice in wonderland: this classic story is totally worth the read. if you love fantasy this is the book to read!
0	Too little technique too much speculation and opinion: With phrases like "Because extreme physical regimens like bodybuilding are so unhealthy, a completely new medical specialty - sports medicine - has been developed in recent years," Griner dishes many opinions in the form of medical fact. His cause and effects are often speculative or down right incorrect. Sure, his technique works, but he writes about too many topics in which he has not been schooled.
1	Very Excellent: This game is a must if you like first person 3d shooter. Quake provides a wide variety of game play. The multiplayer aspect of the game makes it worth playing over and over. There are many mods (modifacations) that you can add on for extra and different game play. Team Fortress, which is by far the most popular mod, is the most fantastic multiplayer game out there that I've played. Also for those of you who are nerds, Quake II multiplayer actually shrinks the players and makes you think that the levels are actually bigger. :)
0	not the first choice: Getz other Bossa Nova album's are classics. Start with the delightful "Getz/Gilberto", the second best selling Jazz CD of all time, then "Jazz Samba", "Jazz Samba Encore". But by the time Norm Grantz at Verve pushed him into this, he was pretty tired of Samba."Chenga de Saudade" is definitely the best and "Niote Triste" is pleasant but this type of big band highly-scripted format wasn't his forte. It's Stan, so he's (almost) never bad, he puts on a brave face and does the best under the circumstances.Inoffensive, but quite Pop and shallow.Make sure you have the other albums above before you get this one.Sorry they can't all be great. Tryin' to save you money.
1	Great read!: This was my first Stuart Woods book. It has a great pace, keeps you interested and gets you involved with characters. I definitely recommend it.
1	Stan and Ollie in the Trenches: Fully restored to its original 68-minute length, Laurel and Hardy's second starring feature holds up surprisingly well. "Pack Up Your Troubles" (1932) remains among the team's most enjoyable efforts, with several classic routines and an excellent supporting cast. Stan and Ollie are a pleasure to watch in this offbeat World War I comedy-drama. Look for a cameo by director George Marshall as the vengeful cook.
0	One of the worst movies I have ever seen: Definitely in the bottom five. The screen play strains to include the well-known historical points of its subject into the film in the most ham-fisted and contrived ways in an attempt to build a feature film length linear story. It fails heroically. The skeleton story is padded out with fabricated hokum, Hollywood star turns by Warren Beatty in possibly his most annoying performance ever, and gratuitous violence galore. If ever there was a must-miss it's this pile of garbage.
0	A let down: The Simple Minds (a brass band in african chimes) and Mansun (wide open space) tracks are super, as are, of course, the two Chicane tracks (which can be found on Far From The Maddening Crowds). Otherwise, I'm really hard pressed to recommend any other tracks. Not recommended.
0	Slow and amateurish: Poorly done and as stated quite amateurish. It simply did not get moving and finally turned it off. If it got any better I'd be surprised.
0	boring: Movie was very boring, not what i expected. The movie does not have much to offer. Overall I would not recommend this movie.
1	A "Must Have" for college dorm rooms: We have 4 kids and got our first Hot Shot when they all lived at home. We love it and use it almost everyday. It became the "must have" for college item as each of them went off to college over the last 7 years. We just bought the last one for our youngest who is going to college this fall. We've also bought them for graduation gifts for friends and general family gifts - they are greatly appreciated and used. Wish Amazon would buy these in bulk and make them available for free shipping ; )
0	This guide sucks: After ascertaining that this was the best market guide for me to purchase in order to get my novel published I gladly ordered it. Well, they don't include a great deal of reputable literary agents (who are constantly in the trades). Example: Trident Media, ICM, William Morris-even Gloria Loomis (Walter Mosley's agent---and he wrote an intro article "Connecting with the rest of the world through words" on page 6 (!!!). In addition they don't even list major Science-Fiction awards, the Hugo and Nebula-what else are they missing. I feel robbed. Then to make matters worse, I went to their website to complain (filled out their form) and got a bounce back that said, "This is an automatically generated Delivery Status Notification. Delivery to the following recipients failed. anneb@fwpubs.com"LAME!!!
0	piece of garbage: I bought mine almost1 year ago, trying to improve my old (but good) Dell Axim X5, and after using the warranty 4 times, (because the one I bought was overheating when it was Off) first they replaced the battery, then the equipment (twice) and the IPaQs continue overheating, with no technical explanation from HP. Now they offered me an "Improvement" to my original choice (the IPaQ 210) but these guys are so smart that sent me only the new IPaQ (210) with no battery, cables, Installation CD, stylus, etc. (the 2795 and the 210 are quite differents in the accessories) this was almost1 month ago and they are still playing games with me. Conclusion: after1 year of purchasing the IPaQ I could use it properly around1 month. My worst experience as Client.... I will go back to DELL.
1	Had to send it back!: I really like the product, its way smaller that I thought, 2 reason i had to send it back,1. dead pixel, 2. had to reset 3 times in one hour. i dont know wat the heck is wrong with it. it doesnt support kingstore secure digital card, (4gb), otherwise the lcd is cristal clear, has wifi internet which is preety amazing, fast, i didnt get to see everything yet cuz i shiped it back the same day i got it, hope the one i am getting now comes with no diffects.
1	Good: Three CD set of piano music.Long,austere improvisations remindingrenaissance organ playing.The Second Part is especially fine.Recommended!
0	Quality could be better: It was dark and cloudy at times. Not the greatest buy. I am very disappointed. Can I return for a refund?
1	Best Music Video Ever!!!: This is a video that you will want to watch over & over & over - and love every time. Absolutely the best music video ever made.
0	wasted money: I am restricted to a wheelchair, and so must rely on grabbers,to assist me when reaching for things in higher areas or across wide spacess. I already had one of the ergonomically18' grabbers in this style and really liked the light wt. and dexterity it allowed me, over many of the other styles. So, I was very disappointd when after the THIRD time I used it, I heard a click and part of the internal workings actually came through the handle, Now, it just takes up space while I try to see if I can get my money back. Needless to say, I am aggeivated and dissapointd. DONT BUY THIS PRODUCT.
1	Desert Island Essential: I have made a gift of this album to a number of my friends. If I had to pick only10 pieces of music ever, this would be my first choice. Timeless, elegant, soulful, spiritual, dark, sad, silent!
0	IT HAS NOTHING TO DO ABOUT SPYING: This is not an espionage thriller as the cover and title of this book would have you beleive. The vast majority of the content in this book is about how two people working in the CIA fall in love with each other and how they are so excited being around one another. I for one, and i think most people would agree, think that someone who would buy this book would be interested in the CIA and the history of the cold war. This book has nearly nothing to do with either of those subjects! Their are some good parts to this book but they are overshadowed by a love story. This book would be better catogorized as a romance novel!
0	Poorly written love story, good spy story: This book needed an editor. I felt as if the authors were trying to increase their page count by putting in way too many descriptors about things that didn't need describing.The love story is ridiculous. It is forced into the narrative like a square peg in a round hole. I skipped all the things about "our eyes met, and I felt myself blush" etc. Come on Jonna, you are a master of disguise and you can't disguise the fact that you slept with your boss the night before?The spy story is interesting, although lacking some details understandably to protect on-going missions.A beach read.
0	Poorly Written with Virtually No Story Line to Follow: WOW....I never thought a publishing house would allow a book to be published without having an editor read it first. The authors desperately needed to employ a ghostwriter for assistance.The story line is almost impossible to follow, the personal references to their "love story" are dull and self-serving and they left out significant and I might add, much required details of operations, planning and ending results all that made this book a real time (and money) waster.The storyline, billed as a look behind secret spy techniques and operations, has in reality, little to do about spying, operations, the Cold War or the CIA. You can learn more from a bad James Bond movie. The other review recommending it be classified as a romance novel is correct. This book seems to have been written as a personal memoir not for mass consumption.
1	Hilariously slanted look at history: This movie is great! Highly entertaining, especially for those of us who even know what Watergate was. Though young at the time, this movie brought the times back in a hilarious fashion. I'm suprised at how many kids in school today have never even heard of Watergate. Maybe this funny look at a twisted history will cause them to look back. Oh yeah, great soundtrack. Peace man!
0	Whatever you do don't waste your money on this movie: Me and my friends rented this movie even though we'd never heard of it. All I have to say is it was the biggest waste of money I've ever spent. This movie was terrible. I'm a fan of Michelle Williams in Dawson's Creek but she destroyed any credibility that she had by starring in this movie. The movie was supposed to be a comedy, but there was nothing funny about it. We were so bored that we didn't even finish it. We had to turn it off it was too terrible to finish. Whatever you do don't put yourself through the torture of having to see this movie.
1	Keeps you laughing: Well you don't have to be a history buff to get the gags in this movie. Both lead actresses have that ditzy, aloof girl next door routine done pat and this along with the situations they accidently find themselves in makes for one heck of a re-watchable movie. I usually love DVD's that have enough content to last10 or more viewings and this definately one of them. There are plenty of jokes or play on the word ' Dick ' in this movie and that alone is good enough to last for multiple viewings. I'm not a history buff, but you don't have to be to get how ' Walnut Leaves ' could have re-written the history books...There's to much to this movie to explain, just buy its money well spent.
0	Love Ella; didn't love this CD: This was a very jazzy album and just seemed to try too hard. I know singers must get tired of singing the same type of songs, but I didn't enjoy this one at all and gave it away. Didn't even want to keep it for my Christmas collection.
1	Something's happening here....: A haunting, mysterious and magical movie. Marjorie Cameron adds an element of real life magic. Kenneth Anger also had done this when he used her in `The Inauguration of the Pleasure Dome (1954)'. Marjorie Easton also adds to the spell, and Dennis Hopper is wonderful. The carnival is the perfect background for a a plot about fantasy and reality. Filmed at the Santa Monica Pier, Venice and Ocean Park, California, where Anton LaVey played organ at strip joints in the late1940's. The name Mora is found in many parts of the world as the death aspect of the `Triple Goddess', or Night Mare, or female vampire.
0	Good as paper weight: Never been able to sync with computer, battery consistently deteriorated and now,12 months after I bought it and despite the minimal use (as it does not connect with PC its use is very limited), battery has now completely died and can only use it when connected to AC.HP assistance is useless - suggested to assist me purchase a new one - right, not in a million years.Not impressed by product or by HP. Had a Dell before which worked flawlessly for years. Decided to 'upgrade' to HP. I wish Dell were still making their Pocket PCs to replace this useless and expensive device.
0	does not live up to promise: A cute book, but contains very little information for all of its promise. The authors are busy making jokes but not talking about the nitty gritty of restoration. Maybe it is to hard to do since every job presents its own challanges. I just found the content thin. I am sorry I purchased it. If I could have found a copy in my local library, I would have saved some money.
0	More motivational than substantive: Although the book covers quite a bit in its 250-some pages, it lacks serious substance. While it motivates those in the administrative field to take charge and harbor an invincible positive attitude, it offers little direction or guidance beyond that. Noted in the Acknowledgements that the book was a 35-year work in progress, it shows. Many sections seem brief or entirely cut off with no direction or conclusion and the book flits through sections with no clear path. There's a lot of build up and no real answers to the questions that plague those in this profession. The entire book left me wanting to know more, but not giving me a whole lot I didn't already know.
0	RCBS130: I have not used it yet. I tried to balance the scale to zero, but I can't seem to keep it zeroed. The unit is mainly plastic and very light weight. At this point, I'm not impressed.
0	Worst movie ever: The acting and the script for this aAlfred Hitchcock movie are horrible. Save your money and order one of his later movies.
0	The 39 Steps: The VHS tape was inpossible to watch. I tried it on 2 different playback machines that were in perfect working condition and played other tapes just to see if the problem was in the machine or the tapes. I found that the problem was only with the 39 Steps, the tape I had just purchased.The speed of the tape was intermittant, that is is started out running too fast, changed back to a normal speed and then would speed up again. It was not possible to adjust the tracking ( on either of the two players I tried). I had hoped to send the tape as a present to a friend who is interested in old Alfred Hitchcock movies, but had to junk it instead. I ended up purchasing another version of the movies in DVD format from Amazon ( that was was perfect) to send to my friend.This was the first item that I have purchased through Amazon with which I was not pleased.The 39 Steps [VHS]
0	BE CAREFUL - ONLY BUY CRITERION EDITION: If you don't get the Criterion Edition, you will be getting an inferior transfer of this film: fuzzy images, fuzzier sound...yuck! The "bad" transfers include the one that Tony Curtis introduces.Again, look for the Criterion Edition.
0	Deep: This is a very hard read, very deep and one must truly truly be alone on an island to read this book
0	Ugggg...: I'm all for reading soul-searching materials, but this book was like pulling teeth - I felt it was translated (and poorly at that) so the sentence structure was long and difficult to follow; NOT that word choice was difficult or that it was above reading comprehension, far from it...some of the sentences just didn't make sense and I often lost their entire meaning.
1	The Power in Metaphors: Estes has provided a great service to us all by preserving and interpreting these archetypal stories that pass on the wisdom of the generations that precede us with regard to living, loving, rites of passage, and dying. Second only to Joseph Campbell's work (The Power of Myth) in it's power to explain many of the facets of our lives. As equally valuable to men as to women.
1	Beloved: I read the book first, but then listened to the audio, (a gift from a boyfriend that new how much I LOVED Women Who Run With the Wolves), and was delighted to discover not only Dr. Clarissa Pinkola-Estes youthful, pretty, and encouraging voice, but also new stories and commentary that were not in the book! For those who have not discovered Dr. Clarissa Pinkola-Estes and her vast collection of audio, I wonder if they will feel the connection to their souls as I instantly feel a connection to my soul each time I read her words and hear her voice. A priceless gift to oneself, a priceless gift for a loved one.
0	Prysock vs. Harvey: I ended up here because I was trying to see if Laurence Harvey's version of This Is My Beloved is available on CD. Alas, it does not appear to be. I am one of the lucky ones who ran across another vinyl of it a few years ago many years after losing my first copy and am listening to it as I write. As much as I love Arthur Prysock's voice, no one can TOUCH Harvey's version of this book and I have both! I would suggest checking stores that specialize is used/out of print albums for Harvey's version. No disrespect to Prysock, but you'll never listen to it the same way again!
1	great for what i do: This toy is great for customization as well as overall playing... I'm actually going to get another one just so I can customize an Ice cream van out of it... I recommend getting this if you customize toys... or as a gift for your kids
1	Standard Breakfast: I have been eating Erin's for Breakfast for over 2 yrs now. Very filling, taste is excellent. Good to take along when you're late for work as I usually am. A great all around breakfast. I like mine warmed up in the Microwave.
1	Good Stuff: It was because of the other graphic novel based in Arkham Asylum that I heard of this one. Sure enough, they are different. "Arkham Asylum: Living Hell" is definitely a most enjoyable book. The text is good, the drawing style is nice, and if you're Batman baddies, you'll find plenty.You'll see very little of Batman in there. The story is entirely based in Arkham and focuses on a new inmate in there, and various subplots involving other inmates, the classical Batman villains.I can't compare with other books based on Batman, because I only read one, but I sure can say this book is an enjoyable read.
1	Almost perfect Batman book: From the start I was enthralled. The art, the story, the atmosphere all had me captivated. I really enjoyed the drama tone Living Hell had. It didn't start out with a sense of action/adventure but more of a serious prison drama. It definitely had action especially towards the end but for the most part it was a drama about one guy who got stuck in Arkham Asylum.Other reviewers were also disappointed with the way the book turned out in the last chapter and I have to agree with them. It wasn't what I was expecting and all the while I was reading it I was kind of discouraged. But once I got to the last few pages I was like, "This totally rocks!". In my opinion it made up for all the "weirdness" that was in the last chapter.Overall It wasn't as psychological as Arkham Asylum: Serious House on Serious Earth but it gave a good feel for what life is like at Arkham Asylum.
0	should have gone with another flavor: DId not like the chocolate oatmeal raisin. wasnt very tasty. It is filling and wholesome but I would not buy again at this price.
0	Not worth watching--nothing Keaton put out really is and maybe never was: Like so many of Keaton's films it is more fun to wish you could watch them than it is to actually tune in.This film has one novelty only--the ship looks expensive. Beyond thet its as worthless as Keaton's cheap short films (of which there are two on this DVD). The films all usually have very little intelligence in scripts (though Battling Butler was almost a smart Keaton movie). The sets look like they cost about 50 bucks to make (on the shorts and almost every last one of his long films ---this movie only looks grand mostly because of the passenger ship--the sub at the end looks like a $10 prop set). Why did anybody think so many would want to warm up to this loser of an actor called Buster?
1	it works: what more do you need to know. Only 4 Stars because the unit responds a bit slowly to the remote control, but I don't think that's because it has been chipped; it's a design fault from Toshiba. Unit plays all region dvds with no fussing around. and the price is right.
1	Three women reflect on sandplay: If you've wondered what sandplay was all about from a Kalffian/Jungian perspective, these three women have a lot of wisdom to impart. Beyond "beginning sandplay" texts which provide a basic introduction to sandplay, this volume explores the essentials of sandplay while also going into depth about salient topics such as silence, the numinous, Self, and chaos. Based on conversations between these three elders of sandplay, similiarities and differences have been teased out to create a rich tapesty of the potential growth and healing inherent in sandplay. I highly recommend this book.
0	Good product bad deal: this is being sold for 5-8 dollars on most of the internet. word to the wise, buy this somewhere else.
0	Didnt work for me: I used the pest control product for cloth moths. I placed several of these around my house,1 in each closet, ect., but none of the 8 traps have caught any moths yet. Its been several weeks since I put these out in my house. I would recommend trying just one box, and see how that works for you. I unfortunately ordered several boxes at once hoping it would help, but so far, these havent caught any moths yet, but every coule days I see one or two still flying around the house.
0	DOES NOT WORK, DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY: This products is terrible and ineffective. We placed several around our home and only caught1-2 moths in each. Get the pantry moth trap in the red and yellow pack. It is wonderful. Moths multiply so quickly that you need a powerful attracting mechanism to get rid of them.
1	Safer pantry pest trap: After buying these traps in a local hardware store, I found them online at a reduced rate. They worked very well initially and did help to stop the cycle with the Pheromone attraction. But the pheromone seems to wear out in ten days. not weeks. However, that said, these simple easy traps took my home out of being moth infested, to having a few here and there. I recommend them highly.
0	Safer moth traps no longer work: I had been using Pantry Pest traps successfully for years. Recent purchases haven't worked at all! I will not buy them again.
0	Safer Pantry Pest Trap: I was unimpressed by this product. When I put this product out on my counter, the moths looked a little dazed and confused. Most flew near the trap, but less than10 percent got inside the trap, near the sticky part. The rest just kept flying around the kitchen. I also tried placing the trap inside the cabinet (with everything removed) with similar results. I would find moths within inches of the trap, but none inside.
1	Works but don't depend on it to rid the moths: We bought it to get rid our house of the Indian Meal Moth. These insects are pretty harmless but annoying and would turn up in flour/cereals etc. After setting up the trap, nothing happened for like 2-3 days and we would manually swat the moths. Later it managed to catch15-20 of these. But it would not attract all of them. We still had to go after them with brooms etc.
0	Did not do the job: The Pantry Pest did not work. The sticky adhesive missed most of the moths!! I actually trapped a moth in the triangle and it hit the sides of the trap--nothing! It bounced off them like it was super moth!! The lure is tiny and did not attract many moths. I would try other things first before buying this.
0	This product does not seem to be working!: I picked this product up at my local Ace Hardware store. I had high hopes for these traps, but they simply aren't working. The lure seems to work, but I haven't found one moth in either trap and they have been in place for three days now. The moths do fly around the traps and walk inside only to come right back out. I don't know if there is a problem with the glue or not (I didn't want to test it by touching it and compromising the product), but I do see tiny flecks of something on the glue pads. It's very frustrating to be out the money for these traps since they don't seem to be working. It's even more frustrating to see the moths still flying around.
1	Pantry moths and larvae: Found product to be effective. However, it will take at least three weeks to start seeing results.We had a moderate infestation.
1	So far, so good... but found elsewhere for less $$$!: Put it in my pantry tonight, and it caught 2 moths within15 minutes, so something is working!That being said, I actually bought this at Home Depot for only $5.78+tax! This really casts doubt on Amazon's claim that the list price is $11.11 ...
0	A dancer: Based on the reviews that were available last year, I bought this DVD, but I'm disappointed. I was expecting it to "dancier" than it is, and something about the production quality bothers me.
1	Nina the Torch Chanteuse--Highly Recommended: Nina's voice is like no other vocalist--the emotional intensity she brings to her covers and originals are non-pareleil. This "After Hours" CD (formerly on Philips, now Verve) is probably the best one that shows Nina in a "torch-chanteuse" mode. It is my co-favorite alongside the Jazz Masters on Verve. Nina's voice was at a creative peak. Each song stands out from the next. One could play this CD1,000 times and never get tired. Each time the listener discovers new depth and meaning in Nina's singing. I prefer Nina during this mid-60's period to her later stint at RCA when she became too blues-oriented and political.
0	If only I could vote "0 Stars": I am continually disappointed in Boy George. He has such potential, yet puts out what is in my opinion, pure crap. The songs on this album are dreadful. The lyrics are embarassingly poor and the music is the same bad glam rock as his last full album (which should have been scrapped with the out takes this album consists of). Boy George has done some brilliant vocals when put in the hands of producers like Faithless and the Pet Shop Boys, and his latest singles "When Will You Learn", and "Love Is Leaving". I was hoping he would release an album in that vein. In my opinion, Boy George should stick with electronics and dance music, and leave the the guitars in his garage.
0	I don't know anyone in this book!: Ok, having now finished the book, I am still giving it two stars. I still didn't know any of the characters in this book, but it leaves off with a major cliffhanger. The descriptions in this book are many and varied, the technical stuff is very technical and the descriptions about the people and their culture is very skimpy, especially about the Blood. I would've like to known more about this culture and what makes it tick, and why the Federation is out there in this area.Thanks for reading!~Pandora
1	mexican way: Well, this is in my opinion the best period of Mahalia's carrer (1955). Her voice is still strong and too expressive. The songs let her "touch" us in a special way. It's a good oportunity for young people to listen the background's soul singers.
0	Not DTS, Not even a good picture: I have learned a big lesson through the purchase of this video, some groups will show their fans respect and give them DTS with high quality video. Not the case here. This is simply a VHS version recorded to DVD. Not to brag but I could have done this in my basement and produced better quality. If you do not believe me, purchase this DVD then purchase the The Eagles - Hell Freezes Over. I guarantee you will want you money back.
0	could have been better: THIS IS ...GOOD FOR FANS WHO LIKE THE POPULAR STUFF, BUT DIE HARD FANS THE ONLY VIDEOS THAT ARE EXCITING ARE HUMANS BEINGS AND THE LIVE DREAMS, NOTHING ELSE IS RARE , THAT YOU HAVENT RECORDED A1000'S TIMES OFF MTV. THERS A LOT MISSING INCLUDING THE BLUE ANGELS DREAMS VIDEO AND QUITE A FEW OTHERS (NOTABLY111). GEEZ THEY COULD OF PUT ON SOME OLD LIVE VH STUFF, TO BE INTERESTING OR HAVE SOME INTERVIEWS.TIMES LIKE THESE I WISH I WAS A KISS OR BONJOVI FAN , THEY GET MULTIPLE VIDEOS WITH EACH ALBUMS, AND SEEM TO PUT SOME EFFORT INTO THEM .SINCE DAVE LEFT THE ENTERTAINMENT HAS DIED.
1	Please, let get it right.: First, this is a great DVD collection of some truly amazing Van Halen stuff. It's only an hour long, but the collection is a very well thought out and executed program, chronologically tracing their musical career, and spanning through all three lead vocalists: David Lee Roth, Sammy Hagar, and Gary Cherone.But I've got a bone to pick with other reviewers - come on, there's got to be some people out there that know what they're talking about. Everyone needs to stop abusing Gary Cherone. He is a truly talented singer, well worthy of the company he keeps. Van Halen III bombed for a lot of reasons, but as we all know, it's easiest to blame the lead vocalist - look at your own band. These people need to listen to Pornograffitti. Then I'll take their Cherone opinion with more interest. I mean look at the shoes he had to fill. I'm truly glad that he didn't try to sound like Hagar and Roth, and sounded like Cherone. That in itself commands a lot of respect.
1	I blurted out laughing so many times!! Mama Ruby is Madea: The narrator did such a fantastic job with bringing all the characters to life. The book is off the hook! Terrifying and funny at the same time. The story is crazy and makes me think about history. I sure hope people didn't live like this for real but I am sure they did. Mama Ruby thinks that satan is a low down, black, funky dog who has the strength of10 bulls! This is the real life Tyler Perry's Madea.
1	Pam's Opinion on The Upper Room: I just got finished reading The Upper Room by Mary Monroe and I have to say that I really enjoyed it. I was looking throughout the bookstore one day and stumbled upon it. It really wasn't my1st pick but I decided to give it a shot after reading God Don't Like Ugly and God Still Don't Like Ugly. I must say that the book really surprised me. When I first started reading the book I really wasn't that into it and would only pick it up when I was bored but by the end of the book I didn't want to put it down. I really like her style of writing and the book was really superb to me. I would recommend it to a friend.
1	**** EXCELLENT PAGE TURNER******: This book was so captivating!!! It kept my attention right from the start. I could not put the book down! I stayed up late at night and had to force myself to put it down, I wanted to finish it in one sitting it was so good. You really feel the pain for the main character Annette, how she was abused and ostracized by her classmates,her being protective of her mother, and her relationship with Rhoda her best friend. The author really knows how to tell a story, I highly recommend this book!!! I can't wait for Mary Monroe to write some more novels. I thoroughly enjoyed this book ...you will too!!!
0	Returned. Way too specific for my needs.: I'm a coach for an after school girls group that trains for a 5K at the end of a12 week program. I'm a school counselor, NOT a trained coach or PE teacher. I wanted some general advice about helping my elementary girls prepare for the 5K, hydration needs, Pre race meals, etc. This was waaaaaay too specific for me and not helpful in my case.
0	Smiley, Cheer Up!: Not to worry, President Bush will be re-elected in November and, I'm sure, will continue to tickle you pink with grammatical goofs. Afganistan and Irag are progressing toward democracy and you'll still be able to cash your government entitlements. Saddam Hussein has been captured but you personally are free to bash christians in our country. The U.S. will continue to be the greatest nation on the face of the earth but you'll continue to be free to advocate its takeover by the U.N. All of this should make you happy!
1	maximum WHO: In my opinion, "The Kids are Alright" it the best rock documentary ever. And that's because as originally presented, the material it covers and the way it handles the material is expert, right on the button, smoothly flowing, exciting, and informative, explosive stuff.But then, what happens? Well, if your music/rock-music appreciation is worth its salt at all, you want more, and in the case of the WHO, much, much more. And that's exactly what you get in this package: 2 discs chock-full of information and anecdotes you've always wanted or never (too bad, you're getting it) wanted to know...ah well, I guess that's not exactly true - I mean, if you're a far gone full-goosed Who fanatic, perhaps you'd like to hear about each and every single sordid detail of Pete's, Roger's, John's, and Moonie's exploits. Nevertheless, for the price of admission, this little package is powerfully packed...somewhat you might say, like a certain quartet from Shepherds Bush.
1	Bag It, a wake up call on plastics: Jeb Barrier is a likeable, interested guy who presents a serious subject in an enjoyable way. This is a well done examination of our plastic bag use, some attempts to curtail it and reasons why we must.
1	BRAVO! CHER!: This is one DVD you'll want to watch over and over again.As a child I grew up listening to Sonny & CHER.The songs from the 60's brought back memories,including the Sonny & Cher clips from the tv show.Cher is a true DIVA, and represents what a real DIVA is. This lady can put a show on from beginning to end!
1	We don't have Cher in Brazil: In fact, I want to buy this DVD because it isn't avaliable in Brazil, but my equipment is able just for discs from 4th region. If you have a disc with this configuration send me a e-mail. Thanks claudia
1	That's just how it is: I had a lot of fun seeing myself in many cartoons, I was laughing and crying at the same time.
0	Cheap, unreliable.: Radius Technology DVDs ID as "OPTODISC" brand media. (That is, OPTODISC makes the discs for Radius). OPTODISC media are generally found to be lousy: poor compatibility with many burners and many "coaster" (unreadable) burns. Amazon has high quality RIDATA blanks for a little more money. I highly recommend you buy them instead. Save yourself a lot of headaches and (if you store anything of importance) heartbreak. There really *IS* a significant difference between very cheap DVD media (like these) and better DVD media (like the Ridata).
0	Buy it from a department store: The La Mer Concentrate is great... but it doesn't cost anywhere near this much. Even Neimans sells it for less.
0	Misleading: This particular case does not allow you to open the phone to the internal keyboard as hinted in the description. You have to take the phone out of the case to do that. The company was really nice in replying to my inquiry though. Good thing it was cheap. I bought other things from them that worked out really well.
1	Can't wait for his next book...: I'm a little late getting to read this wonderful book, published in 2001, but am oh so glad I found it on the shelves.What a delightful read, couldn't put it down. When you laugh out loud and also shed a few tears you know you found the perfect book.Good Job, Jim KoKoris...keep 'em coming.Penny BurkeMt Laurel, NJ
1	Wrong color sent: The item itself is very good; however, I ordered 3 different colors, one of which you did not send (yellow rainbow). Instead, you sent 2 Medieval Blues and one Blue Hawaii. I was disappointed not to receive the color I had specified, especially since the girl that took the order stated that all 3 colors were in stock.
1	Not too seriously: This is a great book for lover's of vocabulary. As you can infer from the title, it doesn't take itself too seriously, and pokes fun at itself. It is a virtual treasure trove of wonderful nuanced words with clearly defined meanings, explained in a non-traditional, fun, and interesting way. Recommended.
1	A great book about a great pitcher!: I have almost no earthly idea why this book is out of print. It is one of the best books I've ever read. When I was in fifth grade, out teacher was giving away very old books from her bookshelves and I was just lucky enough to get one. This book tells Bob Gibson's grips and how he threw his pitches. And his accounts of major events in his career. If you can get ahold of one, lucky you!
1	Dying to have known DVD (Gerson Therapy): The Gerson Therapy represents the courage and unselfishness of one man, Dr. Max Gerson, to help the world with their fight against all disease. The fact that this information has been suppressed, plagurized and kept from the general public by our medical community and its associations is absolutely criminal and if our government wasn't so corrupt, it would be corrected as it should've been when Dr. Gerson presented it to our Senate many, many years ago.Japan is using it and so is Europe to cure cancer and many other diseases and yet most of the people in America are still having chemotherapy presented to them as though it's the only way to cure cancer.
0	Great service but . . .: the tape was in poor condition that had streaks through some of the tape. That information should have been stated in the description.
1	Excellent analysis of Knowledge Management: Ms. Dixon does an excellent job of describing knowledge management and its role in making an organization more successful. Through the various models she builds, she makes it clear when to use which model and more important, for a technical person like myself, when to use technology and when not to use it. In these days when everything has a technological solution, it is refreshing to see a perspective that positions technology as the tool that it is. Excellent!
0	What an unpleasant surprise ...: Yes the concept of the book, a Victorian novel of a young girl married to a much older man, an unscrupulous publisher no less, led me to dish out the big bucks and buy this book ....If they said this book was steamy, it certainly was, but, the steam came from me in having to read this mush. I think they should have announced this book as ANTI VICTORIAN literature since sensuality is hinted at but never touched. Thats why I rate this book with one star since you can't have serious relationships and marriage between people that are decades appart in age without some sort of spice. The fact that the man in the book is a scumbucket is even more reason to delvelop this as a reality...Well yes theres the word .. reality .. which is what this book does not have."Experiences of a young girl growing to maturity" is what the covers says ... what it should say is that this is so boring and meant for readers that think watching grass grow is exciting!
0	Why Isn't The 2009 Anniversary Edition Widescreen Format???: The old Dvd from 2001/2003/2005 (whichever!) states its Widescreen Format(1:85.1) with a Running Time of 93 min and Rated-R.The 2009 reissue DVD says its full frame with a Running Time of 91 mins and Unrated. (???)I'm glad that this release date got pushed back until January 2010 so that maybe I'll just cancel the new reissue order that I placed, and order an older DVD print from a private collector instead!This makes absolutely NO SENSE to me!?Can someone PLEASE shed some light on this for me if I am 'mistaken'?
1	good slasher: instead of the lack of creativity that most slashers have this film is good. the style is wonderful and the charecters are real. they really got good actors for this movie. has lots of twists and you can tell where i know what you did last summer got there idea. the film had some scary parts. i would recomend this.
1	It's the greatest book about AST I've ever read !: There's everything about breed history, housing, training and making your AST healthy and happy. And I like pictures and humorous comments.
1	One of the best movies of all time: If you haven't seen CASABLANCA, you're in for a real treat. Not only is it a love story but it's a thriller set in Vichy France Casablanca with intrigue and broken hearts. And, unlike many movies that started out with good intentions, this baby delivers in all areas, even story.Some real twists and a great surprise ending. A real gem. Hold on to this one and love it.
0	Did not know it did not download to your device.: Since I am in an area that does not have good internet service I am unable to watch the movie I purchased. I thought it downloaded to the kindle for a period of time to watch at your convience. I will know in the future not to purchase any.
0	Casablanca: My disc is bad; It would not get past the 8th scene. I probably need to buy a new one --from somewhere else.
1	Great movie!: This movie is a must-see for folks of all ages! I can't believe I had never seen it before. Wonderful love story.
1	Great film, good DVD: First of all: Mister " thebadgercarlton ", Widescreen wasn't invented yet in1942!Fullscreen is the only original ratio for Casablanca.Casablanca is one of the greatest films ever and the DVD is good, but the film really needs restoration, especiallyin scene No13.
1	A movie fan's dream..film noir and romance combined.: What is striking about the movie first is its setting: The waystation between Nazi Europe and America. The characterization is excellent. Bogart and Bergman play opposite each other extremely well, and Claude Rains is absolutely fabulous. Rains is witty, well played, and his humor is well timed and dry as a bone. All around, there isn't one person who plays his/her character poorly. Even extras with one line contribute to the movie's overall greatness. See it. Overall, an excellent movie with a good story, and a GREAT ending.
0	How should I put this?: I hate this movie. Its not even a movie, more of a waste of time. I've wasting too much time writing this review already. THIS IS NOT A CLASSIC! It doesn't even qualify as bad or horrible! See CITIZEN KANE a million times (no really, a million) before you see this one. If I could just leave all the stars blank, then maybe I could begin to do it justice.
0	If you love this film, don't buy this DVD.: The Greatest American Film is destroyed by a choice of a critic who is chosen to do the commentary in this DVD set. How can they let Roger Ebert, which is considered the most stupid American critic nowadays, be a part of this masterpiece?
1	Casablanca: A marvelous movie with all the foreign intrigue you could want.A true love story wrecked by war.The movie worked very well and I feel great about this purchase.
1	I Bought this as a gift: I got this for my Father, he liked it & mentioned if the movie lasted 5 more minutes he would have had gotten cancer from all the smoking!LOL! Now that would cause a R Rating!!!!
0	fornication: same old story. immorality. fornication between rick and the chick. and what happened after this? bergomeister went and committed adultery and her children suffered for it. don't think satan has only been around since the beatles. he's been plying his trade for millennia. who paid to see it? rotten americans. they gratified their lust, and the movie made money. and the tale kept spinnin'. satan's got a real racket. bergomeister and bogey fell for his tricks and are you know where now. they were satan's pawns, just like america is. love of money, by mr. warnermeister, is the root of all evil. corrupt movie used by seducing spirits (demons) to lead the world to hell.
1	Love this movie: I had always wanted to see this movie and when I found it for the price I did I could not pass it up. It is truly one of the great character pieces I have ever seen. I would recommend this to anyone, even if you don't like romance movies this one is still worth a watch.
1	A Package of Nostalgia: What a wonderful gift! A numbered souvenir box containing "Casablanca" on 3 DVD's, 2 of which are on Blu-Ray (viewer take note) with footage of the Warner Brothers' history as trendsetters of the early history of movie making. Comes complete with a poster and a coaster to impress your friends when you host a "Casablanca" party - be sure to wear Ingrid's hat!
1	Fantastic old movie!: I rented Casablanca as I hadn't seen it in years. I downloaded it onto my Kindle Fire and watched it on a long airplane flight. It was great!
1	Hookah: The hookah is great. The delivery was fast and the company was very helpful. They called and explained the various tobaccos and helped me pick some out.
1	I Love Steve Coogan...: and this was another jewel. Many of Coogan's characters aren't that familiar to U.S. audiences so this was a trove of unexpected fun. Hope I can see him live and in person someday.
1	beyound the sea of ice: a very interesting book that follows a simular theam to Auel but is much more exciting and with less romance, which i am happy for, i never liked romance stories
1	Best Illustration book I could ever wish for..: "Creative Illustration" is an amazing book. It is extremely useful, advice given in the book is exceptional. Most things discussed and showcased in this book I have never seen in any other art books (contemporary or vintage). Unique. Unbelievably good.This book made me a better artist, and I feel like now I understand everything with so much more depth.Loomis also gives a little insight in master Pyle's methods, compositions and advice for success in the industry that is still valid today.Best investment of a hundred dollars I've ever made. A definite must have for a professional, a gem for the serious student of illustration.(Note: This book is not for beginners. It's for people who are serious about the business. If you're just starting out, just get one of those "how to draw (insert whatever) books" and come and get this book in a couple of years.)
1	Grill skillet: This is a great item to stir fry of vegetables or shrimp over the grill. I love the detachable handle which makes it easy to take the skillet off and on when using on the grill. The pan cleans up easily.
0	did not work: product did not work. wanted it to download music but it would never sync with computer it wouldn't charge the device either
1	Pretty, dainty, worth your penny, but...: The set was agreeable in appearance I felt they were exactly what I had been looking for. They came precisly as advertised I was happy for some weeks. But, just like the fire opal set I bought at the same time as these, something in my skin did not approve and I suffered itchy ears and red, scab like skin, underneath the place holder on the back. I can assume the place holders were of the same make as the stud itself, but something about the opal set and this set made my ears painful. I'll just save them and have them cleaned to give them as a gift to some one with less sensitive ears than mine.
0	Too much revenge.: Not much of a story. There is sympathy for the main character but too much repetition of the hurdles involved. At times the "revenge" theme just isn't enough of a story, and there is no more to the plot.
0	Not worth buying: If you are a thinking person, this book is not for you. I could not finish the book, it just could not draw me in. It is comparable to a daytime soap opera, and I am not a fan of soap operas.
1	Excellent Album: This is an excellent album, not only because Dee Dee is a fantastic singer, but also because she was able to provide some of the first vocal versions of many of the tunes. Nica's Dream is amazing with vocal precision most singers fall short of delivering. Lonely Woman is haunting and melodic. Overall, this is a fantastic album.
0	Not a bit of freshness to Horace Silver's masterwork!: Musical projects based on singing lyrics to jazz standards are not to my taste. Just because they usually do not add a least bit of motivation and artistry to the original instrumentals. Horace Silver is a particular victim of that situation. In other words, I do not know any vocalized effort on his extraordinary work worth listening to except Mark Murphy's "That's how I love the blues" ... All Blue Note albums by Horace Silver - the great composer, pianist and combo leader - ... I'd rather have them all. Make your choice.
0	Offset dialog screens: Story and picture quality aside, it is very annoying that the film seems to have been transferred off center. From the opening titles to the dialog boxes, anywhere from one to three letters of the printing are missing on the left side of the screen. I guess you get what you pay for.
1	Great wave board: My grandchildren asked me to order this for them to give as a surprise to their mother who, after they each recieved a wave board for Christmas, taught them how to ride them. She enjoyed riding and occassionally would monopolize their wave boards, so they decided she needed her own. SHE LOVES IT.The board is exactly as described and functions as expected and needed.
1	very fun: I bought this for my10 year old for his birthday - it was too big for him, so I then bought the smaller wave ripple (wave ripple) for him, and he convinced me to keep this one for myself. We've both had a great time learning to ride it. It took about a day to learn. I'd also recommend real protective gear - and not riding downhill. At all. Ever. (from experience)
0	fun, while it lasted....: Yes, this is a new kind of sports toy for the kids to ride. Great for using your body and balance. Was ok for the first 2 weeks, then we noticed that the back wheel especially, was flaking away and chunks were falling off of it. Made for a very bumpy ride. Tried to replace the wheels by ordering new ones, but do to command for them they are back ordered? Not really sure, when we are to receive them. So it worked for the first 2 weeks and now it sits. Didn't think it was too expensive at the time of purchase, but for something that can't be used, I wouldn't have paid what we did for it and have it fall apart so soon.
0	Cheap Plastic that Cracks from normal use: I bought one of these several years ago. I was riding it within a few minutes. I am an adult (under 200 lbs) and don't do anything fancy with it. I noticed after riding on occasion over a few weeks that small hairline cracks started forming on both platforms where the torsion bar inters the plastic. This is not properly engineered and I would guess that someone doing tricks on this board could easily break the plastic.
1	GIVES PEACE OF MIND: I am very happy with this product as it gives me assurance and peace of mind that all of my photos will last (at least) my lifetime on these discs (or so they promise). It has been difficult for me to locate any "archival" quality discs in local stores. Once I found out that other (cheaper/regular) discs may lose data over time, I freaked. I only found out about "archival quality" discs by accident on Amazon. After using them (and reading the description), I felt confident enough in these to actually "delete" several GIGS of yearly photo albums from my computer into my recycle bin AND then, permanently delete THAT from my computer! Now that's confidence! Anyone who knows me and my picture taking OBSESSION would be the first in line to buy these, if they needed them!
1	Learning can be fun!: I purchased this for my 4 year old when she started telling me she wanted to learn how to "tie shoes like a big girl". She was excited to start as soon as we received the book, and continues to practice. The poem inside is cute and the laces easy to work.
1	Where to purchase this book (and PDF) online...: This book (under the name "MMURTL V1.0") can be found on Sensory Publishing's website:http://www.sensorypublishing.com/mmurtl.htmlYou can purchase a PDF of the book (and the source of the OS itself), or pay extra for a printed copy in addition to the PDF. (My original review was truncated before the URL for some reason.)
1	So well written, I felt as if I was Vyry.: Best book I have ever read. I recommend this book to everyone, young and old. I am so glad my dad named me after such an intelligent and strong black women.Vyry Marie Herrington
1	Loki does it again: I've recently downloaded the demo. It contains the first 2 maps of the windows version (which I also own). The gameplay is great! I'm using Linux X4 with a 3D Prophet GTS 2, using nvidia's Linux drivers.
1	Q-Copy Replacement Cartridge: This is the first time that I have used the Q-Copy Replacement Cartridge in my Canon PC (E-40). The price was reasonable and I am satisfied with the quality of copies that I have made so far. I recommend this brand for routine copying. I have no complaints and intend to purchase it again!!!
0	Suck(s): Don't waste your money. This movie Sucks. Iggy and Alice, are about the only redeeming qualities here. The only way this will ever be a cult classic, is if you are in a cult and your leader forces you to watch it.
0	Directions are AWFUL: Ordered this based on the product name. The directions are horrendous and make no sense. It is cheaply made and I had to rig it up in order to have the basket sit on the side of the pan as they said.. I would NOT recommend this item!!
0	Pretty but lame: This unit performs well while it lasts, but mine only lasted a few months when using with care. I do not jog. The unit stayed in my car the whole time. It just stopped working.
1	Really worth the price: This cute discman manufactured by Koss have a 40 sec memory for the hard bus time. The overall sound quality is ok and there's a bass boost option that work very well. Beside the cool design, I have to admit that the headphones are not the finest one but remember that price of this Koss player is the Panasonic and Sony 40 sec. models price divided by two !
0	KOSS is a terrible CD player: KOSS is a good bargain if their products actually worked over the long haul. BUT THEY DON'T! Trust me, or you will pay with a couple of 20's and your sanity. I am not the only one, my cousin purchased the same KOSS CD player and one month later he threw it off a 5 story apartment building balcony. It's a piece of crap.
1	Great CD Player!: This CD player is great! IT looks cool, doesn't skip, has the best sound quality I've ever heard, and it's cheap!
0	1 pen, not12.: The description says you get12 pens, but you only get one. Yes $1.90 is a fair price to pay for1 pen, but if I had known it was only one I certainly would not have paid $7.46 for them to mail me one pen! Sounds a little too much like a scam to me. The seller was good enough to refund my money after I contacted them, so if you have bought this pen thinking you would get12, definately contact them and demand a refund. They certainly aren't in any hurry to correct the description as it has been over a month since I bought it and it still says12 pens.Regarding the pen itself, it is far from perfect. It will occasionally spurt out a large amount of paint onto your work with no warning, making a mess of everything, including your clothes. Other than that, the colors are good and when it doesn't squirt it works pretty good.
1	One of my favorite movies: I love action comedy flicks, especially if Bruce Willis is in it. And this one, this movie, is one of the best examples of such genre, another being the Die Hard, of course. The very end of the movie may feel like too smoochy but you can't win 'em all, right?
1	An excellant book for all ages and nationalities: I love reading it, it brings back my childhood, several passages even made we cry as I thought of my Nonna.However, we have a great time reading it with our granddaughrer (12) in the morning with bsicotti and coffee/milk.
1	Great IS and Bokeh: With this lens, I can capture very nice pictures of my kids/nephew/niece. The IS work wells. Handling is good. Bokeh is what I expected.The only thing that I like to have is the Full-Time Manual Focus which it doesn't have.
0	A Solid Lens with drawbacks: This was one of my first lens purchases. I initially enjoyed it however as I became more and more serious about photography I found that this lens was not producing the quality I was looking for. For one, the chromatic abberation at the long end was terrible when the image was viewed at100%. Secondly, when shooting wide open, the images are soft although stopping down a stop or two corrects this. I ended up trading this lens in towards the purchase of an EF 70-200 f/4L IS USM lens.This lens, however, is not a complete loss. The 3-stop IS is fantastic and the focusing is relatively fast and accurate. I would suggest people just starting out on a tight budget purchase this lens if the higher end lenses are simply out of reach especially if you don't plan on making outlandishly huge prints from your photos. That said, if I had to relive this purchase, I would have held out for a lens with a higher resale value and higher quality.
1	The Canon EF 70-300 mm IS is a GREAT lens for the price!!: Bought this lens a few months ago and have been very happy with all the photos since. I don't think you can take a bad picture with this lens. I've taken everything from drag racing pictures of dragsters going 320 MPH, to beautiful zoomed-in shots of flowers and butterflies with amazing results. Can't buy a better lens for the price. It focuses super fast and always takes clear shots. You'll love it !!
1	great: i feel like paparazzi, this is fantasticworked WONDERS while photographing my last wedding; it was like i was standing at the altar with themrecommend
1	Awesome Lens Great Price!!: I had the 70-200 L F/4 usm without the IS, I returned that lens. Without IS it was not worth keeping for me, to many blurry pictures(must be on a tripod) So I exchanged it for this 70-300 IS USM about the same price too. Love it!! Made it all worth while. It's pretty good at up close, not a macro lens. Great with 300mm, Clear and sharp at all ranges. nice walk around lens for me. Very Happy with this purchase.
1	Great lens: Thrilled to see the price drop and I'd been waiting for the telephoto lens for awhile. I weighed the pros and cons of getting this one for my Canon 40d vs an L series lens but decided in the end that this would do nicely in the meantime. I took some excellent shots through my kitchen window of some baby birds and was very pleased with the detail.
0	Over priced...: This lens sells new at Best Buy for $500+, the price they show before the 51% cut is way out of focus... Has never sold for $900+, not even on the Canon Direct web site..
1	Makes Guero look thin....: ...and I gave Guero 5 stars. Beck does it again. DVD is awesome as well. Of all the "keepers of real", Beck keeps it the realest.
0	a mulligan: Putting the stickers on the cover was a wicked blast. It took me 20 minutes and I was so proud of my project, I scanned it and sent it to my mom.The music is typical Beck, the funky side. No "Sea Change" or "Mutations" here. It's perfect background noise, too, for like if you're scrubbing your floors or working on a paper or smoking up.I gave it1 star because the DVD that accompanies the package is the single most self-indulgent tripe I have ever seen in my entire life. Beck is capable of so much better and THAT'S why I feel so put out. and taken advantage of. But it's ok, everyone's entitled to a few mistakes and in a career like Beck's, there haven't been many. I'll give him a mulligan.
0	Cumbersome and cheap: Forget this camera. After owning several digital camera's over the years and knowing how to operate them after only a couple of days it takes constant programming for every picture you take in order to get a good photo. This is not the camera for just grabbing and taking a photo. It requires thought and total concentration to just get an acceptable photo. I'd buy an off the shelf Kodak from Kmart before buying this one again.
0	The Camera that wasn't: I cannot review this product for you because the seller has never sent it to me. Nor has my money been returned. I am very disgusted with the whole business. It's too bad. It looked like a good camera.
0	worst movie ever!!!!!!: don't waste your money one of the worst movies I have ever seen no plot, vague story line, just terrible
1	Too Large: I had to return this card because it wouldn't fit in the available computer space. So I really did not have a chance to use it. I have an HP 8760C. The card is about10 inches long. So just make sure you measure the available space.
1	Better than the original: It pains me to say that. But these instrumentals are much better than the versions with vocals. Sorry dude, but you're not a great singer. "Clean Living" was awesome. But that doesn't mean you have to sing on every track. Stick to what you do best: making beats. For other vocalists. Or, as is the case here and on most of his best older songs, instrumentals. If you didn't like 'The Third Hand' before, give this one a shot. I consider it the better album.
0	Good Product money wise but not Safe: I am very much impressed with the quality of the Leather Pouch from my new Treo . I was very happy of the same . However While traveling as it was hooked to my trouser , my Treo fell down twice from this Pouch . As it does not have a Locking Facility , It creates a Problem . It has just a Magnetic flap which is of no use when your Expensive Treo Falls down Twice and has a Lot of Scratches on them . Hence if they would only have a Locking facility on the Flap it would be great.
1	Very, Very Good CD.......: ....I was very impressed with this CD. I had heard of this band, but never purchased their first CD. Though, now after listening to this one, I will get my hands on whatever this band has released. I would love to see them in concert. I can't wait till them come to Ohio!
1	Like the mat, love the length: This mat's color pretty much resembles the picture, a pastel green. Being 5'9", I love the length of the mat and have no problems with any poses. The thickness vs the weight is right-on for my needs. I would prefer something just a *little* more thicker for my knees, but I wouldn't want anything heavier for classes.The mat does tend to slip a little bit in the beginning, but it wasn't too bad. You can just use a yoga towel if you tend to be a heavy sweater (I'm not at all, and I only had slippage problems with my hands in downward dog)Overall, I think this was a nice mat at a great price.
1	Very pleased: The process was very quick and easy. My book arrived quicker than I expected and was in excellent condition.
1	Victims No Longer: This is an excellent book. I am a counselor and the issues addressed regarding male child sexual abuse are so important. So many males have been molested and/or incested and carry shame, so that they, perhaps more than females, do not report it. Yet, these unresolved issues carry into adult sexual and friendship relationships until they are healed. I bought a copy for myself to use clinically and one for a friend who is a survivor of incest.
0	Unsatisfied: I am not satisfied with the item i purchased from you. The item frequently freezes and stops, making it difficult to play. It does this everytime i try to play. It's still malfunctioning and i would love if you help to resolve the issue. I really had my plans on enjoying a game of Sims 2, but this game will not function correctly. Ever since i received the package it has been malfunctioning incorrectly. I will not play and constantly stops and freezes up. I would LOVE a full refund if you cant resolve the issue. Thanks.
1	A MUST READ FOR EVERYONE!: Absolutely my favorite novel. It's a long one, but everyone should read it...men and women. Not only is is accurate historically, but it is also educational and interesting. The novel is far richer than the movie, and although the motion picture is a spectacle....the book puts the movie to shame. Read the book, and watch the movie again afterwards. The differences are astounding....but that is what keeps the novel interesting to modern readers. It's isn't the exact story we have seen on film on TCM again and again. Again, everyone should read this book. It has literary value, historic value, and pleasure value.
1	gone with the wind: One of my all time favorite books, one I have read several times. A true classic. It brings the South to life.
0	A wannabe "War & Peace.": Written during the Great Depression when Americans needed escapism, GWTW and the resulting movie it spawned are primarily responsible for distorting many Americans impressions of slavery, as well as trivializing the horror of the Civil War. If you like your history covered with moonlight and magnolias and sugar-coated beyond all reality GWTW is just what you are looking for. After all, its only fiction. Problem is, too many people over the years have come to regard it as almost gospel. In the end, GWTW is little more than a cheap attempt to create an American version of Tolstoy's "War & Peace."
1	The Best Book Ever: My paper back is barely going to withstand another reading since I have nearly worn it out. I actually read the book before seeing the movie. I was very disappointed! The movie made Scarlett seem so evil, but in the book she depicted more as a strong woman who did what she had to do to survive. The only thing that would be better than reading this book again, would be to have the audio version so I could listen to it in the car.
1	Used but Good Book: The copy is a1940's print, and is definitely used.I would have liked a bit more info in its cover condition, (It had parts of the original in a plastic protective sleeve) and the book was very musty.However, the pictures inside were beautiful and the book itself was in good condition.It made a wonderful present for my GWTW obsessed friend.Now to see if I can find myself a copy...
0	It didn't work and spoilt my coffee maker as well: Well, I am pretty disappointed with this prodcut as it spoilt my new Krups coffee maker as well. Its supposed to take loads of upto1600 Watts but my1200 Watt coffee maker was apparently too much for it to handle.
1	great gift for soon-to-be moms: I bought this and a few other Bella B items for my sister-in-law who is expecting; she loves all of the products.
0	.: This book was just not for me. I don't see the sun let alone the beach...that should have been my first clue.
0	Not for every taste.: I'm not into this eccentric approach of this major work. After having a long tradition of superb recordings of thissymphony by Karajan (1963), Fricsay, Furtwängler, Abendroth and Bernstein (DG), this Celi bizarre reading could be a bitof shocking to anyone. If you are fond of a weird phrasing and tempi, deliberate rubato and bizarre unbalance, this couldbe your perfect choice.
0	Ended up not liking Bobby Fischer: I must respect Bobby Fischer as a player. But I learned some stuff that doesn't make me respect him as a person. I have read more things about Fischer which this book leaves out and should have been put in.
1	A Good Sample: This is a good sample of swinging tunes Mulligan recorded with other top notch saxophonists. A nice blend of standards and Mulligan originals. The highlights are the Zoot Sims-Mulligan and Paul Desmond-Mulligan teams. Favorite tunes are 'Chelsea Bridge,18 Carrots For A Rabbit, and Line For Lyons." Fine out of production sampler of some of Mulligan's brightest moments. If you can find yourself a copy, highly recommended.
1	THE1.33:1 ASPECT RATIO WAS HOW IT WAS INTENDED: Some customers here, according to their reviews, suggest not buying the DVD because it is not in the widescreen format. According to Donald Richie's "The Films of Akira Kurosawa," the definitive analysis of his filmography (film by film), Kurosawa did not work with the widescreen format until1958 with "Hidden Fortress". So "Samurai" is shown in its original format on Criterion's DVD. Hope that clears up the confusion.
1	Great collection for a film buff !: Any time a Criterion Collection edition of a DVD comes out, it is usually worth the few extra bucks it will cost you.This presentation of "Seven Samurai" is fantastic. Great features on the 3rd disc, and the book is great reading.If you want to call yourself a REAL movie buff, this has to be on your shelf !
1	One of the greats...: A cinematic giant, now on DVD.Probably the best movie to ever come from the east, and the basis for some of the great American westerns.
0	The template: Like many of Akira Kurosawas films this is a template for basic storytelling that has been referenced, borrowed or used over and over again. Truely a masterpiece.
1	A great story: There are many accolades and volumes of in depth analysis for this film, so my review will be short.The good: Strong, weak, sad, wise, frail, crazy, calm, etc; the full gamut of characters that really work together to twist complex situations. The story keeps you guessing first time. It is timeless and the subitles did not bother me...because the pace of the movie is easy enough to keep up with reading but also watching.The bad: It can move too slow at times and I had to break up the film and view over two nights.Conclusion: This is a movie I will watch again, probably a few times if lucky.
1	One of the top ten best films -EVER.: Not only one of the best Samurai films, but one of the most perfectly made films ever! The story is well made, the realistic characters are played by powerful actors (one of them being Toshiro Mifune), with lots of drama, humor, philosohpy AND all in 207 minutes! What more could you ask for? Oh, don't forget the ACTION!The DVD, of course, also has extras, like audio commentary and the original US theatrical trailer.
1	Unforgettable: This is absolutely the best movie to be filmed. Ever. I have seen a ton of movies but this was the best. Even though it has a simple storyline, it's a very complicated film. The characters are very well developed, Kurosawa is a born genius. It runs over 3 hours, but it is so interesting that you WILL keep watching it! It has action, humor, suspense and much more.The story is set in the1600's in a small village. The village is constantly being robbed of their crops by bandits and the townsfolk want to hire unemployed samurai to defend themselves, only giving them food instead of money. Enjoy the film, you will love it.
1	And you thought kids watch teen movies!: I first saw this movie on the action channel. I remembered it and bought it on a DVD. Me, being a fan of these samurai movies, loved it. Great acting, phenominal battle scenes, and cool sword slashing samurai. If you like samurai movies,16th century Japan, played and liked Onimusha: Warlords and Shogun: Total War, buy this. Oh yeah...I once saw this samurai film on the Bravo Channel. It was about the Takeda Clan and the Uesugi Clan. At the end there was this battle, I think it was the battle of 4th Kawanakajima. At the end it showed the Takeda Shingen and Kenshin Uesugi fighting in a pond. Then after Shingen was injured, Kenshin went away with his calvary in an arrow formation going against the wave of Yari spearmen going back to camp. If you know what the name of this movie is...post a review on this page that tells the name....Thanks.
1	The best movie ever made: This is the best film of Akira Kurosawa and the best film ever made. Citizen Kane is as good as this movie, but cannot make you feel the same emotion. The history of the cinema never was the same after Seven Samurais.
1	Check the original aspect ratio nefore you complain...: I'm sick of all the people that complain "Why isn't it in letterbox/widescreen?!! I can't believe they butchered it and put it in fullscreen!" etc. It was shot in1.33:1 ratio, and its displayed here in its original ratio, so before you complain about it and give them grief, know what you're talking about. All it takes is a little google search or god forbid a look at the box where it says "original aspect ratio..."...and I never thought that sitting through 3+ hours of a 50s Japanese film would fly by faster than most of the1.5 hour movies I see today. I was never board for a second. But I can see how it may not be some people's thing. Since Criterion are expensive, just give it a rent first.
0	didnt like it.: didnt like this movie at all. did not find it beautiful, did not find any of the characters even remotely interesting. in fact if you asked me i could not tell you who the main character was. Kurosawa was praised for his camera work, in showing all the major characters, but that's exactly the problem. yes the characters were major but WHO was the main? also, for a film that sets the standard for action films, ive watched almost all of it (prolly1 hour lefT) and havent seen one fighting sequence. or anything.
0	One of the most boring movies ever!: I guess I should preface this by saying that I'm really not an Asian-movie person. I just don't "get" them, and I'm sure it's a cultural thing. "Tampopo," "Crouching Tiger," "In the Realm of the Senses" and now this one -- I couldn't sit through any of them. Unless you are a martial arts or samurai fanatic, or a big lover of Japanese culture and history, I would say definitely skip this -- especially if you are female. I think this is one of those "Emperor's New Movies" that we're all supposed to like, and no one will admit to NOT liking it for fear of being thought ignorant!
1	A Monument to the Writing Life: No cartoon series is followed more closely by writers than Peanuts and no dog understands writers better than Snoopy. Writers love the Snoopy cartoons but most writers will be amazed that there are so many of them. Now you can have a complete collection.Barnaby Conrad is the director of the Santa Barbara Writer's Conference. Charles Schulz drew huge crowds each time he spoke there.As an author, I will treasure this very special book.Dan Poynter, ParaPublishing.com
0	CAREFUL: Cheap, yes. But these are low quality media: Radius Technology DVDs ID as "OPTODISC" brand media. (That is, OPTODISC makes the discs for Radius). OPTODISC media are generally found to be lousy: poor compatibility with many burners and many "coaster" (unreadable) burns. Amazon has high quality RIDATA blanks for a little more money. I highly recommend you buy them instead. Save yourself a lot of headaches and (if you store anything of importance) heartbreak. There really *IS* a significant difference between very cheap DVD media (like these) and better DVD media (like the Ridata).
0	As a teacher, I found the "sports coach" tone distracting.: There are already dozens of creative writing "how to" books on the market...Why make a student spend this much for a book that's overloaded and at times condescending.
0	Disappointed: First of all, the rating I gave this DVD is based on the poor quality of the tape transfer not the movie itself. I happen to enjoy this movie.I would rate it 4 stars. When you have Errol Flynn, Olivia DeHavilland, President Reagan, and an outstanding performance by Raymond Massey, how can you go wrong? Yes, it's not a historically accurate by and large. But who cares? And really how many Hollywood produced movies are? Just kick back and enjoy this piece of pure escapism. A western full of colorful characters set during the days prior to the Civil War with glorious names (e.g; Jefferson Davis, Robert E. Lee, George Armstrong Custer, J.E.B Stuart, John Brown, etc.) from our American history. However, the tape transfer is horrible. It's grainy and dark in some scenes. It's hard to watch. And there are no extras to it. I would recommend to avoid buying this Synergy Archive Series copy. Let's hope Warner Bros. decides one day to restore this film and market it.
1	High on the list of movies that p**s off liberals: While this movie seems to flaunt its disregard for historical accuracy, it's still a fun adventure romp with several well known figures from American history. Errol Flynn as JEB Stuart is a blast as he battles straight-arrow rival Ronald Reagan (George Custer) in love and war. Raymond Massey is chilling as homicidal maniac John Brown and Olivia De Havilland is a peach. The whole film is refreshing for its unapologetic rejection of the post-bellum political orthodoxy imposed on the whole country which beatified John Brown and sanctified the Glorious Cause that slaughtered some 600,000 Americans. I'm sure it must have raised some eyebrows even in1940, never mind today. In all, it's a fun movie which gains a lot of extra points for its delightful political incorrectness.
1	Great for Travelers: I recently came back from a trip to Australia. Not only was this book invaluable for everyday communication, but the section on Australian slang saved me from being totally lost when talking to Aussies. A must for any traveler to a country where British English is spoken. The comprehensive list of word comparisons make this a serious reference book, but the expressions and idioms are what make this book fun to read! Explanations on acronyms such as ZIP code and Amtrak, as well as unraveling the mystery as to why Americans drive on the right and Brits on the left make this a great book for resolving disputes. My only criticism is that I would have liked to have seen a few more of the humorous illustrations which help to lighten up the book.
0	A Semi-Interesting Mess: The book is largely a glossary - perhaps almost half - which doesn't exactly make for Interesting reading. Some terms were terribly out of date, others wildly obscure, and at worst, just plain useless and random. I love both the UK and language, and I found this book a badly done bore. Also, shame on the publisher for the crappy formatting. I finished about 60% of it before giving up, and I normally eat this stuff up.
1	Love it or Hate it, It's Still Great Prose: I enjoyed this book and it was well written. It's a nice reflection of spirit of the time and it's well constructed. I've noticed that people either love or hate this book, but I'm wondering how much of the reaction of those who hate it is due to false expectations based on the movie Stone Reader. I think this book will appeal to those who enjoy literary writers similar to James Joyce and love reading well fashioned prose. However, if you're searching for a book that will change the way you think about the world or this piece of American history, you may be disappointed. The book is excellent for what it is: beautiful prose about a writer's experience growing up in a culturally empty place in a particular time.
0	Not Believable: The book is unbelievable as in NOT believable. No way is it reality to beleive eight-year-old boys in Iowa, in early1950s, would know, much less use such language.
0	You have to love this book: When I found this book in the book store and read the cover it sounded like a very good read. After looking over some of the pages I was a bit taken aback by some of the prose but thought it would turn out to be a good read. I was wrong.You have to love this book to finish it. I struggled through several tedious pages trying to figure out what the heck Mossman was trying to say, finally giving up and putting it away.The characters weren't very well explained and the conversations they have are just plain boring. Mossman's descriptive style reminded this reader of the hippy-speak of the sixties. It didn't make sense then and it doesn't make any now.
0	Adobe InDesign CS2@work: This book would only suit a desktop publisher rather than a Prepress or Graphic Designer, I found it failing in the concept of Type and general overall usage.
1	This book is fantastic.: I have long wanted to cook Indian at home, and this book has helped me do that (well!) I have made several recipes from this book, the most notable being the "Heavenly Korma" which far exceeded any Korma I have had in a restaurant. I am so glad to have come across this book, and I'm sure I'll refer to it for years to come.
1	The Last Trail: This is the last of a trilogy published in1909 after "Betty Zane" (1903) and "Spirit of the Border" (1906). It's a historical novel set in the Ohio River Valley in the late18th century shortly after The American Revolution. It focuses on two bordermen assigned to protect the settlement at Fort Henry. Bordermen are self-appointed protectors of the region and both are very capable. They set out on the trail to determine who the renegades are that are stealing Fort Henry horses and kidnapping the women. Also, there appears to be a traitor at Fort Henry helping the renegades. The love interest of one of the bordermen causes him to question whether to continue his duties on the trail or devote his life completely to Helen. Zane Grey paints a beautiful picture of the region.
0	not a novel: Having read a few of his novels I was looking forward to another of his stories about different generations in Japan. Instead I found a detailed and tedious history of tea. I gave up after a couple of hours.
0	Ok: Didn't really interest me enough to read mire than first couple of pages. Probably wouldn't buy again. To others though this could be their book.
1	Real Samba: Contrary to the review by "Music Fan" of North America, this IS real samba, authentic as the life of Brazilian black people and habitants of the favelas of Rio de Janeiro. Moreira and Sargento are two of the greatest masters of samba. They are not professional singers, but influential composers and artists. If you want to get experienced in this kind of art, don't hesitate to buy it. If you want an easier introduction, try the David Byrne compilation. It's the "best" through his eyes, or ears, but Brazilian music is much more than that.
1	Price Hard To Beat: I have the 2 LP's bought in the last1970's and have the 2seperate CD's from several years ago. You're definately going to find(dollar amount) worth of rock music and rock ballads here. Hard rockers Witch Wolf, Young Man, Winner Take All, Rock & Roll Feeling, Havin A Ball and Man of Miracles are the best of JY's songs. Reminds me why I wished he would've contributed more to Brave New World. Dennis is great on The Grove of Eglantine, teaming up with JY on 22 Years, A Song For Suzanne, Lies and Christopher Mr Christopher. Former guitarist John Curlewski screams out The Serpent Is Rising with ferocity. The band's patented backing vocals are in full force here. If you're a Styx fan and have gone as far back as Crystal Ball and Equinox, you might as well go all out and get this double set as well as Styx I and II. They're well worth it.
0	McLaughlin leaves us waiting: I have been an avid follower of John Mclauglin's method of crafting an art called fusion. Though the Mahavishnu days are over and John's prior attempts at smooth jazz have been successful, this release is sour and dull. Though John does execute his technical prowess (ie. "chops") as always and the band plays beautifully, the tone of his guitar ensures a lackluster mood when listening. The album is somber. I don't think the pick-up, tone, distortion, or chorus settings on his guitar were changed throughout the entire album. blah-blah-boring-blah.
1	This Novel Is What Great Writing Is All About!!: I recently finished reading this novel and fell in love with the characters, the story itself and the message of both good and evil, as well as the concept of "Timshel" or "Thou Mayest".John Steinbeck is without a doubt a superb storyteller. "East of Eden" has many facets and dimensions within it. Somehow or another Steinbeck is able to write a multi-dimensional story with phenomenal characters and keep the entire novel cohesive from start to finish.I had a difficult to wanting to do anything but read this novel once I started reading it. The writing is fantastic and entertaining... The characters are fabulous and there was always so much going on in this novel that you eagerly want to find out what is going to happen next!This is a must read novel. Steinbeck is such a wonderful writer that I can see why he won the Nobel Prize for Literature!
1	One of the 5 Greatest Novels Ever Written: Perhaps every great novelist has one truly great novel. "The Grapes of Wrath" is outstanding, but "East of Eden" is Steinbeck's best novel and one (1) of the five (5) greatest novels ever written (in my opinion).Not only does Steinbeck make Genesis Chapter 4 the centerpiece of this novel, he literally wagers the success of this novel on one (1) Hebrew word found in Genesis Chapter 4: "Timshel" ("thou mayest"). Steinbeck wins the wager. Actually, he breaks the casinos-all of them-at Vegas by basing his novel around "Timshel."This book is a stunning work of achievement. If you enjoy fiction, you should love "East of Eden."
1	A "boring masterpiece": There were times, in the middle of the book, when I was so bored by the writing style and I wanted to stop reading it. But I was patient and it paid off. At times I wanted to give the novel two stars, then three stars, then four stars, and it probably deserves a full mark. But I'm keeping it at four stars to tell some readers, especially those who haven't read classics before, that it's not an easy read.I've read "The Da Vinci Code" and "Angels and Demons" by Dan Brown before reading this. They were entertaining throughout, but you forget them the moment you finish them. East of Eden, although boring at times, had an impact on me and changed the way I look at life. It just gives you wisdom and a new perspective. And that's what makes a book a great book. I may revisit this epic again.
1	Steinbeck goodness: This is the best book I've read so far. Steinbeck is amazing at drawing you into the story. I recommend this book to everyone.
0	Plastic!: It is almost impossible to determine if these wall supplies and holders are solid or plastic. Even the spec sheets don't always tell you. So I will let you know that if you are looking for solid brass don't buy this item as it is plastic and weighs almost nothing. I can't imagine this holding up to constant use by putting a heavy shower head in and out of it. And it is very expensive for a piece of plastic. I will keep looking.
1	I work here. Trust me. It's the best thing ever written.: I am a writer for the new National Lampoon that is launching in late September. There are only 3 of us here now, but believe me, sometimes it is hard writing under the shadow of the genius that created the yearbook parody. It is THE National Lampoon issue to own. You'll never laugh harder.
1	Please Reprint!: Will the world listen to the plea of thousands and reprint this masterpiece of 60's parody!!! I cannot face the future without seeing Ms. Armbruster one more time! Also, I need to see the Dacron, Ohio newspaper parody too! Please, dear lord, to see the joy in my teenage children's eyes as they read these wonders for the first time would hearten my soul forever!!!
1	Go PATS!: Bought this for wife as a stocking stuffer. I'm sure she'll enjoy backing her team without taking up the whole window.
1	Classic: John Carpenter's Halloween tells the story of an escaped mental patient Michael Myers(Nick Castle)Michael was locked up for15 years after he killed his sister.Dr.Loomis(Donald Pleasence) is on a frantic search for michael, Loomis knows Michael will return home to kill.Laurie Strode(Jamie Lee Curtis) a shy teenager is being stalked unknowingly by Michael.As the night goes on Michael kills her friends till it comes down to Laurie and Michael.The Screenplay was done by John Carpenter and Debra Hill.Great script one of the best of the genre.And John Carpenter directing was top notch. He creates the perfect mood and will make you feel trapped just like the characters.Donald Pleasence and Jamie Lee were awesome in their roles.And the score by John Carpenter was very chillingThe Halloween DVD is loaded with must see extras
0	Nowadays, this is pure B-comedy!: The first one in the series of (so far?) seven Halloween movies probably was a superbly scary thriller-horror movie in1978 - but for today's public, it rather appears as a comedy.There is barely any blood in it, and Michael Myers is easy to knock down (even though he doesn't die, of course...) by a young Jamie Lee Curtis who, by the way, look like herself, she only had longer hair and a smaller behind back then.The real surprise in fact comes in the beginning of the movie where we see who Michael Myers really is!
1	The best! I had to watch the last of it with the lights on!!: This is my favorite movie of all time. It all begins when Lori (CURTIS) is babysitting 2 kids when psycho serial killer Michael Myers murders her friends and comes after her. I loved the ending and the rest of it. About half way through the movie, I got so terrorfied that I had to turn on the lights! This movie is so horrorfying, that it still grips you with fear long after the movie is over!
0	They Cropped out the Boobs: The movie speaks for itself. However, they cropped out Linda's boobs when she's laying in bed. That's one of my favorite parts!!!!(no pun intended) You see them 20 seconds later when she gets strangled on the phone so WTF!
1	Absolutely Scary!: This would have to be one of the alltime scary movies.The roleof Michael Meyers steals the film. Meyers escapes from an insane asylum and returns home. His doctor played by Donald Pleasancegoes hunting for the evil Michael Myers. The villain of this movie starts killing the members of two groups of teenagers whoare celebrating Halloween.He is scary. After several killings by Meyers the movie comes to a conclusion. The doctor finally locates Meyers and shoots him several times blowing him off the balcony. The movie has a creepy ending with the supposedly killedMichael Myers nowhere to be found.The music at the end of the movie is absolutely creepy. Jamie Lee Curtis in the role of thebabysitter does an exceptional role. This is a must see movie. Buy it.
1	Best Slasher Film Ever!!: When a little six year old boy named Micheal Myers stabs his sister in cold blood to death, then you got one Hell of a problem. John Carpenters Halloween set the standards for every slasher movie to date, John Carpenter is a genuis, Next to Remero and his Dead films. Im not to crazy about the sequels to this film, but Halloween will always be a great movie. Micheal Myers Stabs His sister to death and is sent away to a Maximum Security Hospital for life, But escapes in a stolen station wagon, driven by Dr. Sam Loomis (Donald Pleasence), Who's Mission is to find Myers and put him away for good before lives are risked. Anyway, Micheal goes after his sister Lorrie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) Who changed her Last name because of her Psycho Brother, and some of her friends who get in the way, and its up to Dr. Loomis to stop him. John Carpenter even made up the creepy music score on a piano himself. This film is as good as it can get, it gets two thumbs up.
1	Best horror movie ive ever seen: If youre looking for a halloween movie to rent or buy then i definitely would go with halloween1. This is a great movie with plenty of violence and gore. It is interesting and exciting to watch. This movie should be every horror movie fan's favorite.
1	An absolute masterpiece of Terror!!!: This DVD, released last year, is an absolutely terrific representation of John Carpenter's vision of terror in a suburban setting. The picture is nice and crisp, thanks to THX, the sound and video system developed by Lucasfilm, a great restoration of this true classic of horror. In the film, Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) is terrorized by the man who later is found out to be her brother, Michael Myers, an unstoppable juggernaut of a masked killer. Myers is pursued by his Doctor, Sam Loomis (Donald Pleasance in a very memorable role), who seems to encounter hints of Myers' evil as he chases him down to attempt to apprehend or kill him. 30 years later, this film still does not disappoint to frighten everyone. But hey, as Sheriff Leigh Brackett points out, "Everyone's entitled to one good scare." Plus there is a terrific behind the scenes featurette, along with cast bio and behind-the-scenes photos. Get this one if you can. 5 stars!!!
0	Oh, please!!: I know Halloween is a classic, but it would be nice if it was a good classic. This is the second worst movie I've ever seen(the worst is Friday The13th). I like to watch horror movies but watching this is just a wast of time. Almost the whole movie is boring, it's not scary at all and it's just very poorly made. If you want something scary go buy The Amityville Horror, that movie is good. Halloween does not deserve to be a classic, so don't waste your time and money!
0	This sucks...: This is the worst movie of all time. I rented it once, and let me tell you, I almost tossed my PSP at the wall. It was just way to scary. It was scary+100. My sister almost peed her pants when she saw it. If you have any mind at all, don't buy(that is, of course, you're still wearing diapers).
1	Nice but not what i expected: i saw this movie recently in this updated format. its good but was not what i expected from a all time horror classic. I am not saying its bad but its not worth the publicity it gets .
1	The Classic Horror Movie: The story deals with a character named Michael Myers, who at the age of six stabbed his sister to death with a kitchen knife. After spending about a decade in a mental hospital he escapes and goes on a murderous rampage in his hometown Haddonfield. Halloween is loaded with thrills and chills that would keep about every horror buff entertained. Scripted and Directed by John Carpenter.
1	The Begining of the best Horror Series Ever!: Halloween is an instant classic. Jamie Lee Curtis and Donald Pleansance did the best acting. This movie is very mysterious, because you don't know why Micheal is going after Laurie. This isn't my favorite, though. Here's my best to worst: H4, H5(it was great), H1, H6(the t-cut! haven't seen p-cut) H2, H20, H8( wasn't bad.),H3 (it sucked).
1	A Must Have For Every Horror Buff: Halloween is a original and scary horror movie that deals with a disturbed male named Michael Myers that goes on a infamous mass murdering rampage in his hometown Haddonfield.
0	Poor DVD transfer: The transfer to DVD is very poor (worse I have seen yet). There are so many artifacts in the video as well as black portions of the letter box that is can be quite distracting. The movie is a great movie but save the dough and by it on VHS or see in when it is on cable.
0	"Kane Hodder should have played Michael...": Well, I liked the music in it, it was really good, but, sadly, it lacks a lot of Michael Myers. What I mean is, it doesn't show his face/mask a lot. Plus, Michael Myers is just plain looking, Jason and Freddy are more dead and scarier than this. But, the score was great, and the whole concept was good. Another thing, the body count was too low! Jason usually takes out10 to 20 people in every one of his movies. And plus, Michael Myers should have been played by Kane Hodder, than he would have been a lot creepier than whoever plays Myers now. Jamie Lee Curtis was an extremely bad actor, and her voice was just too manly! So, I'd really only recommend this because you need to watch it to understand the whole concept and because it has an excellent score, but if you understand the whole thing already (I mean, before seeing any of the movies) than do not watch this.
0	Utterly Ridiculous: Anyone who thinks this is a "definitive" version or a "director's cut" is sadly misinformed. For the record, Carpenter filmed these 'extra' scenes for tv as the censors had cut so much material from the theatrical release that it wouldn't fill the necessary time-slot. That's why the 'new' scenes are not widescreen. Furthermore, and more importantly, Carpenter has said that he HATES these scenes. Just his to his own words on the Criterion LaserDisc commentary. That this version is marketed and hyped is pathetic.
1	Halloween Blu-Ray: I am grading this solely on the blu-ray quality since everyone and their dog has seen this movie and probably come to the conclusion that this is a horror classic if not the best horror movie of all time.The quality of of this blu-ray is great. They did a great job cleaning this up for blu-ray material. This blu-ray paired with my LG7600 Clearmotion technology made this movie look like it was filmed yesterday. This movie was not filmed in the best of conditions and the equipment and film was not very good, but you would never know it when you watch this on blu-ray. I was really impressed.Now I am 30 so I wasn't alive when this movie came out, but I do appreciate the greatness of the movie. If I had to pick my top two horror flicks I would pick Exorcist and Halloween (in no certain order). They just don't make movies like they use to. My generation just can't figure it out. I highly recommend this for any HD enthusiast, and especially Halloween fans.
0	Where's the ending?: There is no real ending in this book. After the reading the last chapter the book leaves you asking yourself, then what? The characters are interesting and Nancy is surely a woman to stay away from and not unlike some women I have known in my lifetime. Your led to believe in the book that the climatic scene will have something to do with the theft of a large amount of money that they have been talking about for half of the book, but it ends with indecision about the heist and it leaves the reader clueless about several points.
1	Grandmothers life: I liked the book because it gave me an idea what my grandmother's life might have been like. She came west in1903 with her parents to homestead in Washington.
1	Look at life from one womens perspective.: Great look back to life at a slower pace when our country was younger. One womens recanting her life after a move to Wyoming to settle our land.
1	Letter from a Woman Homesteader: This was not my favorite book. I thought it was to simplistic. I received the book in a timely fashion and would consider buying from this seller again, however I did not care for the book.
0	lois: I read it for a book club. It was a Kindle free book. It was over priced. It was a waste of time.
1	Water wings: They fit my18 month old son great. The Velcro is kind of a pointless feature. The strap that is suppose to stick didn't even really reach when the floats are fully inflated.I have a problem with the valves not sealing and letting air out quicker than I can plug them up. I reported the problem to the company, and they sent a replacement pair immediately. Unfortunately, I had the same problem with the second pair. I think it may just be the way they're made.
1	Great price, great taste: This ingredient is used in cooking in Australia and probably other parts of Asia, but not easily found in the U.S. Or at least not where I live. It adds a great taste to the sweets that I have made and it's probably used in Asian cooking as well. I read that you can make it yourself out of unsweetened coconut, but this was just easier.
1	Very interesting: The book that I read was So. B. It by Sarah Weeks. This book is realistic fiction because it could really happen to someone.So. B. It is about a girl named Heidi. Her mom has something wrong with her, and can not speak. Her next door neighbor, Bernie, lives with her. When Heidi was looking through her kitchen drawers, she found an old disposable camera. When she got the film developed there was a picture of her mom and grandma that she did not know about. But in the background she saw a sign and it said Hilltop Home. After that she found out more than she knew. I enjoyed this book because it was very adventurous. If people enjoy sad and adventurous stories than this is the book for you. I also liked this book because it said that you can do `' anything you want without anyone stopping you.'' I think this book is best suited for sixth graders and12 and13 year olds.
1	Excellent: I saw this movie back in the 80's when we first got our cable television. I've always wanted to see it again and am also a big Albert Finney fan. It was exactly as I wanted it, bringing up nostalga. It is not a four star (11/2) movie for many more than myself. I was excited to have found it and now own it. Thanks.
1	Forgotten movie: I have been looking for this movie for years. I remember it from when I was just a kid. It was nice to have finally gotten my hands on it and been able to see it again. The movie was ahead of its time. The basic idea is a company starts using digital representations of real life models and no longer needs the real person anymore. This movie came out in the1980's, so imagine that! The movie has more suspense too as the models are being killed.
1	A Good Story: My only regret with this book is that I think I read it out of order. I believe that Trinity was the first of a two part story. But even by itself it stands as a really compelling story. I wasn't prepared for the places it would take me. It was surprising but nice to be transported to New Zealand. And the story of a very bloody battle (Gallipoli) which I had no previous idea of. I first thought that Leon Uris would only be an author of middle east books (having read Exodous and The Haj). But it was a pleasant surprise to find he is a master story teller.
0	Redemption: As other readers have noted, this book is not nearly the book Trinity is. Wish I hadn't read it, the first was so good.I guess that's the trouble with sequels.
1	This is a gripping epic that leaves one filled with emotion: This is one of the best books I have ever read, and it lead me to read "Trinity" the book before it. Mr. Uris truly endows the characters with realistic personalities and puts them in situations so gripping that one can feel as though they are actually there. I enjoyed this book immensely and I hope you will give it a try. -Chris Muller
1	Superb collection of short stories about southern life.: After reading this book about family values and interpersonal relationships among a rural southern family I wanted to cry. Ms Hatchett has put into words the feelings and experiences of those people who have grown-up and become parents in the south. Her collection of short stories encompasses all aspects of family life. There is illness, birth, death, and sibling rivalry. The author lives in rural Georgia and was obviously very observant and sensitive during her formative years. Her description of her family is painted with love and emotion and in such detail that the reader feels that they know every intimate detail of her family life. This book IS the life of a southern lady. All southeners and those who want to share the southern experience must read this book.
1	Nice Fit: I bought this clutch hose for my old 95 Ford Probe. It fits perfectly and working great. This part is rare to find and I have tried different local auto part dealers but no luck. I then tried Amazon and found it. Great price!
0	A Student Perspective: As a student, I have found this book to be a very difficult read. The chapters were filled with impossible to understand details. Perhaps for a practitioner the book is useful, but as an introductory textbook in a university course, it proved to be a very thick volume with litte useful information.
1	Good Read: This is a good view of the triumpial entry and Christs lasts days on earth from the perspective of the high priests right hand man/jewish slave. He is asked to be apart of Christs arrest and is the man whose ear is cut off and healed. He of course is transformed into a follower and we see his journey and what's required of him from then on.We did his in book club, and most of the ladies loved this book.
1	Doesn't get any better!: I had never read historical fiction until this, and what I read was absolutely unforgettable! Through the eyes of Malchus, a servant of Caiaphas, and a skeptic, he finds out for himself who Jesus truly is. This book will make you think. What are you willing to stand up for? At what cost? Awesome! Beautiful picture of what Christianity is and should be all about!
1	They are amazing: I can honestly say that I have never had the experience of the other reviewer, and I have used over a dozen of these candles.I love them as I currently have 3 dogs, 2 cats and 3 rabbits in the house; you can imagine how much that would smell if I didn't do anything to help. My vet office is who recommended that I try them. These candles not just cover the odor, the get rid of it and then leave a refreshing smell- I have even moved one to a bathroom during a stinky guest's visit with great results. I have usually used the orange or strawberry, but plan on buying the vanilla today.
0	Don't bother: Interestingly enough, this product was offered on the HP site when I ordered my new DV9000 laptop. As previous reviews have stated, it is indeed made of low grade plastic. I find it puzzling that HP would recommend this item, considering the fans line up in no way whatsoever with the laptop's cooling fans. The USB cord is too long and comes with an ON/OFF slide switch (which failed quickly). I cut the switch and wired it directly; it worked OK for a while. Now the USB plug on the chill pad itself has to be in just the right position to power the fans. A waste of money; don't bother.
0	Short Lifespan: This cooling fan worked for about 6 months before the USB power cable frayed and it developed cracks in the plastic. I wouldn't recommend it if you're going to be messing with the cord much.
0	Poorly crafted, no noticeable affects.: My laptop has no difference in temperature than sitting on hardwood. So it's job of cooling my laptop left a lot to be desired, but hey, it angled it nicely for typing. About a month after I bought it though, one of the rubber pads that elevates your computer slid off, it was merely glued. I can't imagine what I could have done to prevent this, as it never left my desk... so I'm going to attribute this to poor craftsmanship.All in all I love Targus products but this felt like trash, you get what you pay for definitely is true here.
0	it broke: I started using this product in the beginning of July and less than two months later it broke. I treated it very carefully and held it properly and followed all the directions. While I was using it it did the job but not for long.
0	Complete piece of garbage: Purchased this item, power cord started bugging out within a month. Had to forcefully tape the cord into the back of the unit after it crapped out to even get it to perform marginally.Huge waste of money.
1	Works like a charm...: This Chill Pad works great. Keeps my P4 notebook nice and cool. My notebook fan, which used to run constantly, is now silent. Fans on cooler so quiet, I often forget to turn it off when I close up my notebook. Excellent item, especially for the price. Would definitely recommend.
1	Targus Chill Pad: Other than the powercord on my previous chill pad coming undone due to wear and tear, I've had no other issues with the item.
0	Stopped working after only 2 months of having it: I bought this product on August 6 2007 and today Oct16 2007 it stopped working. I have a Compaq Presario laptop and when I first purchased this item it worked great and then this morning I turned on the laptop and the Chill Pad did not turn on the fans all of sudden stopped working.
0	Don't buy Targus products!!!: I have owned 2 Targus chill mats and they were the worst pieces of crap I ever bought. They last about 2 months before they stop working. Either they will just completely stop working or the fan blades will start tearing off, and then stop working. After about a week they start making a loud sound like something is caught in the fan blades. Unfortunately, they were the only brand available in my local stores, so I had to settle. I will never trust Targus for any product ever again!!! Sure, they offer a warranty, but to be honest, I'm not going to keep my receipt and warranty information in order to get them to replace the junk they sold to me with another piece of junk that will stop working in the same amount of time and charge me over half of what I paid for the product for shipping.
0	Wobbly: Bought one of these a few years ago and really like it. Needed a second one, but when it arrived I discovered a manufacturing error - the rear bottom pads were the same ones as on the front; they are supposed to be thicker than the front ones, so as to slightly elevate the rear so it doesn't wobble on the center screw. You can even see it in the photos on amazon.com So with the same pads front and rear, the pad is worthless as it doesn't sit level, it sits on the center screw and wobbles!Tried getting the correct pads directly from Targus, they said to return it to the vendor. Amazon was nice enough to quickly send a replacement -- with the same problem.Two tries is enough for me, off to Best Buy instead...
0	bad connection soon after purchase: The design for this is terrible. The end of the USB cord going to the pad sticks out at least an inch, so it's really easy to bump it if you use your laptop on your lap. A few bumps and the connection inside the pad becomes faulty. If you try to keep using the pad, you have to move the cord around to find "sweet spots" so that the pad gets its power. This is very annoying, and there doesn't seem to be any simple way to fix it.
0	Didn't know it was so noisy.: It does a good job cooling down the laptop but I use it sparingly because it's so noisy. I don't know what its dB rating is but it's certainly not like a typical PC fan. It's like five times louder than a typical PC fan. If there's a different chill pad that's quieter, I'd get one.
1	Cool Air From the Chill Pad: I've got two dual core laptops at home that I remotely run virtual images on and they tend to get rather hot with the lids closed. Putting a Chill Pad under each laptop keeps both of them much cooler. I don't hear the internal fan in the laptops firing up anywhere near as much. I did have to turn the Chill Pad sideways for one of the laptops to align the fan vents with the laptop heat vents but it works fine in that configuration. If I pick the laptop up and put it back on the Chill Pad the fan inside may start to spin off balance. You have to turn it off and then spin it back up. Overall a great deal for heat venting needs.
0	Horrible!: I orderd this chill pad in May. Didn't actually open and use it until the end of August. it has abruptly stopped working as of last night! Piece of garbage..........
1	useful product: Pros:-raises laptop screen to a more comfortable level-angle of keyboard make typing easier-keeps computer off of wood desk, no more marks on wood-provides for good ventilationCons:-requires attention to placing laptop correctly so it's not wobbly (only an issue if, like me, you are taking your laptop off the stand every day)
0	worked for a week: it worked ok for about a week maybe two then became unreliable. I have yet to find a chill pad that works well. I would not recommend spending your money on this one unless you consider your money extremely disposable
0	bad connection: I own two of these laptop coolers. Bought at the same time and used with two different laptops. Both have the same problem. After about one month of use, the socket on the cooling pad works loose, so the device no longer receives power and the fans stop working. The fans do an excellent job of cooling both laptop and lap until the hardware fails.If I could figure out how to crack the case, I might try to repair these devices. Instead, I'm shopping for another brand with better construction.
0	OKay but not long lasting and loud: I purchased this from Staples a few months back. It worked okay, but one of the fans constantly stopped working or made a horrible sound. It just stoppd working tonight.
0	Power Cord issues after a few months: This fan was easy to setup and use. It did a great job cooling off my Thinkpad T60p. But, after only a few months of fairly normal usage (no drops/excessive wear/etc) the power cord connection went bad - I even tried taping it into place to hold it in better, but it didn't work for long.Also, the plastic fins on the fan can get bent - not sure how, but they do. And then they catch, making that fan not work (there are 2). I've gone in and fixed it - mostly by removing the bent fin.
0	WORST COOLING PRODUCTS EVER!!: I bought this item originally from Wal-Mart. This is my FOURTH one in a little over a year. Every one I have had has died within 4 months. So I just kept either exchanging it for a new one, or buy a new one and return the broken one. Then it looked like Targus redesigned the PA248U because even though the model number was the same, they changed the casing completely and added an on/off button. I decided to give them the benefit of the doubt, so I got it. It was improved. Now it doesn't die outright. The fans will just stall out until you move the mat around and angle it up until the fans will restart. And to get warranty service, you have to pay to ship it back to them. But it costs over half as much to do that as it does to buy a brand new unit.
0	actual product model delivered is not of the pictured shown on amazon: I received a targus chill pad that was different from the one being shown by the seller. seller needs to update the image. chill mate cools the laptop but it is noisy. the fan noise can become annoying over time. I would not recommend this model.
0	The USB cable is a piece of crap: The pad cools better than nothing, but the chord that connects to your laptop is terrible. I've gone through at least 4 of them over the last year. Consistently the part of the cable that connects from the cool pad to the on/off switch has a break in it. All I do is wrap up the cable, put it in my bag, and otherwise use the device on my lap. I'm not sure how to limit its exposure much more. Only good thing is Targus will replace the cable for you, but it takes a few weeks to receive.Also, the rubber nubs that hold the laptop in place are often lost with no replacements readily available. I'm looking for a better product at this time...
0	Cheap quality: Mine did help keep my Dell Inspiron 8500 from getting too hot, but the USB cable leaves a lot to be desired. About a month after getting mine, the fans stopped working. I found the problem to be in the silly on/off switch they stuck in the middle of the cable. I removed the switch and spliced the cable. However, now, approximately six months after I bought the unit, it appears that a wire has broken near the USB plug, and as far as I know, replacement USB plugs aren't available. I guess now it's buy a 5V AC adaptor and wire into the thing. Needless to say, I'm not impressed.
0	better than nothing@: This device is an addition to the fan inside the notebook. However, by itself[;'vfv]\ it did little to cool the laptop down.
0	POS - and that does not mean point of sale!!: This product if ordered should just go straight to trash can. Fans are in the center, which does absolutely nothing for my computer. Second, the fans are small, so no air is circulated by these things. Worst fan I have ever purchased....Finally purchased a large single fan that works and works well. Stay Away from this Piece of $***. You figure it out.
0	Decent while it lasts: The pad ran quietly, but 2 years later it is missing 5 of the foot pads and the fans no longer run. For something with hardly anything to it, that's sad.
0	Great for first 3 months....then quit working.: This was a great cooler out of the box, it is silent and cooled nicely. However, it's cheaply made. The power cords are very cheap, and the cooler itself is flemsy plastic. The pictures make it look much more substantial than it actually is. Our quit working after about 3 months. Targus makes a "new & improved" version. We tried it as well. Much better made, but it was noisey (so noisey it gave me a headache). So we opted for another brand and much happier.
0	Plastic and cheap: I received a different chill pad than the one pictured. It is a very undurable plastic, and one of the fans is already making noise after 3 weeks. It does not cool well on a flat surface such as a desk, so the only useful purpose is if you have it on your lap. You get what you pay for I suppose, but I would not suggest it if you have te extra $20.
0	Didnt get the one in the main picture!!!!: Like the previous reviewer I too did not get the one that is in the main picture. I should have got one that has curves/contours on the sides but this one i got is perfectly rectangle. Plus get this the packaging that came with the one they sent doesnt even look like the one they sent. The packaging and instructions looks like the one in the main picture here. Plus the one I should have got has vents on the side. The one i got does not. So beware when u order this. U wont get the item that is in the main picture. Seems like a much inferior replacement they sent instead. Not happy!
0	Not what it seems: This product is not as show or described. It looks like a replacement for the Targus Chill Pad that goes into a lap-stand. The model shown is a great Chill Pad that has high speed fans and fits into the Targus stands. However this model is super thin is low speed fans. There is also no room to vent the heat out the sides or top or allow cool air to be blown by the fans. The fans also began to freeze up after a week of use. I ordered two and regret it. Don't let the fake picture fool you, this is a low model of Chill Pad and is poorly designed. There are much better models out there, such as the actual one pictured.
1	good book: Good information in the book, but the more I read online the more I question if flipping is right for me
0	Disappointing device: I've been using the BT250 for a couple of weeks now. Here's what I've found:1. The belt clip stinks. The device drops off it all the time. It's silly to see a $90 device sabotaged by a15 cent piece of plastic. (It looks stupid, also.)2. The standby time is nowhere near the 240 hours Jabra advertises. I find that it gives me a low power indication after about 24 hours.3. The 250 is awkward to put on your ear, which is a real pain when you're trying to take a call.4. I've found no way to voice dial on my Blackberry 7290 with the 250.5. The distance you can be from your phone is more like10 feet, as opposed to the 30 that Jabra advertises.6. The volume is very loud on the Jabra. I have to turn down the phone or reduce the volume using the buttons on the 250 all the time.I'd recommend the Motorola HS810 which has a good carrying case, voice dials on the 7290 with no problems, goes on more easily, and has more intelligently designed buttons.
0	FreeSpeak 250 - Not That Great: I was really looking forward to the Bluetooth Wireless experience; however, the Jabra FreeSpeak BT250 is not all that great. With regular usage for three months with my Sony Ericsson T637, I found: a very short battery life, mediocre reception, and a shorter roaming range from my phone {suppose to be able to move 30 feet away from your phone, I couldn't get it to work beyond 7 feet}. Additionally, people would often tell me that they heard excessive static in the background and that it was hard to hear me.This technology could be great, but its a little overrated right now with the cell phone accessories that are currently available. I have had good luck with previous Jabra products and this one, the FreeSpeak, is just disappointing. Maybe I will try this again in a few years. For now, it's back to the "wired" headset.
1	best purchase: I purchased this camera just before a trip to New Zealand. I had two requirements wide angle and macro. This camera more than delivers. It was very easy to learn. The battery life was good I used a battery a day. I purchased a back up battery. I took over 2000 pictures. Thus the back up charged battery. The camera took awesome photos the zoom was a major bonus that I was not really after. Overall I highly recommend this camera and Amazon has the best price going. There are some bad pictures posted on here that I feel do not represent this camera. A camera is as good as the person pushing the button. I have never taken a class and I find this camera user friendly. You judge I have posted pics.
1	Very good camera.: I have used this camera for two vacations and many back yard pictures and am quite impressed with it's capabilities! It was a little hard to get used to because it has more complicated settings than our previous Kodak digital camera, but I do love the10-power zoom and high quality images! The10-power zoom is especially helpful in capturing wildlife shots that will amaze your friends!
0	Panasonic Lumix: While the LCD image is clear and sharp in good light, it is distored in low light and at distances. What good is an ultrazoom lens if you can't see what you are shooting?
0	Lacks quality great concept!: Im a photographer. I compared this head to head with My Canon S70. The S70 quality of pictures far exceeded this camera. After working with other photographers and Panasonic I have determined It can NOT take a very high quality picture even in perfect situations. It only takes pix with 72 DPI vs180 DPI with my Canon. The highest MB image it will take is 3.51. My canon will take averate 2.5 to 3.5 and will do 4.5-5.5 often. WHY is this important. Well if you blow this picture up to say 5x7 or larter you will notice SIGNIFICANT grain and distortion. It was sad. I took pix in all lights and even focused on ASA100 and used a tripod. Im sending it back, Its not worth keeping for anyone who wants to blow up or appreciate a good picture. Panasonic even stated its a beginners camera. So my 5 year old technology in my Canon 7m camera Blows this Brand new camera out of the water.
0	After1 month pump does not work.: The pump does not work after1 month of intermitent use. The gasket in the bottom was installed wrong and water got up into the motor. The motor is now locked up. Pump area is fine, but shaft will not turn without a socket and ratchet. Usually get 2 years out of a pump.
1	This is a wonderful book: When I opened the package I was surprised that this book was so big. I was expecting something a lot smaller. Then when I started reading I was surprised that it held my attention as long as it did. Some of the items take up a page or two, and some only take up a paragraph or two. They say my mind jumps around a lot and that is what this book does, it jumps around a lot and for me it is interesting reading and it holds my attention when few books are able to do that. At the price these books are selling for used right now you can't go wrong on this one.
1	Very, very impressed: I listend to this Paganini rapsody many years ago and was totally overwhelmed. After that I bought ,seperatly, and listend the rest of them. I must say that their interpretation are excellent and very deep, especially the neat structure construted here are very, very impressed. Many other versions perform Rachmanninof with too much feeling, but here it is just enough. Highly recommended.
1	Golly.: Showy and theatrical makes women swoon and men's chests swell lush breathless passionate no-holds-barred romance more powerful than any film soundtrack. Above the keyboard, bangs flopping sweat spraying and whiplash over the keys. Plato's Idea of Piano.
0	Perfect in the beginning, Nightmare in the end.: I was a big fan of this scanner until recently.Opticbook scans books fast without damaging spines.I used it very carefully.I used another scanner of mine for non-book materials, because I didn't want to waste the lamp life.The result? The lamp died after around 200 scans!I used it intermittently, so I was out of warranty when the lamp died.I've used scanners of several manufacturers, and this is the first time that a scanner lamp died on me.In sum, $300 for 200 scans is not recommendable at all.Added: I got another reason to hate this scanner. Service of the company is horrible. I sent several emails about my problem, but never got answers.
1	power washer: For the home owner it does what ever you need at1750 psi. My last one was gas @ 2500psi. This electric washer is a no brainer. Easy operation and at1750 psi can still do damage to wood if not carful.
0	Really inappropriate: I don't like this film and because of it, it gave me a different perspective of the original as an immature movie.It's great for adults but anyone under17 don't watch it i guarntee you thatI am13 years old, so pretty please with a cherry on top, recommend my review PLEEEEEEEEEEASE or else!
0	Sex and nudity in the city of gambling: This movie is about a woman who goes to Las Vegas to try gambling but instead becomes a prostitute.If the nudity could be removed I believe this could be an exciting thriller about gambling. Instead it is really just like a silly soap opera with lots of nudity.Because of the large amount of nudity in this film I wouldn't recommend it for children or women.
1	Elizabeth Berkley is a babe!: Having been a fan of Elizabeth Berkley long before this movie was made,was thrilled to learn she got the lead. I really dig watching Liz in this movie, she is beautiful as always and does not let anyone push her around. Just watching her hitchhike at the end and beginning of the movie is enough to make any man smile, I just wish I could have been the driver picking her up! Great movie, here's to hoping Elizabeth will star in the much needed sequel Showgirls 2. Recently I saw her starring in the movie Student Seduction, Elizabeth Berkley is easily one of the most beautiful and talented actresses today, she is in the same league as beauties like Angelina Jolie, Julia Roberts, Ashley Judd, and Hilary Swank.
1	A big slice of cheesecake: Elizabeth Berkley stars as a hooker who wants to be a Las Vegas showgirl...only to find out it's not as glamourous as she anticipated. All I can say is, they certainly saved money on the wardrobe....Elizabeth Berkley spends over 50% of the movie naked.
1	hey hey hey what is going on here?: first of all laugh all you want but i actually thought that this movie wasn't all that bad.i do think that gina gershon played her part really well.i also think she could have played elizabeth berkley's role too.i thought the movie was way better than striptease.i've seen both the r-rated and nc-17 versions and i saw no difference.i also didn't see much reason to rate it nc-17 either.the funny thing was i was sitting there thinking to myself,you know mr.belding and screach got to work with liz all through her teen years and they probally saw this movie.hell they probally own it!!!!-jason zabka
1	Highly Underrated, The Plan 9 From Outer Space Of Our Time: Showgirls, by Paul Verhoeven, is definatly the sleaziest movie ever made. But is is also really underrated. Showgirls is basicly a American Dream movie, about a girl who goes to a town to make it big. Showgirls is filled of nudity, but not very much hardcore sex. If you wanna see a so bad it is good movie, see this one.
0	TRASHY: Over hyped! Not even good photography. Would not recommend it. Don't waste your money. Try to find some other film.
0	This is by Thrustmaster!?: Totally disappointing. The dead space is unbelievably large and the 8-directional button keeps misinterpreting input strokes. Can't believe this junk has the Thrustmaster name on it. The wheel is cheap plastic construction and has a very flimsy feeling. Don't waste your time and money on this one.
0	Arcade OK, but simply not up to standards for simulations!: Here we go!! just got myself a XBox, F1 2002, and this steering wheel...My conclusion is simple and dreadfull... it's just doesn't give me accurate control over my car!! The deadspot in the center is just to big, and the forcefeedback get's a 2 out of10. The experience with my PC and wheel is better!! and thats not the reason for me to run to the shop...But ok, as an objective reviewer i can give it 2 stars as it is useable in arcade like games.
1	Good But with a few flaws: This wheel is really good. The only major flaws are that when you change racing games you may need to change the sensitivity of the wheel. I was really looking foward to having a realistic gear shifter but it only shifts up and down which makes it good for the games like cell damage but not so realistic for games like project gotham racing. The foot pedals are great and i recomend you get this game wheel.
1	A Tragic story: As one of the characters in the book, I am grateful to Andrew Schneider and David McCumber for portraying what has happened to Libby, Montana and its residents so thoughtfully and thoroughly.The book is a "must read" for everyone.The story is far from over in Libby and around the country, but if what has occured in Libby serves as a lesson to other communities, it will be worth it.People can make a difference, if they don't give up and are surrounded by people that believe in them.
1	A True Account of Lethal Deception for Profit: The author Andrew Schneider tells the story of uncovering a scandal of major proportions. It is a frightening, chilling story of hidden dangers allowed by government officials whose jobs are to keep us safe. It is the story of a mineral still used in our country whose lethal dangers were recorded by Pliny the Elder. Asbestos cannot be safely used in any manner.
1	Pioneer Families of eastern and southeatern Kentucky: My wife thought this book was a great book of info to help with her research. Wll look to purchase more books on the subject.
1	Unparalled story craftmanship: I have just finished this book. It was a delight. Uncle Remus is one of the most alive characters ever to be portrayed in literature. Now, this is coming from someone who has read Conrad, Doctorow, Carrol, D.H. Lawrence, Robertson Davies, and many other engaging storytellers. Somehow, Uncle Remus resonated with me across the120+ years since it was written. The simple concept of a free slave mentoring a plantation owner's boy by masterful storytelling is pure magic and often heart-warming. For anyone young at heart, this book is a must.
0	Low Quality Filter: The white filter has an inferior quality to the one that came originally with the machine. It broke totally when I tried to wash it first time. That did not happen to the original one even when I washed again and again. I wonder if the replacement is fake.
0	Beware-- shipping ruins these planters.: I bought these planters because I had owned them before and they were very durable and attractive. I especially liked the high-gloss look. Unfortunately, when I received my planters, they had been put in the shipping box with the wadded up, rough craft paper that Amazon so often uses and it ruined the high-gloss finish of the outer planter. The other planters were nested inside and were fine. So when I ordered them in another size, I ordered one extra figuring that they would be packaged the same way despite the fact that I notified Amazon of the problem. Sure enough, same problem, but I was able to return the ruined outer one that I didn't want anyway-- it essentially served as packing.
0	Okay: "Class of Nuke 'em High Part 2" was an okay film, but not a great one. The original was better. When I ordered this, I thought 'Alright, I finally get to see Tromie, the Nuclear Squirrel.' I thought he'd show up at the end, but the makers of this film had to ruin it by showing the end of the film at the beginning. That's why I didn't much care for this one. Also, I didn't like the theme song. All they said was "Class of Nuke 'em High Part 2" over and over again. But I'm glad I only had to pay 5.99 for this movie and not13.99.
0	Easily the worst movie ever!: Blasting in my right eardrum, right now, is the Class of Nuke'em High, Part 2: Subhumanoid Meltdown theme song. Yes it has a theme song, and it does have the title in the lyrics. The hero of this film, apparently, is a hot hunk of man-flesh named Roger, who is smitten with a sub-humanoid, but is unable to get sex because he has B.O. The antagonists are mouths in peoples stomachs. Roger is really hot, and so are most of the bodies, but the mechanical mouths are too sickening to make this film even worthwhile as a bad nudie-flick. The plot makes sense, I mean, why not?
1	Daughter's now part of the airsoft games: My daughter wanted to join the buys playing "bad guys" and this was a good fit. We haven't used any caps but the gun is good quality for the price
1	Neanderthal Man: I gave one to my14 yr. old grandson who has AD/HD. He loves to take things apart and usually keeps me on edge when he comes for a visit. However, this toy kept him and a friend busy and interested for a couple of hours digging out the bones. They had a great time and did well in finding all the bones and putting them together. It was somewhat messy, but easy to clean up afterward.
0	Item is Not as Described!: I ordered two of these pans. One for myself and one for my sister. We DID NOT RECEIVE A STAINLESS PAN! We received an aluminum pan with a non-stick black coating on the interior. The pans we received were from the MC2 collection. Amazon sent me a new pan but I received another MC2 pan. So now I have to return two pans and my sister must return one. We are both collecting the 3-ply All-Clad stainless cookware. I am very dissapointed. Amazon will not honor a comparable sale price on a stainless pan.
0	One of my least favorite Nora books......: Cassidy St. John is out of work and is thrilled by artist Colin Sullivan's offer to pay her for modeling for a portrait. He treats her terribly throughout the whole book and then wants to marry her in the end, because he is haunted by her face. I doubt anyone would fall for such an abusive, domineering man in real life.Excerpt from the back of the book:"Fired from yet another job, Cassidy St. John hardly expected the solution to her difficulties to come looming out of the fog on Fisherman's Wharf. However, the darkly handsome Colin Sullivan seemed the answer to any maiden's prayers.When Colin offered Cassidy a job modeling for one of his paintings, it seemed her troubles were over- but one look at his blue eyes and Cassidy knew they were just beginning. How could she hide from the pitiless honesty of Colin's artistic vision when with every stroke of his brush he exposed her love for him?"
0	Old and Tired: This short story isn't worth the paper it's printed on. I only happended to buy it because of the Golden Gate Bridge on the cover. The book was very weak in plot development, character depth, scene descriptions, etc. Cassidy and Colin - the two romantic leads - could have been developed much more if the book was longer and the writing stronger. I think the publishers are just cashing in on something Roberts penned in high school - the writing is pretty bad. Save yourself the time and money and buy a more recent Roberts book.
0	Dorf: I did not review "Dorf Goes Fishing" however I did See the Complete Dorf Set. I did not find it funny. Even as much as I enjoy the comedy of Tim Conway. Probably would not recommend this title.
0	Not Socrates Cafe.: The Socrates Cafe is a poorly written book. Christopher Phillips was to busy using fancy words to realize that the reader has to spend15 seconds on words just to pronounce them correctly. I like his ideas but he came up short putting them into words! Using fancy language is not always a good thing. The best writing is writing that is clear and precise.
0	Do Not Buy: I wasted money on four packs, every burn has failed. I used about ten before my burner went dead and stoped reading dvds all together, so I had to buy a new burner and they still don't work. You get what you pay for.
0	Waste of money: This makes for a good late night HBO movie when you are bored. Not worth the money spent to own , nor the time spent watching it. IF it was 20 years ago I might have said it was a good movie , but nowadays its just too boring and obvious.
0	A ridiculous waste of paper!: I was grievously disappointed with A MAIDEN'S GRAVE, especially after reading THE BONE COLLECTOR. Certain weak premises are unforgiveable - such as frequent the use of the word "stoat" by numerous characters, including the deaf ones and their interpreters, when a sign-language interpretation of that word would be automatically translated to "weasel". This is Kansas, not England! All the characters are poorly-defined and broadly unsympathetic, except the smallest children who are barely more than props shaken at the reader like helpless puppies. The "suspense" in this book left me feeling dirty and voyeuristic.
1	Even an avid suspense fan won't foresee the surprise ending!: When a busload of deaf girls are kidnapped and forced into an old building by murderous convicts within the first pages of this novel, I felt as if this book was doomed to go downhill. The police have surrounded the building, there is little or no chance for escape,and how can the police hope to coordinate a succesful rescue when they cannot communicate with the hostages?Jeffrey Deaver manages to take what seems like a dead end, and turn it into an entertaining roller coaster ride. We watch as the hostage negotiator dances verbally with the head of the convicts to keep him from killing the hostages and as the eldest hostage uses subtle sign language to calm the others.But just as the seige seems to comes to an end, we learn that surrender isn't always a permanent thing.
0	What is on the tape?: It is hard to know if you want to buy an item when the descriptioin does not include what movies are on the tape?Could someone post that info?I'll rate it higher when I know what it is?Phillip
0	Disappointed: I was really disappointed with the product. It is to thin and the chain turns a dark color after a few wears. I have only had this item for 3 weeks and have had to clean it four (4) times already. Would not recommend it for purchase.
0	Kind of junky: Not really worth $250... "leaves" are just cut from flat sheet-metal, not all the candles are exactly vertical, and the chandelier i received was missing a hook for one of the crystals.
0	Bailamos all the way.: Only the song "Bailamos" can stand the test of time. If you are non-latino (like me), you can safely switch off the CD after the first song. I am thankful to the manufacturers that the best song is the first one. I don't even have to forward the CD beyond the first one to listen to the rest of the songs. It might be attributed to my little knowledge of lingua-latino, but I am not sure. I bought this CD when the latino fever was at a feverish pitch. Ricky Martin, I forgive. Enrique, your album is all greek and latin to me.
1	MARIETH DAVILA.: ENRIQUE TE FELICITO LA CANCION ES MUY BUENA,TIENE BUEN RITMO Y TU VOZ EN INGLES SE OYE MUY BIEN,ME FACINA TODA TU MUSICA, ERES EL MEJOR.
1	Bailamos: Me gusta mucho: Great music! Does anyone have any idea how I can obtain the lyrics to all the songs on Bailamos?
1	Great: I love this song but I would really like to get ahold of the words, can someone send me the words to the songs?
0	The names of this book's reviewers seem fake ...: "Warren Buffet", "Mr. Benson", etc. Give me a break. This author has people going to individual blogs, especially those that are centrist or conservative in origin, and spamming their comments sections with pseudo-testimonials. Seems like a rather pathetic way to sell a Chicken Little, doom-and gloom, progressive, arab-apologist tome by a State Department flunky. As I can see, many would appear to be gobbling up the tripe!
1	A MUST READ FOR EVERY VOTER THIS FALL: CRIMES OF THE RIGHT is a suspenseful near-real thriller set in the world of domestic surveillance, international espionage, Washington , and California Politics. This well-researched thriller demonstrates the events of the past four years in a fictional set-up, to entertain, dazzle, engage, engross, and make you think. If you're tired of reading non-fictions, try this near-real-thriller fiction.
0	sadly, a shoddy work: Arthur Ashe made many fine contributions to America, but this isn't one of them. Not up to the standard set by the other books in the series.
1	NICE,AWSOME,COOL SHOTS.: THE HONG KONG PART WAS AN AWSOME,SUPER DUPER,COOL GODZILLA PART.GODZILA'S STOMACH WAS COOL.HE LOOKED AWSOME AND BETTER THAN EVER.THE BATTLE SCENES ARE AWSOME.THE DESTROYERS PART WITH THE POLICE BATTLE WAS AWSOME.EVEN SUPER X 3.THE PLACE THEY FIGHT AT IS COOL(THE AIRPORT).EVEN LITTLE GODZILLA,HE GREW BIGGER AND WAS COOL LIKE THE FATHER(GODZILLA).GODZILLA DOES DIE IN THE MOVIE BY A MELTDOWN DESEASE.THE END WAS COOL WHEN JUNIOR GETS BIG AND ROARS LIKE GODZILLA.THIS IS MY FAVORITE GODZILLA FILM.I THINK THIS ONE IS BETTER THAN GODZILLA 98.
1	Terrific, Magical, spellbounding,left me speachless: Tells more than enough about the old dragon ways and is the most dramatic and heart warming novel yet. The Great Aurora will rise again. (HOPEFULLY)
0	Many Miles Away..a tribute to The Police: Some things are better left untouched. And this is the case with this cd.Being a professional touring musician this reeks with stink. I can't believe someone would release this to the public. Not a single track on this cd is worth anything.Next time leave it alone...The Police are the masters and you people are still in kindergarten.
1	Tells you what it really means to let go!: This book tells you what it really means to let go and what happens if you truly let go. Many times we think we have let go of something in our heads but we are just in denial. Our heart has not really let go. This book has helped me overcome some of the most painful experiences in my life. If you want to really understand what letting go means, I'd also recommend "The Ever-transcending Spirit" by Toru Sato. After you read this book by Toru, you will feel very free and understand how life is actually quite simple and extremely beautiful.
0	Ok: Not what I expected it to be. More religious than I prefer and definately works with the AA platform which wasn't what I wanted.
1	Life doesn't always go as we want. This might help.: Life does not always go as we want... as we had hoped... dreamt... prayed.This book was written to help people coming out of relationships that were brought to an end... by choice... by accident... by illness... by betrayal by the other... by whatever reason.Regardless, at some certain point, reality has to be accepted, and you need to move on. You can only suffer for so long.This book is both a crutch and a companion. It can be a guide. It is certainly worth the read.
0	The worst proofed book in the universe: This book is by far the worst proofed book I've ever read in my life. I can't believe I'm writing this as a review, because I can normally overlook a few typos. However, the typos in this book make for an almost impossible read. I can't believe I paid money for it.
0	BORING: every teenage girl should watch this before her first datebefore going to makeout lane don't forget yor diaphramgirlfriend
1	Good educational supplement: My 3rd grade special needs child enjoys reading these stories and the reinforcement of the "dot pen" with its lights and noise is a lot of fun for him when he has to work on the reading comprehension questions. The downside is that the stories range from1st to high 5th level (guide marks each story). I would prefer to have a box of stories with less range (maybe just1-2nd then another box of just 3-4) but we're using these and will continue.
0	Cheaper Than It Looks - Cheaper Than It Costs: The product looks nicer online than it does in person. When I opened the box, the stand was intact, but10 of the12 magnets had popped off the back of the cannisters and I had to reglue them myself.There are12 spices included with labels, but it would have been nice if they provided more pre-printed labels for other spices, or at least blank labels you could fill in yourself. Overall I'm pretty disappointed.
0	magnetic spice rack: The idea was a good one but,....... the tins fall off the metal base not enough mag in the magnet and they have been rolling all over my kitchen and it's big and bulky and no place to put it, a little too big for my counters. No where to hang either.
1	My son loves this hat!: My son got it in his head that he had to have a "Coolie" Asian style hat to keep cool. He's11 years old, so kind of odd for his age. I convinced him to buy this Chillba hat instead of the traditional straw woven hat. I was afraid the straw would fall apart too soon for the asking prices. I figured if his interest passed then at least I could wear it for gardening! It is cooler than hats that rest directly on your head and works very well keeping the sun out of eyes and has a wide brim for shade. I felt it was worth the money since it is washable and a nice sturdy cloth material.
1	Beautiful and Practical: This is a beautiful, practical (or should I say, practical, beautiful) piece. It is called a "Casserole for Two" but that would be two that are very hungry. I use it mainly for soups. It goes from cooktop to tabletop perfectly. When I do use it in the oven for a casserole, the same is true. It is a beautiful serving dish. The pan cleans easily. I cook for two (sometimes three or four)and use the "Casserole for Two" frequently and love it. Jo
1	I'll Be Watching You: I loved this book...it kept you guessing right up to the end. Very fast paced and exciting. I have really enjoyed all of Andrea Kane's books. You get involved with the story and almost feel like you're there. I hope she keeps writing a lot more.
1	Absolutely essential to your collection!: I used to have this recording on vynal. I got rid of it when I converted to CD's only. Needless to say I did not hesitate to spend the $25.00 to have it again but on CD. VERY good listening. Some of my closest friends were skeptical, we're not big Boz Scaggs fans, however, once they heard it they quickly changed thier minds. This recording is not quite the same as a1980/90's Boz recording. It's heavier on the blues side with nice horns and guitar. A real must have.
1	Very good value and performance!: This center channel speaker has a very crafted high quality appearance. I took the grill off and was impressed by the speakers themselves. I never realized how important a center channel speaker really is. I invested most of my money in the front and surround. I hooked this speaker up and it really filled the void you feel when there is not much activity from the other speakers when you hear dialog from movies. I thought they had good high and mid range. The voices and other center channel output sounded rich and strong. The 61/2 inch woofers are better than I thought they would be based on some other reviews I read.
0	?????This Game is confusing and stupid?????: This game is confusing and stupid!! It is hard to find out what each butten means but please use your money wisely and dont get this game!!!!! Get Roller Coaster Tycoon or The Sims.
1	Great Game: This game is a great game! You learn about the economy as well as build what some people think is great. It is true that the tutorial does not finish but this still is a great game. I highly recommend this game
1	I would give it five, but...: I really like the availability of a calcium/magnesium supplement in powder form. And I am sure KAL does a fine job in quality testing. I give it four stars only because you must be very careful with the dosage. I used their recommendation for a few weeks and wound up missing several days of work with terrible diarhea. After taking several weeks away, I started again with half the dosage, and have had no problems.I recommend taking this conjunction with a good vitamin D3/K2 supplement.
0	Not worth my time: Despite its colorful vocabulary, The Blood Countess has no merit in terms of content. The author simply describes the perverted, without having a pertinent message. If you enjoy reading about disgusting fantasies, then, by all means, read this book. But, if you are seeking a book that is more historically focused, look elsewhere.
1	Great for different types of beds: I have a weird shaped bed that means I can't use most bed skirts so this was great. It wraps around my bed frame perfectly and looks very nice. The only problem is, that on my metal posts it keeps riding down/doesn't stay up. So you have to pull them up once you make the bed. But I am not sure if there is really anything that could be done about that with the type of bed I have so I am pretty happy with this product.
0	DUST RUFFLE: Nice material. Well made but way way too short unless your looking for a10 inch drop don't bother. Way way too short...also can't return because Brown's Linens enclosed a letter that said10% re-stocking fee, no shipping cost to be refunded and if item was sent with free shipping, the amount they paid to ship to me will be deducted. Not worth spending more money to send it back to them with all the deductions I would end up owing them even more money...Oh well, maybe someone else could use it, I'll put it in my garage sale item pile.
1	The dark side of the river is revealed.: Keepers was hard to put down. I read it in two days. It held my attention and I remained curious throughout the book as to where we were going. What did all these people have in common?The book was well written. The setting was perfect for the story. I have been to the bluffs, the mounds, the islands and caves of the river. The author did a nice job of taking me from nostalgia all the way to the occult. I loved the mystery and dark secrets of the river.Schulz has a bit of Stephen King lurking about. Are his "keepers" of the same breed as Kings "low men"?If you have been to the river read the book.
0	Needs better editing- mistakes found: The judges for our trivia contest used this book as the arbiter for disputed questions tonight, and the NYT Almanac was wrong or incomplete on two questions, verified by multiple sources. Number one, The place Lee surrendered to Grant was not a "Courthouse" in Appomatox, Va.... rather, It was a farm in the *town* of "Appomatox Courthouse", VA. A quick Google search will confirm this on dozens of sources.The question the Almanac was incomplete on, was about the Definition of "DVD". Properly and technically known as Digital Versatile Disk, the NYT Almanac only metion only a colloquial "Digital Video Disk", which is common, but not accurate. A DVD can contain video, but not all DVD's contain video.I wonder how many more mistakes there are in this book? Yeah, I'm a sore loser, but right is right and wrong is wrong. Maybe the Almanac makes up stuff too?

0	Kiss it Off: If you're a die hard Kiss fan, you probably already have all these songs, so don't bother with the CD. If you're not, don't bother with this CD. It's full of rather unimaginative, derivative 70's rock, absent the spectacle of their stage performances. If you like Kiss & don't have many of their CDs, then get this one ... it'll do until you can afford the others.Personally, I'd go for concert footage in surround sound, or even music videos. This CD experience was flat, a disappointment. Perhaps I've just grown up too much since the 70's and need to trip back to my youth. Even so, for this genre, I'd prefer Def Leppard--more verve, more creativity, more driving power. More interesting.But choose your own poison ... how you want to blow your hearing is none of my business. This CD just doesn't rate high enough for me to risk tinnitus for it!
0	POOR SOUND: I HAVE ALREADY SENT THE T.V. BACK TO TOSHIBA TO HAVE THE VOLUMN REPAIRED, THE T.V IS IN THE KITCHEN AND YOU CANNOT HEAR IT AT MAX. VOLUMN 5 FEET AWAY. AFTER BEING REPAIRED?????, ITS NO BETTER
0	Not all that great...: I finished this in one day. It is that easy a read. Its got a virtually non-existant plot. The characters are also rather flat and unrealistic. It does try to have some humour here and there, but that's about it. It's not worth the time spent reading it, unless you happen to be doing a book report on something sucky. After I read this, I doubt I'll go watch the movie, even though the movie has a great cast. Overall, a disappointment.
1	Gift of the Red Bird: Very inspirational. I was totally filled with the Holy Spirit. I think I would like to go on a retreat like that. We have so much to learn. Please try it.
1	Cristo Vive: ...Y viene por una iglesia sin mancha y sin arruga. Preparémonos mas y más, el que esté preparado, sirva aún más, y el que esté en el proceso, ¡Clame, clame, congemidos indecibles! ...para que Nuestro Señor Jesucristo fortalezca nuestros lomos y así continuar este camino de guerra yendo de victoria en victoria y de poder en poder, con Cristo: ¡Llegaremos...!
1	Right Place, Right Time: I came to this book from the perspective of someone getting its brand ready to take its first tentative steps overseas. Anholt has provided a vital resource for anyone wishing to do the same, especially in these times of overnight global dotcoms.Heartily recommended.
1	Another Great Novel by Peter David: Great story, Peter David has really created a great new series for star trek fans, although there seems to be a long wait between the novels. The charactors are great and a nice change from the tv series as David can do what he wants with them as they are his creation. He takes them to the stars and back and almost always weaves a great plot. love Calhoun and Shelby!! 5 Stars David
0	Disappointed: I just received these a few minutes ago and was very excited to try them. I tried to put them on 2 different pairs of my daughters shoes and they do not fit. My daughter is 5 and wears a size12-13 shoe. The package says 4+ but I think it should say 4 and under. Also one of them is flawed from being stretched over the insert that was in it. I guess I will see about returning.
0	Ruby Slippers Shoe Covers: I was very unhappy with my purchase! I wanted to give the reviews the benefit of the doubt; I should have went with the majority! My two granddaughters and I had a Oz paarty and the shoe covers were off within the first15 minutes! I agree with the shopper who said to save your money and invest in your little girl a nice pair of red shoes that she will get to wear for more than just a few minutes! Not worth the money! :(
0	Cute but Not durable: The shoe covers were different sizes and did not stay in place. The bows came off some shoes prior to the tots going on stage. As they began to dance the shoe cover came off. They are cute but good for dress up only.
0	Formulative: That's actually more of a 2.5 than a 2, but compared to XTC's later work, or even their next album, it's really mediocre. "Statue Of Liberty" and "Radios In Motion" are excellent songs, as are "Science Friction" and "She's So Square," both included as bonus tracks, but there isn't much else to grab hold on here. Most of it's just generic quirk-pop (especially Colin Moulding's songs) and there's an endless, almost melodiless cover of "All Along The Watchtower" included as well. I'm not gonna say "But it's better than 90% of recordings today! " like all other fans because it's not. But the band got better really, REALLY quickly after this one-- they just hadn't pulled themselves together yet.
1	human growth master mind group: This collection of works by the various authors offers the listener an opportunity to have an easily accessed master mind group in the field of human growth. The morning commute's blahs are a thing of the past when the driver plugs in a tape or cd and visits with the likes of Jack Canfield, Marianne Williams and the others. Each offers a conversational monologue which address basic human perceptions and attitudes. Whether at home or on the road, each tape is a treasure of information which offers the listener tools to reshape basic views of life. These tapes are well worth the value. They are like good traveling companions. You welcome their presence, and delight in their gifts. I strongly recommend it to anyone.
1	I just love it.: I just love this cd.I like every one of the songs but, "party with me tonight" is my favorite. If you like blues it's the one to buy.
1	sultry...blissful...awesome: I've been a long time fan of Mazzy Star, but this album surpasses what Hope Sandoval did with Mazzy. Has the same feel but more sublime and matured. Her vocal skills seem to be sharpened a bit also. Not that she gets operatic or anything, but reveals slight nuances of purring and tonal hooks. It took me a couple listens to get this perspective, but my ears finally came around. For any fan of Hope Sandovals previous efforts, you will not be disappointed at all. I can't wait for her next release!
0	Useless don't waste your money: No material of substance. Don't waste your time or money. Look somewhere else. "The Idea Hunter" by Andy Boynton is a better book.
0	O'really..: The contents' probably great, but what happened to the cover of the book? Did Young & Bernbach over-squeezed their "creativities" and left the cover of this book out cold? Wake up guys...bright yellow is a definite NO-NO for a book cover...leave the "neons" for Las Vegas...!!
0	VERY MISLEADING!!!!: I just ordered this item and no where does it state that the dvd is missing it specifically notes that it is a blu ray & dvd combo pack as well as on the front it has where it said "blu ray +dvd" the +dvd is taken out. It should just say Blu ray since i got this so my daughter is able to watch it in our car as well in the house...which now i cannot, the movie is great but the fact that the title is misleading and im not getting all thats in it is upsetting.
0	Some inappropriate moments for family viewing: There are a few inappropriate scenes in the film, for instance a very busty gnome girl calling out the rules of a race in a racy manner and wearing a blouse with a lot of cleavage. Other scenes with a male gnome in a very tiny spandex outfit that is meant to be funny but seemed a bit obnoxious in reality. We were a bit uncomfortable at times watching this with the kids. I don't recommend it for kids under13, and if you're much older than13 I have difficulty in seeing how you can like this film. My wife and I both couldn't wait for it to be over!
1	Adorable movie you'll be surprised how much you love!: I was pleasantly surprised watching this movie with my kids and husband. It was adorable! And it was updated, kid friendly, and used in-jokes to keep it Shakespearean! Not to mention that Patrick Stewart played a statue of William Shakespeare talking to Gnomeo (James McAvoy), when both played Professor X, one as the young version, one as the old...Plus, it as just feel goody, happy, and used mostly Elton John music for the musical numbers instead of made up sugary tunes, which just made it more funny. It was great! (And my kids loved it too, LOL.)
0	Horrible movie!: Did not follow the Romeo and Juliet story. Was a waste of my time! Don't waste your time with this movie!!!
1	Gnomep & Juliet was GREAT!!: The movies arrived promptly and was in great working condition!!! The movie was very funny and I cried at the end.
1	Volume 3: It's good to see the characters in a different setting. Rowan Atkisson plays a very different part in each of the four seasons. Great take on how to develop a series.
1	Brilliant Rowan Atkinson: I positively LOVE British comedy... Benny Hill, Fawlty Towers, `Allo `Allo, Mr. Bean, Monty Python, Mind Your Language etc. The best of these is Black Adder.Black Adder turns history upside down on its head. Forget whatever you learnt of the Tudors because you will have to re-learn it when you watch the "real history" of Black Adder.For those who are unfamiliar with this series, it may take you a while to understand the nuances and "read between the lines". But this ability to understand the humor will increase as you watch the series. A general underlying truth is that each episode gets funnier as you move forward in this series.Rowan Atkinson is positively brilliant! Honestly speaking, I think that his performance in this series is just head and shoulders above his comedy in Mr. Bean.
1	where did it go: i know this album had the bonus-cut "its a man's pride" or "man's pride" where can i find it? that song should be in his top five
0	Driller Killer: How horrible! I waited years to see this (it's only now allowed to be seen in Britain again) and was so dissapointed. Let's face it..Abel Ferrara movies are crap..he's probably the most over-rated independent director around and Bad Lieutenant his most over-rated movie. The only films of his worth seeing are Ms 45 and Dangerous Games (only because it's the only film ever that Madonna acts well in). Budget restrictions aside, this is still grimy, cheap exploitation (nothing wrong with that) that tries to pass itself off as 'art'. Watch it once but don't add to your collection.
0	Moto-X: Lets see I really dont like the game at all, it gets boring quick its just not one of THQs good games.The gameplay is ok but thats about it.
1	Great reference: I have a 30 year old version of this book that my mother used in college. If you want to know how to integrate any weird function, look in here. The best table of integrals i've ever seen, and lots of helpful formulas and references. A terrific reference. I have used this book for virtually all my classes as an Electrical Engineering major.
0	Huge pills impossible to swallow: I have never had trouble swallowing pills. I can even swallow 4 normal sized pills at a time. But I can't even swallow one of these pills they are so huge. They don't even fit in a pill cutter! It is incredibly painful when one gets stuck in my throat. My swallowing muscle contracts around it and it is awful. I even tried cutting one in half, but it is so fat that it still gets stuck. I tried coating one in butter, and that didn't work either. They are going in the trash.
0	I didn't receive the product ....: I bought the product but I didn't receive the product. The vendor service was bad.
0	William J. Hennessey's Modern Furnishings for the Home: Not a bad book and it might be just what you're looking for. 300 pages, all b&w, picture quality is only fair. I guess this book belongs in a quality library but I found it generally disappointing at the price.
1	Jimmie Johnson Cooler: This cooler goes everywhere with me. It has a great design with a front pocket. It is large enough to fit several smaller glad wear containers or 6 cans of soda.
0	Not the same color as on the detail page!: So disappointed and will be returning this. The color of the product on the detail page is an elegant dark-grey with a smattering of green, but the actual product itself is very green and drab looking. I've attached an actual photo. Is it sage? I suppose. Is it dark? No. Is it anything like the product photo? Not at all.
1	A Glowing reiview of a classic band.: This album typifies the sound of the late 70's post-punk scene in England. The sound is tight, fast, and very energetic. The first song (Meccanic Dancing) is driven by a angular guitar riff and classic hiccup style vocals by Partridge. Very fun indeed. Of course like most albums there are a few duds but still fun. My fave tracks are Jumping in Gomorrah (because it puts religous zealots in place), Red, and I am the Audience which is an electrifying New wave/punk stomper.As well listening to Go 2 you can hear where many current bands (Blur, Bis, and even Green Day) pick up their snotty yet propulsive sound. A great album which will keep you on your feet dancing or bopping.
0	The best worse zombie movie of recent memory..: Even the most desperate of zombie fans will find this absurd. I mean jeez, a young girl living in the woods with her zombie parents? No, this isn't a comedy. A journalist runs into a local man in a town that she seeks a story. He tells two bogus tales of terror. A man does exercise for15 minutes in the first story. BORING. The sound, editing, acting, and over all product is BAD. I am a big fan of gore and bloody zombie effects. This had nothing to offer me. I doubt you'll find anyhing for yourself either.
1	Useful: My wife and I are planning a trip to Tuscany in May 2007, and ordered this video to get ideas about off-the-beaten-track places to go. The video is beautifully shot, well-narrated and contains useful information. On the negative side, though, its a bit thin on detail and far too short in running time. It left us wanting more, but certainly excited about our upcoming trip. In that sense, I suppose it was worth the money.
1	Tripp Lite TMC: The item is well made. It has an easy to understand hook-up and operation. I would recommend it to friends.
0	Was sent a used item: The item I was sent arrived in an open box and appears to have been used previously. There are scratches along the sides, especially near the outlets.
0	Good-looking but poor performance: We bought the Crosley Songwriter in October of last year at Linens 'n Things.The remote didn't work, but Customer Service at Crosley sent a new one, which worked fine.As a fourth-grade teacher, I have many cassettes that I want to record onto CDs (stories from the reading series, old books-on-tape), so I used it to copy these over. All seven of the CDs I made worked wonderfully. Transferring albums was equally easy, although I only did one. In both cases, the most difficult part was being present to press the button that manually splits tracks.After a month of use, however, the CD player would only play part of a CD--three songs--and then it would quit, locking up the unit. Powering off and back on freed up the unit, but didn't solve the problem. We have since returned the Songwriter to Linens 'n Things for a full refund. This is a great idea in an attractive package that just doesn't work.
0	Great idea, poor performance: It worked great at first, then the turntable started playing slow. Same thing for the cassette player. It worked great the first time. Now it is all muffled, if it plays at all. Sometimes when you try to record the machine shuts off. I whole heartedly do NOT recommend this item.
0	Expensive Piece Of Junk!!: I was actually able to convert some vinyl to digital, but not to the quality that I expected from this Crosley 248. After a few weeks the CD changer refused to open. I can assure you that if you cannot open the CD changer, the machine is worthless. Don't waste your money! I would have given this ZERO stars, but had to settle for one star instead!
0	crosley crap: I was very disappointed with my purchase.the record player doesnt play very clear. and the tapes were clear,then the tape player wasnt eatting them. I would not recommend spending all that $$ for something i think is not that good.
0	Junk-Save Your Money: This player was a Christmas gift that was opened Christmas morning. The player had a bunch of screws or something rolling around inside the sealed player when we took it out of the box. There was a larger component rolling around inside the player also. Must have been where the screws came from. We still tried out the player hoping that we would not have an electrical blow-out when we plugged it in because of the components rolling around inside the player. It seemed to work ok. We returned it for a full refund.This item was very cheaply made and for the money they are asking for it it is not worth it. Do not go by the pictures because the one I received did not look like the same wood color. And thats because it is not real wood.I am not sure where this was made but it is typical of the junk that is being made in China these days. When I was a kid this kind of junk was being made in Japan.My advice...stay away.
0	Crosley recoreders are junk "DO NOT BUY THEM": I bought the Crosley recorder last year at Christmas and used it (3) times and the cassette player quit working...sent it back for a new one and then the power button would not work....just got a new one again for the third time and now this power button doesn't work you have to use the remote control only to use it....junk,junk,junk!!!!!!!! Never again will I purchase one of these and they should pull them all off the market since they are getting such bad reviews and everyone has problems with them......
0	CROSLEY CR248 SONGWRITER CD RECORDER: THIS MACHINE SEEMS TO WORK O.K. , BUT THE SUPPORT FROM THE MFG. STINKS. THEY CHARGE 9.95 FOR12 PLASTIC 45 INSERTS THAT YOU CAN PURCHASE 60 FOR $7.00 ON E-BAY. THEY OFFER A BRUSH AND REPLACEMENT NEEDLES FOR OTHER MACHINES, BUT NOT FOR THIS MODEL. THE SUPPORT IS VERY IMPORTANT WHEN YOU ARE PAYING SUCH A PRICE. SOMEONE NEEDS TO NOTIFY THEM OF THIS FACT.LEN SCHIFF
1	Very funny movie: This movie was great it was hysterically funny and is no more tasteless and vulgar than low brow movies that have come out since this, movies that make this movie look pretty tame! I don't like movies that I feel cross the line from funny low brow to being too offensive, and while there was one thing I didn't care for in the movie the majority of it was fine but I didn't feel this movie crossed the line and I just thought it was funny and one of the few low brow comedies that I actually don't mind owning on video.
0	What's the Big Deal?: With all the hype, I expected to be floored! It dragged -- the gags were infantile and not funny at all! I've got to say this was one of my great disappointments!
1	The funniest movie I have ever seen!: I am very skeptical of comedy. It takes a lot to make me laugh. The American mass-media concept of what is "funny" rarely, if ever, appeals to me. This movie was different. It was artistically, stylistically, intensely hillarious. Bravo to the director and the cast! Thank you for making me laugh out loud...it's been a long time.
1	Great for those who understand the comedy: I have read all of the other comments and laghed along with the great comments but was a little upset with the one raters. In this movie you have to understand the comedy.. not that you have to be a teen but the comedy is not for your average person. It's for the people that like outrageous unusual comedy like the scene with the dog or witht the hair gel. And the story is great too especially the end where all the guys who like her are in her house. It is SO FUNNY! If you know what comedy is.. you'll enjoy this!!!!
0	What an appalling movie !: I listened to the hype but borrowed the DVD before I bought it. I am so glad I did - one of the worst films I've seen in ages. The whole theme of guys trying to get their leg over is far better done in Notting Hill. There are about 2 funny moments in this film and even then I found myself embarrassed about laughing (well, sniggering) at them.
1	Loved it: I love the idea of a bunch of guys being in love with the same woman, and it coming down to the end where they all confront her. And the Brett Favre cameo was definitely unexpected. Truly a masterpiece of comedy.
0	Cat: If you can read and/or spell the word above, you're too smart for this movie. Boring, moronic, and (worst of all), not funny.
1	I have never laughed so hard at any movie.: If you haven't seen it, do it now. This is a must see for anyone who loves a good laugh at any cost. From the pizza delivery guy, to Matt Dillan's teeth. You can picture yourself in any situation that occurs in this movie. Watch it with someone you love. Anyone got any hair gel?
0	What a stupid movie!: This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Why did they have to make a movie about a geeky kid trying to get a guy hired to go look for his old girlfriend. I think that's a dumb idea. Cameron Diaz is pretty hot in this movie but the whole movie is just plain dumb. When I first saw this movie in the theater I thought it was allright but now that I watched it so many times on video it has gotten boring and stupid. If you want to see a movie that's more funnier go rent American Pie that movie's hilarious. Stay far away from this movie it's dumb!
0	Funny.: The performances were fine but the script was weak as the plot.The good things are the funny scenes that you watch in the trailers and no more the rest is a superficial and stupid story.But the funny are very great I really laugh.
0	There's something about Mary--Something foul about Mary!: This movie starts out with a lot of promise, with lots of laughs, but by the second half-hour, one is just clamoring for it to be over. It's an extremely uneven movie (although it must be noted that none of this is Cameron Diaz' fault, who does the best she can despite a poor script). The movie is a bore, and a waste of time. What a silly movie- just skip it!
0	What are they thinking??: I hate it when they don't create a Blu Ray with a proper master copy! Why the hell would they bother using a lower quality copy to create this??!?! It's just plain lazy. Don't bother buying, as it is obviously about the same picture quality as the DVD you already own!WAKE UP MOVIE STUDIOS!! IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE HIGH DEF, FROM THE ORIGINAL MASTER, WHY WOULD WE BOTHER BUYING IT IF THE PICTURE IS THE SAME AS DVD!!!
0	There's nothing about mary....: I only gave this movie1 star because you can't give negative stars. This movie is painfull to watch, stupid, corny, and just plain not funny. Most of the jokes have been done before in one for or another. The plot is thin with too many plot twists. The ending is totally predictable, and so is a lot of the plot (even the twists). In short, a movie to avoid.
1	Classic: Who doesn't love a classic? The only thing I missed were the pictures, but I read it to my girls Christmas eve and they loved it!
1	A classic tale with Amazingly beautiful artwork: My son constantly wants me to read this book to him. The illustrations are beautiful and the story is a classic. I'm sure this book will become a family heirloom.
1	night before chtistmas: great christmas book. just like the one i had as a child. my kids love it. given as shower gifts and new to be moms enjot the book
0	Text without pictures.: This edition includes just text, without pictures. Since I was buying this to read to my kids, I definitely wanted pictures, so I ended up buying another edition of the poem.
0	Poor quality: I was greatly disappointed with this item. Nearly every page was torn. Some drawn on & some had tape over the pictures. I bought this as a gift and I am hugely disappointed. The book couldn't even function.
0	Book's animotion is barely viewable.: The animotion is very dark and can barely be seen. It totally ruins the book. I will not be able to use it. It would have worked better to just had regular pictures.
0	Don't buy it for the pictures... there aren't any!: I was looking for this title to share with my first grade class, this is not the one, all words
1	Great book: My kids found this book very beautiful. The illustrations are amazing too. We definitely will read this book as often as we could!
0	Not great on Kindle: As far as the poem, it is exactly that. However there are many typos, including double capital letters at the beginning of nearly every sentence. The spacing between paragraphs is large and leaves one and a half paragraphs on every page. Looks like someone took a classic and tried to quickly format it for a kindle trying to make a quick buck for the holidays. Save your time and money, there are good copies to be had.
1	Must have for Colorado vacation!: I just returned from vacation in Winter Park, CO. This book was an invaluable resource. I knew exactly where to go, how to get there and what to expect. The guide is very accurate and easy to use. If only it could control the weather!
1	Awesome Book!: Great book! Well laid out and accurate...he has several others including another one for trails that are south of I-70...I have both!
0	Warning: does not cover Websphere 4.0!: I bought this book for the following reasons:* Seemed to cover J2EE including J2EE, including EJB development for WebSphere* Included a chapter on WSAD (Websphere Studio Application Developer)* High customer reviews* Low price (for used book)My biggest mistake was not to realize that the book was based on Websphere version 3.5 and the chapter on WSAD is based on version 3.5 as well, so this book was barely useful for me.It does have a good overview of J2EE, EJBs and Websphere, so I think that's what explains the high ratings: it is a good book if you're looking for introductory material on how to develop J2EE applications on Websphere, as long as you're developing on version 3.5. If you're using version 4.0 I recommend staying away from this book.
0	This is a remarketed title in wave of the recent "Eye" craze.: This is a remarketed title due to the recent craze of the movie, the Eye, thanks to the relentless bad American remakes of good Asian horror. This movie was originally called The Eye10. This movie came out quite a while ago and techniclaly it is the third installment of the "Eye" series. I am a huge fan of Asain horror, including The Eye and The Eye 2 (The originals of course). However, the Eye10 has had such terrible reviews I could not bring myself to spend any money on it. If it ever shows up on cable as a free movie, I would try to watch it just to see how bad it really is. I think it is crazy that this movie was retitled for Americans (even though it is not an American movie and has not been remade, make no mistake that this was renamed for the benefits of the Americans through Lionsgate to cash in on the recent aforementioned popularity). If you want a proper review of the Eye 3, google the Eye10 and read (and weep) all about it!
1	No whack trax on dis disc!: This album is live! A silly skit starts out the cd.It is based on the Coming to America movie! Then the music starts out with Rollout,the first single.Overall this cd has better beats and rhymes than Back for the first time.The lyrics are definetely more tongue in cheek.Other bumpin trax are Go 2 Sleep,Cry Babies and Saturday.One very touching song,Growing Pains is his best song yet.Hopefully it will become a single.It is that good.Check out this disc,I think it deserves a 4.5 out of five for more maturity and cleverness.
0	this guy's the worst.........: Can anyone get this bozo to shut up? He's so goddamn annoying, and he seems to be getting worse with every new album.Stop supporting this moron, people and listen to some real music for a change.
1	Masterpiece: This has got to be one of the best Southern rap CD's ever released! Luda has both great beats and lyrics which is a great follow up to "Back for the first time". My Favorite Tracks:1.Coming 2 America 2.Rollout 3.Move 4.Go 2 Sleep 5.She Said 6.Growing Pains. Great Album!
0	shipper sent me wrong cd then did not respond to emails: i waited three weeks for this cd then when i got it the cd inside the case was some bass test cd.
0	Very disappointing: This book spends too much time on all different types of drums rathar than concentrating on what I, and a majority of people who buy this book want it for: To play your standard rock band drum set. Also, if you don't have any music foundation, such as reading music, forgot this book. It spends a very short time teaching you how to read sheet music and if you don't understand it then the rest of the book is useless. I came close to throwing it in the garbage several times but keep coming back to it, figuring I'm missing something but I've yet to figure this poorly organized and written book out. Maybe this is the 'Dummies' style as I've never read one before. I found more helpful and free information on the net.
1	Cute: Will help complete our halloween decorations for next year. Have not used it yet, but they arrived in fine shape. WE currently have Snowmen on for Christmas and they have already had people ask about where we got them...
0	Rip-Off: This review is not a review of the book (which, I guess, serves it's purpose just fine), but a review of the price. $70 for a spiral-bound book!?!?!?! As if college isn't expensive enough already.
1	Yoga is such a wonderful tool for children: Yoga provides such a great tool for children to learn how to understand how their emotions and body interact. This is a great DVD for teaching your child how to relax, how to implement breathing practices into their every day activities and how to have fun while getting exercise.I would like to see more DVD's focused on families practicing yoga together. This would be a great tool for after school programs or creating play time for a few children to interact in a controlled environment.Need to make this an app for your phone!
1	AN ANGEL SENT DOWN FROM HEAVEN: I can't explain the timeless quality of this album...themagic created by songwriters David Holster and Suzanne Paris
1	Pretty Cool: Although this wasn't one of my favorite books in the story it was still informative. Rand goes is STILL in the Aiel Waste which is tiring, but his bond with Aviendha grows and becomes love. but this is the book that starts the series sex scenes too. yuck! and there is a forsaken fight! yes! I find the fights between Nyneave, Elayne, Birgette, and Valan Luca or whatever his name is quite humorous. And Nyneave's love craving for lan romantic. Though at the end the when Rand reaches Cairheien, he is suprised at the death of Moiraine and Asmodean. Fortunate for your guessing purposes, it leaves you stumped with 2 questions*Who killed Asmodean?*Is Moiraine really dead?But you will have to read the other books to get more clues!
1	Wheel of Time keeps on turning, and surprising: What a series! Started reading based on my son's recommendation. Interesting, once I got going, and it continues to take me places I never could have imagined. Never boring, some loose ends and leaps of logic, but it keeps you glued so that you continue reading the books. This book maintains a high level of imagination, surprises and plot twists. I love that the women characters act, think and react like real people. These women are inteligent, strong, courageous, and far from timid. So far I am impressed and genuinely enjoying reading this series of books.
1	A good book but Jordan is starting to slip.: I thought The Fires of Heaven was a good book. But Jordan is starting to slip. It seems that Jordan is repeating himself. But when I finished this book it seemed to me that the six book was going to be better.
1	TFOH-- two thumbs up: I really enjoyed this book-- book six hasn't gotten here yet and the wait is almost unbearable. I didn't give it five starts because Elayne began to really tick me off around page... two hundred? Some of it was predictable but overall I thought it was well done, and it's keeping me waiting for "Lord of Chaos". Well worth the read.
1	Great series: These books have well developed characters and plot lines that remind me a bit of the Game of Thrones series.
1	A step up from Shadow Rising: After a couple of chapters to set the stage, the Rand plotline moves forward at breakneck pace throughout this volume and a number of important events take place (including the biggest mystery of all in this series!). My only complaints were that the Siuan/Min/Leane and Elayne/Nynaeve threads moved too slowly at times. However, the Elayne/Nynaeve thread still had some critical events take place. I truly enjoyed the Rand/Aviendha interaction, as I did Mat resisting the call of battle at first before giving in. The last100-150 pages of this book are shattering, and really serve as the conclusion to the events from Shadow Rising. While it dips in parts, this is a solid four rated book and really makes you yearn for the next book.
1	Much improved: 'The Fires of Heaven' is much, much improved from #4 in the series. Jordan completely eliminates every one of his overused phrases from 'TSR'. No more people muttering under their breath or smiling amusedly at another's embarrassment. (Okay, so the women still like to try on different, outrageous clothes in Tel'aran'rhiod..and they're surprised by someone every time, but no one's perfect)Like all of Jordan's books, this one bogs down a little in the middle..but it's a much shorter period than normal. The action pretty much goes straight throughout. I was left at the end wanting more.
0	Dream is NOT a delirium: Hobson does not understand the topic he is studying. Dream is not at all a "delirium" but a very complex organisation of consciousness.
0	A different, lesser, Sayers: Thought I'd read all of Dorothy Sayers' mysteries years ago, but never got around to this one before; turns out I hadn't missed anything all that time. Not a Lord Peter Wimsey story, but does take place in the same universe -- there's a minor character who's also a minor character in the Lord Peter corpus, and I think there was a throwaway line in a Lord Peter story referring to this murder.It's a gimmick book: it's not presented as a traditional 3rd-person narrative but as a collection of personal letters, newspaper articles, memoranda, and sworn statements. The gimmick is cute, but not successful: too much of the book (especially in the second half) is carried by the sworn statements, which are sufficiently story-telling to make it mostly a1st-person story (albeit told from a couple different1st-person points of view). And as a mystery it's very lightweight, and too broadly given away.
0	terrible adaptation of.........: a very good book. Much like Bonfire of the Vanities, this was horribly miscast and butchered. How this ever fell into the hands of John Carpenter and Chevy Chase, I'll never understand. Someone else mentioned that Harrison Ford would have been better cast as the central character and I think that's pretty much dead on but the screenplay would have to have been trashed and put in the hands of someone who wanted to create something that actually represented the original and also in the hands of a more capable director. John Carpenter may be good at what he does but he was way out of his depth with this and was probably incapable of controlling Chase. Bottom line, the books very good if not great and the movie is a huge disappointment that really sucks. On the other hand, if you're a big Chase fan, go for it.
1	Ideas for Language Arts Instruction: Ideas and Insights: Language Arts in the Elementary School is an excellent book every educator teaching at the elementary level should own. This book focuses on the whole language approach to teaching elementary language arts. It connects classroom practices with the theory that undelies them.Moreover, what interested me the most is that it is teachers, who have studied children's literacy development who discuss the reasoning behind new teaching methods that are replacing workbook exercises in language arts and not people who have never been in a classroom setting.In Ideas and Insights, these teachers comment on activities, developed by practicing teachers, for reading, writing, speaking, and listening.
1	New insight: This book offers an interesting insight into the writer Vasily Grossman and contains a fine selection of some of his best writings during the war. A worthy publication that brings an important writer to life.
1	A real suprise find at my public library: Just an ordinary guy who likes to learn about the world by reading non-fiction from my public library. Takes a while to get used to the way the original notes of Grossman are interspersed within the editors explaination of the setting. Grossman truely was the Ernie Pyle of the Soviet Red Army. The editors give me the feeling that Stalin probably would have sent him to the gulags or worse after the war simply because he was "human" in his writing, if he had not been so popular as a correspondent for the official Red Army newspaper. If the USSR had broken up after Stalin died, maybe he could have compiled all his notes himself into a great read about the ordinary soldiers and all the generals, but the editor and translater did well putting his notes in order and tying them together to make sense of it for us. Now I'll have to see if any of Grossman's earlier novels are available in English.
0	The thing is huge. Too huge for a car. Put on your18 wheeler!: I guess it is my fault for not checking the size.It is too huge to put on the back of my jetta.Go Jets!
0	good for101 courses, not for real scholars: The encyclopedia is poorly organized, and too many outdated sources for many entries. Extremely bad for Art Historians! If you want a particular site, one must search for it under its location. Not theme or era. There even isn't an entry for the Romanesque era!! And there isn't any for San Isidoro de León - Panteon de los Reyes. While the writer of "Historia Silense" might have known King Ferdinand; the writer wasn't a monk at Sahagun!! He was either at Silos or at Leon. Once again Routledge has proven itself unable in doing a great encyclopedia of the era.
0	Gagged: I'd say it was a book purposely written stupidly to appear clever. I found it extremely dull. I gagged out1/2 way through it. I gurantee I can write better than this. If an unknown author had submitted this story to a publisher, it would have been returned with a rejection form letter.
1	My second favourite Vonnegut!: Although I have have only read three Vonnegut novels so far, this is my 2nd favourite out of all three. (Slaughterhouse-five being my favourite.) It's story tells of Dwayne Hoover, a car salesman who is slowly going insane, and of course Kilgore Trout, the science fiction writer whose on his way to Dwayne's home, Midland city, to an arts festival he's just been invited too. My favourite part is the ending. Now I won't spoil it for you, but when I finished the book I felt the ending to be quite dissapointing, but I thought about it for awhile and decided I loved afterwards. Vonnegut creates a beautiful portrait of insanity and humour in this brilliant piece of fiction!!!
1	Awesome. And so on.: I found this book thought provoking and hilarious. I really enjoy the writers easy style. The character development was excellent. All these parallel lives summing into one big crazy soup.
0	A Waste of Time: Breakfast of Champions is the first Kurt Vonnegut I've read. I hate to say it but I was not too impressed. I was hoping for a book that would be challenging. What I got was a book that used infantile humor in the guise of satire to try to impress the reader on just how clever the author is. If he has a main point, it seems to be that we are all empowered individuals and that all others are there to act as robots to interfere/interface with our lives. This viewpoint is just too cynical and cold for this reader. I very much doubt hat I will be reading any other of Vonnegut's works.
1	Vonnegut's funniest book: It would be hard to describe the plot of this book. I've read it more than 5 times and I cannot explain it. Something about a transvestite guy named Harry LeSabre who sells cars, but not Buicks. Kilgore Trout, Dwayne Hoover. They're all interconnected and in fact everything that Vonnegut writes about starting with Cat's Cradle emphasizes that some people are in the same "carass"(people whose lives are intertwined whether they know it or not) for their lifetimes. Maybe our lives are not as random as we thought. I laugh out loud whenever I read this book. I read it twice when I was pregnant and had a boy with a great sense of humor.
1	A Giddy, Existential Delight: "Breakfast of Champions" was Kurt Vonnegut's birthday present to himself as he reached the half-century mark. How gracious of him to share this purging with the reading public. Dark, disturbing, and hilarious, this novel stands among the finest of the previous century. Courage. Bravo, Mr. Vonnegut.
0	Mixing totally different languages and cultures: Baltic countries has distinct difference from Slavic cultures and languages, besides they are not in Eastern Europe as so many archaic minds including the compilers of this book consider.Even within the Baltics languages differ so why make such generalizations and throw all these languages in one pot.You will be surprised how similar Estonian is to Finnish as they're both Finno-Ugrian languages. Surely this book ignores the basic linguistic facts and doesn't facilitate the traveler's life.
0	I didn't like it.: I just didn't know what I was getting. I don't like this one. I didn't even watch all of them. The first one was so bad.
1	Best sub drama of all times: This movie is the best sub movie of all times. Sean Connery plays Captian marko Ramius who intends to defect. Alec Baldiwn plays CIA agent Jack Ryan who goes on the hunt for the Red October. Finnaly Scott Glenn gives an excellent secondry perfomence as Capt. Mancuso of the USS dallas. All in all this is a great movie for any one who likes sub movies.
1	Absolutely wonderful!: "The Hunt for Red October" is an absolutely great adaptation of one of the best novels ever written. The producer's of this movie took Tom Clancy's masterpiece and made one of the best military action movies ever. While they didn't stick to the novel perfectly, that's no big deal, it's still a great movie. Sean Connery, Alec Baldwin and the rest of the cast performed admirably. Although later films have Harrison Ford and now Ben Afleck in the role of Jack Ryan, to me, Alec Baldwin epitomized Jack Ryan. Sean Connery turned down the role of Sybok in Star Trek V to do this role, clearly a no brainer there. I would recommend this DVD to anybody. I would also recommend the book.
0	Do NOT buy from this seller!: I ordered a video tape from this seller about six weeks ago, and after about a month of waiting, I emailed the seller to inquire about my purchase...no reply, and STILL no product. Save yourself the time and money and DO NOT BUY ANYTHING FROM THIS SELLER!!
0	Terrible Picture Quality: This DVD is so low in picture quality it is not worth purchasing. It looks like a used VCR tape that has been watched many many times. Don't waste your money on this one.
0	Horrible Video Quality: I love the Hunt for Red October and the makers of the DVD did it a horrible injustice. The video quality is horrible. I tend to buy DVDs for the enhanced video quality, but save your money on this one. Just buy the VHS version and save your money because it is not worth it.
0	Film 5 stars, Bluray qualtiy1 star. Film's DVD is far better.: One of very few DVDs I *often* re-watch, and excited to purchase the Bluray version, I am terribly disappointed in the lack of image quality. The Bluray version on my very new contemporary Bluray player and year old HDTV, is extremely grainy to the point of distraction & disgust. I wasted my money and will go back to watching the DVD version.
1	Exciting!: An excellent portrayal of intelligence and cunning by Sean Connery. The movie is both exciting and thought provoking, very entertaining.
0	Do not buy this!: Great movie (as we all know) but the BluRay edition if horrible. We can barely make out the audio even with the TV turned up double the volume. Save your money!
1	The Hunt for Red October: Great movie, Sean Connery played his role outstandingly.The Hunt for Red October (Special Collector's Edition)
0	Not As Advertised: In building out a DC powered rack,we were looking specifically for a12VDC powered rack-mountable switch. The unit arrived as a 9V, with attached documentation "included power supply as required" in the specification. So we threw it out, and have ordered a different unit. For a home user, it would make no difference... but if a unit is advertised with power supply specs, then I expect to receive same.
0	Shallow and boring!: I ordered 5 books including this one, and all of them are so very shallow, low level and boring.Some of the chapters were actually copied in several books! Unbelivable.I would probably recommend this series to school children interested in management - nothing more than that.
0	Bridgmans Books: I bought 3 of Bridgmans books: Life Drawing, Constructive Anatomy and Heads, Features and Faces after reading the reviews. No one mentioned that most of the pages are dedicated to the anatomy of men, however I am interested in the female anatomy, so, these books did not work for me.
1	A Personal Note From the Author . . .: Nobody could have anticipated the recent events ever happening to our country. My heart and prayers go out to everyone involved including those watching from their homes that wish to help. I pray for you daily. I also urge you to help with your prayers and to find Jesus if you haven't already.In light of what has happened to our country recently, I cannot begin to stress the importance of the subject matter contained in my book and books like mine. If you are searching for answers about a God that loves you, cares unconditionally for you and judges you based on your actions while on this earth, then this is one of the books for you. Take an adventurous trip to heaven and feel what it might be like to fly with angels. While you're there, pray for your salvation and those around you. If you are inclined to do so, pick up the Bible. I will glady take a backseat to that book any day.God bless.
1	Geek Humour at it's best: Snaggy and Nitrozac show their teeth in this wonderful display of Geek Comedy. Whether you're a geek, or not, you can't help but laugh at the comic misfortunes of Windows users, Linux users and Mac users alike as they try to live in a world full of people who have normal sleep patterns, and have no idea what it's like to have a 3:00 AM call from your boss screaming at you begging to know why the third line of the second paragraph on page 5 of the online catalog isn't bold, or why the server is returning an error. Prepare to stretch your laughing muscles when you buy this book. A must have for all geeks. Makes a great gift, and will never let you down when you need a pick me up. Buy two, because surely you'll want to give on to someone you love.
1	Very good book I ever read: I found it very helpful to prevent medical errors occured in administration of medicine to patients. It should be read and considered thoroughly in order to give your patients a safer service.
0	Not her best work: I love Kristin Hannah,,,usually! This book was a bit boring and predictable. I would not recommend! But many of her other books are wonderful.
0	don't waste your $!: This is the worst product as far as cool mist humidifiers go. I just bought it today. I agree with the previous review...it's just a bucket of H2O with a *wick filter* & just a fan blowing cool air. I, too, thought it was missing a piece or I did something wrong. I just returned a Vicks one as it was too loud & there was no on/off switch, but it worked! I'm going to return this one first thing in the morning. Don't waste your money!
1	Monster Book: Book is amazing. It has full color pictures from the actual Monster Garage show plus other pictures. It goes into the peoples careers who are fabricating the parts. Overall good value for the price.
1	Space by Andrew Chaikin: This is a coffee table size book with many spectacular photos from space and from other aspects of the Space Program. Andrew Chaikin has don his usual marvelous job with this book. It is even more than I expected and it was received in new condition on a timely basis. I intend to get all of Andrew Chaikin's books.
0	Lacking high level details: This guide is missing some essential details that are needed for higher level characters. It only has maps of about 3 cities (it doesn't have maps for Rome, one of the largest, most populated city in the game) and it doesn't have maps of the higher level zones either.The list of nano programs that this guide has does not include details about the higher level programs.Overall, this guide would be strictly for a newbie, if you are passed level 20, this guide would be a waste of [money]
1	Elvid - That's the Way it Is: This DVD of Elvis's times in Vegas is unbelievable. I am in awe when I watch it. So much better than the VHS version obviously because of the picture and 5.1 sound. On my bigscreen and home theatre system, it's almost as if I am there in concert. This is a must have for any Elvis fan. What is good about this DVD is that it is all rehersal and concert. Gone is the fan and other footage from the original.
1	must have elvis edition: this is my second elvis cd/dvd collection and its worth every penny, very satisfied with the fidelity and video recording, very informative history included. good luck
1	That's The Way It Is: RCA/BMG, Warner and anyone that sells Elvis products, know that the "hardcore" fans will buy just about anything related to Elvis. As to this DVD set, could it have been better? Yes. But I don't really have any big problem with it.
0	LOOKS LIKE CHEAP BOOTLEG: SAVE YOUR MONEY, ORIGINAL VERSION,IN MONO,THE OUTTAKES VERY POOR PICTURE AND SOUND, THE SOUND AND FILM OF THE AFTER PARTY SEGMENT OF THE OUTTAKES ARE COMPLEAT IN THE ENDING CREDITS OF TTWII S.E.2001 RELEASE, YET WARNER CHOOSE TO CHOP UP THE SOUND UP HERE, WHAT A UNNESSARY RIP OFF.
0	I want my money back from Time Warner: I just can't help believing! (Actually, this is one of the songs that is not included on this DVD. Can you believe it?) I have no idea how to access to those "Bonus Selections" that are listed. I think there must be something wrong with the production line. Read the other reviews, they are all true: all the great songs you like from the original version are gone! To all disappointed fans, send a complaint to Turner Entertainment/Time Warner Home Video and ask them to get things right and replace the ones we have bought.
1	DVD Elvis Thats The Way It Is: I was very impressed by the quality of the recordings and the picture was so crystal clear that it was like he had been flimed yesturday....it has a great song list....BUT....I actually sent it back because the bonus15 tracks that where supposed to be extra footage where actually not included..and allot of the song that where in the supposed bonus footage are teh songs that I like most....it was a real shame that they missed out the bonus footage as it would of made an excellent addition to your collection...also one thing that really annoyed me was that It came in one of those cheap card board covers, instead of the standard plastic sleve covers, which is really annoying as it easly gets wrecked and torn...in conclusion I would probably wait till they re-release it with the bonus footage!!
1	Disappointing: The background music is not clear and the CD was a waste of money. One star is too high.
0	Pretentious and Too self-involved.: I am not quite sure if there is a plot in this novel. It is a preachy novel about pornography and journalism. Xan Meo is more like an idealogy than a three-dimensional character. There is a sense of superficial intelligensia. The novel meanders with Xan Meo's [complaining] practically about everything. Smoker the journalism is a much more interesting character, but then again, Amis has to inject his snobberish intellectulism -- philosophizing everything.What is this novel about? A waste of my [money].
0	3 Things about Yellow Dog:1. Yellow Dog is a chore to read - its self-conscious post-modernity, its intentional tangle of narratives and voices, and its glee in confusing the reader make it tiresome from the first sentence.2. You can call me old-fashioned, but I have a taste for finding humanity in at least one of the characters - in Amis' novel, there are about a dozen characters to keep track of and not a shred of heart among them.3. I took this book from the library and suffered through it for weeks, enslaved to my own principles of finishing a book you start. But I was absolutely grateful when the library recalled it at about page 200. It's not worth a 50-cent late fee.
0	Finish it, then forget it: This is a disappointing work when compared to Money and London Fields and even Amis's shorter works such as Night Train and Other People. The book is all over the place really, but tangled up in the mess are dazzling threads of Amis's sublime wordsmithery. The behaviour of the characters strains credibility to breaking point and by the time you get near the end, you just want them all to f*** off. But maybe that's the point...
1	Captain Jack's woman: This is the pivotal novel of Laurens' Cynster series & Bastion Club series. For those unfamiliar with Mz Laurens' writting, it is also a good intro to her writing style. Her character development is excellent & the interaction between the main characters is witty & playful. She gives both Kit's & Jack's reasoning & point of view so one can easily follow how each misinterprets the others actions & thoughts. This novel has humor & wonderful romance with plenty of action both in bed & with the "bad" guys. These characters will reappear in subsequentnovels, so remember them! I strongly recommend this novel.
0	weak effort: The book starts well, with a strong female character but when kit meets our hero she becomes irrational,irritating and weak time and time again. All it takes is a kiss and kit is unable to have a discussion about things that matter to her. Really, how sad is that she is so easily manipulated. I enjoy sex scenes but I'll confess that I skipped a lot of them out of irritation.
0	Poorly written and ill-organised: This could have been a very good book but the author seems to suffer from an inability to identify with an audience that doesn't already know the material.The material is all there and if you struggle through it you can find alot of useful insights...but more times than not the struggle isn't worth it. I can't suggest getting it unless you feel compelled to collect books on Apache or are in desperate need of more documentation.
0	Online docs will do...: I bought this book, but it turned out that I didn't really have to use much of it. The source program package from apache comes with a complete, up-to-date installation guide, online docs, pointers to FAQ and other info. If you are trying to set up Apache in the absense of any internet access (some kind of a boot-strapping process that someone might have to do in some special settings), this book might be useful. But that's usually not the case, and I wonder who would bother? For quick reference purposes, O'Reilley's Webmaster in a Nutshell would do a much better job for dollar.
0	Poorly organized and the butterthlies is a terrible choice.: This book is definitely a poor read. I got It because I thought the second edition would be a better read. These guys need to learn how to write and organize their thoughts better. There are other books that I'll buy over this one. The trick is to make it simple and have good flow; even the choice for the website (butter*) sucks. This review comes from a guy majoring in computer science.
0	Only a synopsis of info already out there: I could have written this book by struggling through with installing and understanding Apache myself. In fact, by installing Apache and looking through the documentation, I knew most of what was in the book already. There was no unique information here, or unique solutions to real-world problems. I think this book may save you time in an emergency or in general, but beyond that it's a bit dissappointing. I think the publisher said, "O'K', let's get two guys, have them install Apache, and write a book about it." That's just my opinion, though.
0	It's all uphill from here.: Usually purchasing an O'Reilly book on any topic is a virtual guarantee of excellence. This book is a notable exception. There are many other Apache books available, I can only encourage you to take a look at them. I have worked with Apache for several years, and this book fails me every time I turn to it for help. The on line documentation is excellent and is by far the better choice. This book skips over the essentials and the basics and wanders off to discuss odd topics that have never been of concern to me. Pretty much a waste of money and shelf space. Sometimes I do say good things, go read my review of Advanced Perl Programming by Sriram Srinivasan if you don't believe this.
0	I need something better: I did not like this book. I think you can do much better with another Apache book. The authors basically wrote a diary of setting up a webserver from start to finish. They seem board out of their mind and try to be funny ever once and a while. They copy the man pages word for word occasionally.I need something serious and authoritive where the authors are passionate about the subject like the authors in "Unix Power Tools" or "Unix System Administration Handbook"Come on O'Reilly, give us a better book on Apache and show us how to install PHP.
1	Somewhat helpful.: This was somewhat helpful in my study of vintage clothing. It is not as helpful for my needs as The Dictionary of Costume and Fashion.
0	Best of Bobby Rydell: After placing one order over a year earlier, giving up on delivery, then placing a second order and waiting over four months for delivery of this CD, it was a smashing disappointment! These are later recordings of Rydell's great hits, and pale imitations of the originals. What a waste of time and money!
0	rating Of1 Not For Bobby Rydell But For This CD.: This cd is a remake by Bobby of his songs,For years Cameo Parkway held the masters so artists like Bobby and Chubby Checker rerecorded there records how they did this leagally i do not know,but there is no reason to buy this collection when you can buy the Cameo Parkway Collection for a decent price and have all the original master recordings,and Chubbys is out there to.....Bobby is a class act though even to this day if you never knew this story,when Bobby was young his parents would take him to Wildwood,NJ. and he would be singing in the back seat.Bobbys father would ask him to please shut up and stop singing,and said your not a singer,but low and behold Bobby did become a singer and even sang about his Wildwood days.Wildwood NJ is certainly not the same town as the time Bobby sang about it but listening to this song you can relive those days just a little.
0	Rydell Remastered: This was the worst CD that I ever purchased. Remastered? It doesn't even sound like the same person. TOO much base. The original recordings from this era NEVER had that much base. Judging by this recording, I will never buy something that I know is remastered again. If the rating stars had a zero, that is what I would rate this CD. I think if Bobby didn't hear it, he should, I think he would be embarrassed.
0	No focus, every bit for every body: This book is for every body, I mean for nobody. Some stuff is so simple even for a beginner as me. Some, on the other hand, are so specialized that I skipped all together. Unless you are already very versed in Unix, you won't get too much out of it. ( Why do you need it if you are already versed anyway?)
0	My least favorite Swedish Beauty lotion: I've been using indoor tanning lotions, pretty consistently, for about10 years and Swedish Beauty has always been my very favorite brand. I've tried numerous lotions of theirs and Chocolate Indulgence is by far my least favorite. It's thicker than most and the smell is terrible! You definitely don't want to use this unless you can shower right away - in addition to smelling bad, the smell seems to get worse after tanning. I go to an awesome salon and with their beds normally see a difference in my tan the day of my tanning session - not with this lotion. The only use I can see for this product is maybe as a pre-tan moisturizer if your skin is very dry. I have had much better results tanning using lotions without bronzers from SB. My current favorites from SB are Priceless and Bronze Beauty - pretty much the same lotion but Priceless is from their blush line. Both of those work great!!
1	Great Book But Buy the Infinity Reprint Instead: "Saint Jack" is a great urban fantasy but the other published book is superior to this edition. The new edition has a larger type font and so is easier to read and contains great drawings which this edition doesn't have. So you should buy that instead of this. I happen to have both books being a big fan of this particular author.
1	What they promised is what I got: I've been very lucky with amazon since a lot of the times I end up receiving my products earlier than expected. This one I got it in time, not earlier but just in time so I can't complain. Very well paked, no damage, it was good/
0	1 marker, not12.: The description says you get12 pens, but you only get one. Yes [...] is a fair price to pay for1 pen, but if I had known it was only one I certainly would not have paid [...] for them to mail me one pen! Sounds a little too much like a scam to me. The seller was good enough to refund my money after I contacted them, so if you have bought this pen thinking you would get12, definately contact them and demand a refund. They certainly aren't in any hurry to correct the description as it has been over a month since I bought it and it still says12 pens.Regarding the pen itself, it is far from perfect. It will occasionally spurt out a large amount of paint onto your work with no warning, making a mess of everything, including your clothes. Other than that, the colors are good and when it doesn't squirt it works pretty good.
1	Good movie!: I thoroughly enjoyed watching this movie and am glad I decided to rent it. It's a classic and must see for anyone.
1	You never really know someone: This is one of the greatest depictions of a woman gone totally f_____g off the deep end I've ever seen. Which brings me to my point: some women you can get with, use each other and be done with it. And there are those whose diabolical intentions do not come to the fore until it is too late. Lucky for me, I got out of such a situation with minor scrapes a long time ago. This is a great film along the lines of the '78 documentary "Scared Straight". As far as the question of choosing between the lovely Anne Archer vs. the ugly Glenn Close...sometimes these things don't matter as much when enough erotic HEAT is being thrown your way. That explains that.
0	Ho-hum: This movie was okay. The first 30 minutes were kind of a drag. I'm not exactly sure why this film garnered as much attention as it did. I made note of the old style taxi cabs, the big shoulder pads on women's clothing, and the telephones with cords.Glenn Close was quite creepy and did a good job drawing the line between sanity and insanity. When she slit her wrists and wiped it on Michael Douglas - that should have been his cue to run away from her!! In the scene where they ate spaghetti, it made me want to eat spaghetti all of a sudden.Other than that, kind of boring, we all knew she was going to snap, it was alot of waiting to see it happen. Didn't really enjoy the film.
1	FATAL ATTRACTION INTRIGUE: JUST WANT TO SAY IT'S A MOVIE THAT KEEPS YOU ON THE EDGE OF YOUR SEAT NO MATTER HOW MANY TIMES YOU SEE IT. I SEE SOMETHING DIFFERENT EVERYTIME. I HAVE A QUESTION. WHAT IS THE LITTLE GIRLS NAME IN THE MOVIE? WAS IT ELLIE? WHAT'S HER REAL NAME? HAS SHE BEEN IN ANYMORE MOVIES? SHE WAS GREAT IN THE SHOW AND LOOKS LIKE A POSSIBLE ACTRESS TO REMEMBER. THANKS FOR ANY HELP OR ANSWERS.
1	Thrilling, Malevolent, and Brilliant: "Fatal Attraction" ventured where no other film seemed to dare risk-adultery. This was outrageously successful, and for good reason. Glen Close and the other major actors are magnificent, and the film is thrilling! Michael Douglas plays a man with a perfect wife and a kid, and he screws it up by commiting adultery. He thinks it's just a one-night stand, and that he can just blow off his alternative girlfriend. But, this girl he's had an affair with (Glen Close) doesn't like being ignored. She doesn't like being treated like a slut who can just be used. So, she begins to stalk Douglas, call his phone non-stop, destroy his car, and some very dispicible things which I will not divulge. Something I enjoyed about this film were some of the similiarites associated with the movie "Cape Fear". If you're like me, and you love those types of thrillers about pyschopaths, you should definitely watch this movie!
0	Average Re-Thread but good storyline: while the Song itself is pretty much a Knock Off of "The boy is Mine"&a few other things because I can pinpoint where Kayne West gets some of His Suff from,the storyline is interesting.Brandy Vocally though is not as Good as She was back in the day.Her Voice is missing a certain spark.She still has the Cross-Over vibe in Her Material that will always get Her some kind of a Hit but that doesn't mean you are gonna get solid results from Her vocal chops anymore.
1	by a reader/writer.: This author has the rare ability to get under the skin of wildly different characters to such an effect that the reader is not only entranced but emerges with a deeper understanding of these poor mortals, of which we are one. Beautifully written, powerfully effective.
1	Great Cat: The catalytic converter did not look new like the picture you see on amazon. It looked a little faded due to shelf life or something but, I did fit perfectly and my car is a lot more fuel efficient. No problems yet and I doubt that there will be because magnaflow is a great company with great products!
1	Great reading regarding Waterloo: This book is the intersection of the families represented in These Old Shades and Devil's Cub(Avon), and Regency Buck (Audley). Makes for a compelling read regarding Waterloo and an excellent period romance.
1	The best book on World Class Manufacturing: This is simply the best book I have ever seen on World Class Manufacturing. It explains the concepts in simple terms, using a short story that anybody can grasp. All the world class concepts are here: jit, error-proofing, rapid build, etc. The book also has a terrific glossary and explanation of world class manufacturing terms. Again,the best I have ever seen. And it has a great reading list for people who want to go into more detail with longer and more technically complex books.
0	Too little useful information: This book's strong point is that it covers a very large amount of information on java programming. This, however, is also it's weak point. It doesn't cover anything in any useful amount. I think if it covered half the subject matter, and went into depth on the subjects it did cover, this book would be a must have. I'd skip it unless you just wanted to see what java was capable of. It provides a good survey of java topics. I'd buy books on the subject you were interested in, and skip this one. I returned mine.
1	mormonism for dummies: I was very well satisfied with the book. It explains mormonism in words that are very easy to undersstand and it explains our beliefs accurately. It is very well written and complete.
0	Worst Possible Book on Mormonism: This author purports to be a Mormon, but writes without any authority on the faith. Her writings elsewhere have been gross misrepresentations of the faith. She has no authority from the Church to speak for them, either. If you genuinely want to understand Mormonism, there are good books available. This is NOT one of them!
1	Hmmm...: I was so glad to see that this cd had all new songs on it except for "The Year the Summer Ended in June", but after listening to this album over and over I find myself falling into the music rather than listening to it. To me, the album started to become background music instead of saying to my friends "Hey, check this band out." The musicianship is awesome mixed with plenty of techy riffs and pounding blasts of the kick drum and I like the vocals much better than their previous release, but that is due to production this time around (produced by Devin Townshend of Strapping Young Lad), I still find myself leaning towards the EP for more playability and a more raw sound. However, this is definately an album worth owning and listening to if you like metalcore.
0	A Natural Disaster: I remember one time this song (featuring Joe) was being played on the radio and after the song was over the DJ said, "Now that's what I call a natural disaster!" Then he chuckled and said, "I was just playing! It's a good song!" That DJ knows darn well he wasn't playing because I and other people even thought this song was a "natural disaster". Mariah was just better off doing a remake of "Make it Last Forever." Skip this at all cost. . . Oops! I just realized everyone has forgotten all about this song already. Never mind!
0	Awful! Don't waist your money: This piece of junk stopped working after two times. Don't bother ordering this because you'll regret it. Hindsight is 20/20.
0	Amateurish disappointment on a major league level: This book was scrapped together with content almost totally downloaded from software makers' web sites. Not even edited together in any coherent fashion. The same topics were treated multiple times in numerous places. Mr. Roman may be knowlegable about PDF workflow, but it doesn't show in this overpriced, over-rushed, overly-complex and already out-of-date book.
1	Good book for a new developer: I've been trying to make the jump from hotshot user to developer since my job has me developing applications for other users, and I've tried a couple of Access books that just didn't cover all the bases for turning a fairly advanced user into a developer. I liked this one because I thought it did an understandable job of doing this.
0	Every time i S@#T, this is pretty much what it sounds like.: I will say that this cd pretty much sucked balls. If i could give it0.5 stars I would. The track names pretty much sum up the album. "Kill The Music", "Bored Stiff", "Pretty Dirty". Yup, thats the album in a nutshell. No metal element whatsoever. More like heavy punk with a bad-tasting hardcore twist. Again, it's to the drink coaster/frisbee/door stop/TP/whatever else you would like to use this cd for.
0	not a good book to start with: if you start learning UML, this is absolutely not a good pick. The orgnization of this book is poor. Some parts are reiterated more than 3 times, some are seldomly mentioned.Too many messy diagrams makes readers like me confused.
1	Unusual and surprising read: Recently I read the wonderful Peace Like a River, in which one of the youthful characters is a Zane Grey fan and writes poetry in the western mode. Remembering that Zane Grey was one of those authors I always meant to read, I located a copy of Riders of the Purple Sage and settled in.Like several of the other reviewers, I found the book an ambivalent read, but one that ultimately hooked me. The anti-Mormon tone is a bit thick, and the heroic cowboys are as realistic as James Bond. The sentimentality drips at times, and the dialog is stiff. Yet. . .the story is catching, and it is fun to see how so many of the western mythic and archetypal elements Grey weaves into his most famous novel. Great literature it isn't, but take on its own terms, it's enjoyable.
1	Great for Heels: I bought two of these and stacked them on top of each other. They were super easy to assemble and I love that the length is adjustable. I am using them for heels, so they work great. As other reviewers have mentioned, these racks are for heeled shoes. I read another review that said she just turned hers so it faces the other direction for un-heeled shoes and the shoes butt up against the wall. Makes sense to me! As I was aware that they were for heeled shoes and that's what I wanted, I would definitely recommend this purchase.
0	Hope springs eternal: I would truly, truly like to review this book, in either a negative vein, or glowing positively - thrilled with it's boundless content. Unfortunately, I haven't actually received the book in question, so there's really not a lot to say. In my heart I keep hoping that it will be delivered one day, any day, sooner rather than later would be nice. And, after the headlong rush of reading and absorbing the copious content (it's a big book after all I've been told), I hold addional hope that I will still have sufficient drive to get that real review out the door and on to the pages of Amazon where it belongs. Maybe next month - see you then!
0	dissappointing: I expected a mix of some basic information and new sources or ideas, but there was really nothing new here. This might be a good resource for someone who has never been exposed to any facet of financing a college education or someone who wants to go into a field for which the education can be free, but you won't find anything too useful if you've already made your plans, or taken out loans, completed a FAFSA and researched on-line unless you just need a review or the process.
0	Battery Life: I received the F800 in good order and time. The battery failed within a week after first usning it. I was very careful not to leave the unit on after using to insure battery life. Perhaps something else failed but the results were the same - - - in the garbage can!
1	Great advices.: Internet books usually have an "expiry date", because of the rapid changes. This book holds some timeless advices. It is an excellent guide, although on a general basis. The price is attractive as well!
1	great: Denzel Washington, John Lithgow and Ice T are great in this movie. I thoroughly enjoyed the movie and recommend it.
1	Hollywood action with heavy drama (4.5*): This moviecould be described as Cape Fear In The Ghetto - Jon Lithgow matching Robert Mitchum in the powerhouse acting department, though taking it over the top for Friday night movie crowd.Lithgow is a crafty thug who somehow becomes fodder for Washington's "15 minutes of fame". DW is a recent Law School graduate with a view towards making a career in Law enforcement. D.A. Lindsay Wagner sees the amateur video of Washington saving a hostage's life *and* saving the life of the perpetrator, so he can be brought to justice with no extra gunplay.Jon escapes from prison, reunites with his Arian Nation buddies, and sets out to do to Denzel what Denzel did to him - take apart his life, piece by piece.There is an abundance of witty dialogue and barbs at the media, which by1991 had already joined the junk culture, with sensationalism where fairness and accuracy once prevailed.Will Styles (Denzel) makes his TV comeback?
1	The first movie to actually Shock me!: I first saw this movie just 2 years ago. I had already seen Pulp fiction, Dead man, Straw dogs, Reservoir dogs and A Clockwork Orange. The hype about there violence was always over the top and I was never shocked, but Ricochet I had heard no hype for, and I was Plenty Shocked, which was a very new sensation. The film is great, but I don't think its the sort you'd want to watch over and over. Denzel is great, as usual.
1	CARLIN...THE CAPTAIN OF COMEDY: I am so glad I was able to purchase this DVD as I live in Australia where George Carlin is not available. I've loved Carlin since college...and the older I get, the more I appreciate his irreverent, caustic, "anti"politically correct take on life. For Carlin lovers, I recommend this one. If you don't know his humor, don't stay in the dark any longer! Go get a copy of this DVD immediately!
0	Only1/2 the lights worked: I bought 4 boxes of these lights and in every case, only1/2 the lights would light up. Awful product.
0	Blu Ray ok movie was not: This is for children with imagination. I watched this 30 times as a kid and loved it. I have no idea why its pretty simple and bad. Kids may still sit through it.
0	ThE NoThInG: When the villain of the movie is "The Nothing" don't expect the movie to have all that much in it. No sword fighting, not really even much fantasy, no swashbuckling, or fair maidens, just a lot of peaking through hole in ceramic dishes, cheap costumes, bad acting, and [bad] dialogue. (It's so bad it will probably make you flinch.) Buy either Princess Bride or Lord of the Rings or just save your money!
1	This movie brings you to a world of woderful imagination.: This movie is about a boy who comes upon a book that looks too wodorous to be real. As he reads the book he soon becomes a part of the story and ends up having to save a world of imagination called Fantasia. You will watch as Bastian,Atreyu,and the Child-Like Empress race to save this world of wonder.Its just a great movie and way too good to not watch in your life-time!!
1	DVD: In a cardboard/plastic box. Mine came with the middle tab broken so the DVD is a little scratched from rattling around. Can't really complain for the price.
0	movie: Bought this item because it was a old time favorite from when I was a kid. Thought my son might enjoy it. Was shipped fast so I was happy with that. However the quality of the movie was not impressive at all. It looked as if it had been a poor copy of an original.
0	TERRIBLE job, Warner Home Video!!: BOOOOOOOOOO....How bout the studio actually get's the director involved w/ this blu-ray release instead of just releasing a bare-bones one? Apparently Wolfgang Petersen wasn't even acknowledged of the blu-ray release, which he says he would've loved to have been involved with, see article: [...]Not even worth $5, let me know when a worthy version with some involved extras hits shelves.
0	nonononononononononononononono: I suppose most of you who are raving on haven't read the book. If you do you'll realise the movie is trash. It stops where the book actually begins! Whoever made this movie just ddn't get what the book was about - it has so much depth!!!! The movie is just superficial special effects. Forget it! The movie ends with someone saying how many wishes Bastian gets to have fulfilled. The book shows just how furtile the entire proces of wishing is; it is a mystical tour-de-force. The book is10 million times the calibre of a cartain litle wizard who is getting too famous for the good of him. It has depth. It has everything. Read it! ANd forget this movie.
0	Zero stars. Please don't buy this.: I'm flabbergasted that they put the dumbed-down tv version of this movie on dvd and not the theatrical version. They took scenes out, changed scenes and dubbed dialog to create this mess of a dvd. Not only that, but the movie looks funny. The aspect ratio they used makes the movie look weird. I was eagerly waiting for this funny, well-done movie to be released on dvd and I am bitterly disappointed at this made-for-tv garbage. This tv version will only appeal to an unsophisticated mass audience.Attention Warner Home Video: If you are reading this, you need to issue a press release in which you apologize for this garbage and then announce that you will release an uncut version of the movie on dvd.
1	Talk about a classic...this is definately one!: This movie is one you will want to watch over and over again. It is an 80's classic and has far outlived it's decade.
1	This book is good on what it hits.: But it focuses on IP routing. This book contains lots of information on analyzing IP routing processes but other than the includion of IS-IS, there are no non-IP routing protocols covered. A more appropriate name for this book would be "Cisco Router IP Configuration: Answers!". Extra credit is given for not taking10 pages to explain a simple concept like most technical books do today. Keeping it short and to the point brought my evaluation up from 3 stars to 4.
0	Mesmerizingly Dull: If you have ever been cornered by an innkeeper or B & B owner whose life contains five minutes of interesting tidbits, but who takes two hours dragging you through a poorly synthesized tale, you've already had the experience of reading this book. To make matters worse, the quality of writing and tone are comparable to a sixth grade essay along the lines of "What I Did on My Summer Vacation."If you are looking for an interesting book about life as an American in the Caribbean, try Herman Wouk's semi-fictional "Don't Stop the Carnival."
1	Please book the1st flight to Anguilla!: If you have had the good fortune to visit Anguilla this is 'must reading'--you'll want to savor every word, every moment--but alas you'll spoil the pleasure by reading this in a day. For those 'wanabees' do yourself a great favor--buy the book. The Blanchards have written a very entertaining account of their business beginnings--you'll feel the trials and tribulations but with the flavor of a delightful rum punch, warm sun in your face and trade wind breezes always at your back---"when's the next flight???"
0	Never mind: I ordered this chandelier for a small bathroom. I was very pleased with it when it arrived, but when my husband tried to assemble it he found that the parts didn't line up correctly. It was impossible to assemble and we returned it. Happy with Amazon's return policy, though.
0	Too gaudy: Item arrived quickly and was well packaged.Bought this light fixture for our daughters room. It's cute but the larger plastic crystals are too big and so they all hang close together and overwhelm the overall look/feel of the light fixture making it entirely too gaudy and cheap looking. The same goes for the matching table lamp.
1	catchy story!!: at first i doubted it'd be like old-foggie style and really boring, but the story is really catchy!!! i really love the ups and downs in the plots and the way the author portraited it!! and without Goldman's abridgement this book would be nothing!
1	Fantastic book - and more!: I love this book. I love this film. It is a rare gift to love both a book and the film made from it, but for many of us it is true of this combination. If you love the movie, read the book. And read this edition! Although I already own the paperback, I bought this new Kindle edition. I didn't know it would have bonus features - like the wonderful introductions to the 25th and 30th anniversary editions. The visit to Florin. The tour of the Morganstern Museum. Goldman is an amazing writer. So clever. Give yourself time to sit back and enjoy this book.
0	The Princess Bride1st (first) edition Text Only: I ordered and received a copy of The Princess Bride. It was represented to be a first edition which is why I bought it, yet it was not a first edition. It was published in 2003. The first edition was published in1973, a thirty year difference.It was an excellent copy of a third edition.
1	I love this book!!: This is a book everyone can enjoy It has Action, love, and is just a great book. I hope everyone will read it!!
1	The BEST book ever written!: I am14 and this is my favorite book. It has everything a book should, and on top of that the writing could not BE any better! It's exciting, it DOES have a plot, a very good one at that, great heroes, great villains, and Great Humor. In a few words: The Best Book EVER!!!!
1	Who are you people?: It's been some time since I read this book, but I browsed these reviews when I recognized the title. Goldman writing is excellent, and yes, its a good story, but you can get the story from the movie in under two hours. The book is quite complicated with an excellent, almost cynical theme. It deals with an adult's reflections on the fantasies of his childhood from the perspective of the grownup world. Life isn't fair, and everyone lives happily ever after, until. . . . Still and all, the narrator feels obligated to tell the "good parts" of this fictional history, showing the continuing allure that our youthful fantasies still hold, and our wish that life could be a fairy taleJust for the record, of course Morgenstern, Guilder and Florin aren't real. Where did you learn history and geography?
1	That rare thing, a hard-to-find cult book that made it big: Years ago, I was fortunate to the dueling chapter of "The Princess Bride" published separately in a book called "The Best of All Possible Worlds" by Spider Robinson. It was, bar none, the finest, funniest fencing scene I had ever read, and I burned to read it. I searched nonstop for 6 months, haunting used bookstores and calling in favors from multi-national friends before I finally found a dog-eared copy with half the cover gone.It was fantastic. Everything I had hoped for, all the humor and adventure and even some deep stuff in there about the human spirit and True Love, combined with the flush of discovery and triumph.A year later the movie came out and the book was everywhere. Ah, well.If you enjoyed the movie you cannot help but fall in love with the book. It remains one of the few I re-read every year and I continue to loan them out to friends and family.
1	An all-time favorite, read the book, watch the movie: Ok, so both the book and the movie can be a little sappy, some might say corny, but it's one of those in my collection that I have read multiple times. I've even purchased copies for friends and family. It's a light-hearted, feel-good story with all the good parts. Good guys, bad guys, love, romance, greed, envy, swashbuckling, great derring-do, betrayal, and more. But, it's true claim to fame is: True Love. Read the book, and you'll understand.
0	For once, the movie was better than the book: I love "The Princess Bride" as a movie, so I thought I'd like the book. I was so wrong.I slogged through it, hoping it might get better, and was disappointed the whole way through. Maybe someone else might find its sexist tone ironic or funny. I found it distasteful.
1	GREAT READ!: This book is truly awesome! I have read it every year since1997, and still look forward to reading it more. Although Goldman's little inserts get pretty annoying from time to time, he writes it in a font that you can skip over if you wish. I am truly glad that Goldman decided to edit this book, otherwise, i don't think anyone would be able to get through it! The movie follows the book very closely, but the book gives more detail and background about Fezzik and Inigo! This is my favorite book, and i hope you all enjoy it as well!
0	I liked the real book, but the abridgement leaves stuff out.: The actual book is good, but I think the abridgement leaves out too much. I understood what was going on, but the book could have been much more interesting if few or no passages were removed.
0	Not really...: I loved the princess bride. I liked the movie and I own the book. I loved the book so much I got it on my kindle too. But, being the idiot that I am, I didn't look at the authors name. So I started reading it and found this guys biography. Well fine, I thought, just a little authors note, so I just skipped past it. I read on. Suddenly I found an APOLOGY for the little notes found in the parentheses. I knew the original. I knew these notes were more then authors note, it is this guys personal biography written into the story! I think it absolutely ruins the story. The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because it is such a great story.
0	The Princess Bride by William Goldman: I was very disappointed in this book. William Goldman totally ruined it for me. He opens with 31 pages of a long, boring, rambling, collection of his comments about the Princess Bride story. Additionally he gives a page of his ridiculous comments at the beginning of each chapter. He really ruined the story of the Princess Bride for me. I would never have bought this book if I had known this edition was about William Goldman and The Princess Bride is treated as a side story.
1	Book club: My neighborhood book club read for November. I enjoyed reading it, I saw the movie in the theater many years ago.
1	Always an adventure,the first time or the fiftieth: In my short life, I have not found another book that can capture ones imagination. The perfectly woven tapestry of details and adventure keep you on the edge of your. . .seat! I have given it is as a gift, and my friend rewarded me by saying it was the best gift they had ever received. I can only say "Thank you" to the authors.
1	Did the Trick: This book was a great help when I decided to take on the task of developing my company's database! It showed me all the tricks and tips that I needed to get the job done.
0	I don't know what shape person this is supposed to fit...: This jacket is basically just a windbreaker, and an uncomfortable one at that. My biggest issue is sleeve length. Does the manufacturer think people's arms end at their waist?? If I bend my arm the sleeve chokes up all the way to my elbow! What a joke...
1	Nice: Well made jacket. Rugged, fits well, insulated without weight. My husband was very pleased with it. This was a hit.
0	Good songs but technically flawed recording.: While the 2 CD set contains some good songs, the way the CDs were produced shows serious lack of attention to quality. There are considerable differences in both sound volume and tonal range, and while some pieces are clear and vibrant, some are muted and sound as if they were being played in the next room.
0	Too big, too small.: Although the quality is good, there was no mention of the actual size of this cover. I'm only able to put it over the table, for which it is too big but not over the table with the chairs around it as it was intended to be used. So now I just have a too big cover over the table and nothing to protect the chairs.
1	A tragic tale: This book will keep you awake all night. Although you know Mr. Lincoln will be killed - it makes the reader keep hoping it won't happen.
0	A great book... in its time. Check out the 2nd edition.: This was a great book in its time. It helped introduce me to SCSI, and I learned a lot from it. Unfortunately, it is 5 years old now and SCSI has changed dramatically --for the better-- since then. I have been anxiously waiting for an update, and am excited that one is finally on its way in March 2000. IF you are thinking about getting this book, I STRONGLY recommend you wait until the 2nd edition (ISBN:1886411107) is released in March -- or pre-order it. At this point, this book is more of a history lesson than a technical guide. (PS, if not for the outdating of this book, it'd be a 5 star rating)
1	great: The item came in excellent conditions, well packed, very nice NEW, no defect, as i expected. . . . .
1	great movies: we have watched these over and over. this is a great movie and the price for both movies was so worth-it. these occassionally come on TV but with the disks we don't have to fuss with commercials and can rewind, pause, and enjoy the movies on our time.
1	Good movies: both like I remember them and good glad the I got them haven't seen in a long time, and i always find the movies i want on this site.
1	Even if you know how to write a Complier over the weekend...: and no one can teach you anything new, because you already know everything, I still think this book is defintely worthwhile. So if you are new to programming and/or Visual Basic this book is an absolute must-buy. Do yourself a favor and learn a clear, concise methodology from the get-go, before you fall in love with your own personal style.
1	Great product! It is 614: I have been using GUM proxabrushes. it is very difficult to find in stores. I usually get them at Wal-Mart. But recently I don't have any luck at all. They always run out of it. I am very glad to find it here. It is even cheaper than Wal-Mart. Shipping is fast, and price is great. I have no compliant at all. In case you don't know. This is model number 614. I assume they want to start using "tight", "moderate", and "wide" instead of model numbers.
1	Why make it from scratch??: I was a bit skeptical about a packet mix, but was very impressed with the end product.Honestly, it is better than my own home made - and that's pretty good!
1	A lot of fun: Another film that was showing in selected theaters only - not where I live!!!!! Couldn't wait to get this one after seeing a brief trailer. This movie was a lot of fun. I enjoyed the whole shabang. Easy to watch, great goofy characters, comedy, fantastic landscape, wonderful cartoon costumes, sillyness, and wonders abound. Fast paced beginning - a total improbable romp that is eye poping. Very hollywood, but with a Chinese sensibility.Recommended for the "noodle dish" acrobatics as well. Made me want to chow down on those darned noodles!Wonderful cinemaphotography - whats new - Zhang Yimou is an absolute master of cinemaphotography.Go for it!
1	could be cheaper: I like the .mac account, but it could be a little cheaper. Luckily Amazon sells it for less than what the Apple Store charges.
0	Forget the storage case: I bought this saw just to have a handy second saw in the garage. I figured the storage case would be handy, as it would be on the shelf most of the time. The storage case is pathetic. It takes longer to figure out how to put the saw back into the case than it does to go out to the shop and get my other saw. I'd give the case a negative star, the saw is about a 2 star.
1	HTC PM7000 Portamate Miter Saw & Power Tool Work Center: Excellent product. Good value, particularly because the worklight and vise accessories were included at no additional charge. Packing was not good because the end of one of the extensions was crushed during shipping. Customer service response was excellent, but the replacement part was also not packed well. However, the end result is that the device is well-designed and very functional.
1	AWESOME: This thing is sweet. I do however wish it was easier to get replacement parts (extra mounts for new stuff) you can pretty well only find stuff online for this brand. But overall it is great, why don't all the brands have power strips on them and come with work lights and a vice? Too bad for the Dewalt at Home Depot, I'm glad i went with the Portamate online.
0	Way to floral: I didn't like this fragrance its very strong and floral. It does last a long time if this is they type of scent you're into.
0	Clichéd: This is the first time I have ever written a review of a record on here and unfortunatly I've been moved to do so through abject boredom.This is the most clichéd, repetitive, cringingly bad record I have heard in a long time. I'm just glad that not everyone that listens to it will understand Spanish enough to shudder at each cheesy lyrics and forced stereotypes it contains. Really give it a wide berth.
0	Paradise Lost: I am innately suspicious of films that were bombs that later develope cult followings which appears to be the case with "Phantom of the Paradise" after perusing all the 5 star reviews(?!). I enjoyed director Brian DePalma's earlier forays into comedy with "Greetings" and "Hi,Mom" and later with "Scarface" but this film is virtually bereft of any humor, macabre or otherwise. This film does not work as a good rock satire like "This Is Spinal Tap" because it offers nothing resembling insight into that world. It does not work as a horror comedy because it's stabs at macabre humor fall flat. It does not even work as a good comic re-working of "Phantom of the Opera". The acting is nothing to write home about. I don't know what is worse, Paul Williams lame acting or the abysmally forgettable song score he contributed here. I guess this film can be appreciated on some camp level but you have to be in the mood.
1	Ready for something different ?: Phantom of the Paradise is a breath of fresh air. The first to give you split-screen and more is a classic love story. And good against bad. Root..Root...Root for the good guy. Hiss at the bad. Is it a nightmare or is it the music industry. Suprise: It's both.
1	High Quality Bag: I was looking for a small bag that I could use on day trips or hikes. I did not want a huge bag to keep all my lenses and accessories. This is perfect for my needs. I have a Konica Minolta 5D with a 28-75 f2.8 lens attached, along with a18-70 and a 70-210. I can fit the camera, lenses, my battery charger, and various cables. The lenses fit with their hoods on backwards. There are a couple of small pouches to keep extra battery and cards. Two features I really like:1) the micro fiber cloth that lies across the camera's lcd to protect it from scratches and 2) the top of the bag opens from the back for quick access to the camera.Small enough to carry all day, big enough to fit the essentials needed for a great day of shooting.
1	This completes the Kindle "Nuala Ann" Collection!: I originally had to buy "Irish Lace" in a print edition because it was the one Greeley novel missing from the Kindle collection of "Nuala Ann" stories. I'm glad that the omission of this second novel in the series was finally corrected. It carries on from Nuala's arrival in Chicago at the end of "Irish Gold" until her engagement to Dermot Coyne prior to "Irish Whiskey". It's nice to have all twelve novels in the series available on my Kindle.
1	As good as "Gold": Continuing the saga from "Irish Gold," Nuala and Dermot once again find themselves solving a mystery. However, the true mystery that is unfolding is the one surrounding their relationship. Greeley works his magic again making it difficult to put this one down. In fact, it took me only a week to read it. And I would recommend it to anyone. But, first read "Irish Gold" so you will fully understand and appreciate Nuala and Dermot.
0	Junk: Optima battery is garbage.. mine failed in 2 years and optima wont honor warranty because I bought it from amazon.
1	awesome.: This is an awesome battery. The only negative is the install into my 2006 Hummer H3 was a bit tricky because it sits weird in the battery box. Its not level and doesn't look right, but after pulling it out and trying to install it many different ways thats the only way it fits in the battery box. Definitely worth the money.
0	Viewer BEWARE! This is not a Horror Movie or even a good movie for that matter: My co-workers and I decided to watch this during a slow day at work. Judging by the cover, one is led to think...."Horror Movie" At first the errie atmosphere seems promising. As it drags on you realise it's meant to be a thriller and by the end of the movie it's safe to say homicide has been commited. That's right, this film just killed over an hour of your precious life that could've been spent doing something actually enjoyable. Nope, it's gone right down the toilet so to speak. This movie has one of the most dull endings I've ever seen, it's just a really bad, BAD MOVIE! Please heed my advice and walk away, otherwise, consider yourself warned.
0	Started interesting: It certainly doesn't lack a twist, but to say it's a clever one would be false. It really is entirely social commentary just after the middle of the movie, but not really social commentary that has any basis in reality or even political affiliation...it's a dreamer sentiment that implies adversity is wrong and elitist paths are the only way...that's not really what I thought I was getting into when I started a movie called "Tall Man" involving a creepy figure and child abductions. It's not to say I was hoping it wouldn't be intelligent, I'm saying it isn't intelligent. I gave two stars for the fact that it was an unpredictable twist, though a silly one.
1	Warming to the cause: After reading the first of this series I decided to jump straight into the second book and was glad I did. Following the various characters and their adventures without to much back-writing to introduce the characters for those who had not read book1 was a great advantage to being able to follow the story into this second book. The story continues without too many new characters to hold up the continuity. And so the adventure continues.
1	Not as great but still very good: I was a little disappointed in the sequel, but still felt compelled and interested in finishing the book. I loved every part of this book from beginning to end. Even though, at times, I felt frustrated by some of the slower movements in the novel. Still an excellent read though
1	Jordan takes off: While I enjoyed the prequel, Eye of the World, the second book far surpasses it. Unlike Eye, the Great Hunt gives no hint of ripping off Tolkien in plot, and the book benefits tremendously for it. Jordan is a master of running multiple plots at once. However, one thing he didn't abandon was his ability to describe things. His attention to little detail, like how houses are built differently in different countries, is the leading factor in his ability to make his world real. If his books keep this pace, this series may yet out do Tolkien.
1	Roads To Koktebel was ANOTHER great Art House Film: I agree that the pace was slow, but the story was very well drawn out for viewers. I look for films like this because, again, it was more about the disturbing (and somewhat depressing) story than 'the stuff that happens between the special FX'.Hollywood doesn't seem to make cool movies like this anymore (Except for "The Road")This wasn't the best film I've seen, but it was a welcome 'Change of pace' film, who's style seems to be disappearing. At least in the US.Spasibo and Do SvidaniyaJSIf anyone is interested, see if you can find (and watch) "Lilya 4-Ever" (or, depending where you look, "Lilja 4-Ever") w/ Oksana Akinshina ...it's a 'sad ...but very real' story
0	Lame: This movie drags on and on, leaving you depressed. I couldn't even finish watching it, I was so bored by 3/4 of the way through.
0	Como arreglarlo: Esperaba mucho de este juego... lamentablemente cuando por fin llego venia con las104 cartas.. de color verde!!!.. sin artefactos ni los otros decks...que lamentable que no pongan atención en esta manufactura... ahora tengo un juego inservible.. a la basura los 25 dlls
1	wonderful toy for preschoolers: My daughter just loves Little Leap - she considers him her friend. We spend hours playing with Little Leap. She has learned the alphabet and loves to sing along with Little Leap.She gets so excited when Little Leap asks her to pick the next letter and she gets it right. It is teaching her so many concepts relating to pre-reading. She is able to identify letters and is very proud of herself.Thank you for such a wonderful, fun toy.
0	Makes too much noise!: The sounds that the frog makes are very "tinny" and it is hard to understand what he is saying. I need to look at the letters/picture buttons in order to understand the corresponding sounds. Although this toy turns itself off, all you need to do is touch it or have something bump into it for it to go back on again. Needless to say, it is a very annoying toy and I see little educational value.
1	This Diverter Draws Attention: This is THE best diverter -- primarily because it is the valve AND trim in one!! I will, however, caution you to know whether or not you will need an extension kit (sold separately) to ensure that it is a perfect fit against your wall.
0	What a disapointment :(: Didnt like this series at all ... cheap production very disapointed.... would send back if I could ....would cost me too much in postage ... dont buy :(
1	Vermeer's Genius Revealed To All: This was the most interesting treatment of art and artists that I've ever been exposed to. The various art experts that appeared in the film went into great detail about the techniques used by Vermeer to obtain his wonderful lighting effects even showing, via infrared photography, that the artist had moved certain elements of the composition to make a more pleasing and focused work. A truly inspiring video. I can only hope that the other parts of this series come close to this level of detail.
0	A Great Disappointment: After looking forward to this recording with much fervor, I was very disappointed to hear the final result. The sound quality throughout is poor (the mike shorts out during Lou Reed's "Berlin," for which the liner notes apoligize), but other tracks are muddy, too, especially the encore, "All Tomorrow's Parties," which is further ruined by the voice of a woman offstage taking during the performance. Also, Nico suffers from an embarrasingly long coughing fit after she finishes "Janitor of Lunacy." Each of the trio have about one good song each ("Waiting for the Man," "Ghost Story," and "Femme Fatale"). The two "Bonus Tracks" are an insult to the consumer, just throwaway pieces that are not even complete songs, badly recorded. Even the die hard Velvet Underground fans should be wary of this one. The letdown of the year, and it's only Februrary!
1	WHAT?: These are great songs but I agree with earlier reviewers. This is not a greatest hits album. Why so few tracks over 2 cds? Roll With It, Whatever, Stand By Me, All Around the World, Hindu Times, Stop Crying Your Heart Out, Little By Little, It's Good to Be Free and Round Are Way are all BIG omissions. Especially Little By Little.
1	great shipper!: I had to purchase this book for my daughter's AP Biology class. The book was just as described. Excellent condition and everything included. I received the shipment promptly.
1	Out of Exile: A moving story of a life of the mind by one of Indonesia's seminal political thinkers and actors, it is a very human story of exile, love, love betrayed and loyalty to values we all claim to uphold written by someone who actually did so.
1	Wife loves it... which makes me happy: Got this for my wife's Christmas gift last year. She loves it. It matches our other bedroom furniture too. I was impressed because it wasn't as cheaply made as some of the comps. I was hopeful the back would be decorative as well, but it's not. No matter, no one sees that side anyway. Overall we're happy with it (I'm happy 'cause she's happy - that's how it goes) :)
0	Disappointing!: Although Juliette Binoche and William Hurt turn out imaginative perfomrances, this movie lacks dimension and reverts to the standard shrink/patient sketches through the middle of the movie that will have you sleeping on the couch. There was just not enough new material in the script to turn this into the comdeic romance that it should have been although it starts and ends well.
0	Aikido is not a sport: Aikido was never meant to be a sport and has never even considered itself to be. True aikido rejects all forms of contests and tournaments. Only Public demonstrations are given or should be given to show a display of constant training, not of ego accomplishment from the likes of sports where there is a winner and a loser. Aikido is not about who wins, who's tougher, or who is better, it's about personal achievement of mind/body. I must ask all to be cautious of such writings involving aikido being made to look like a sport or any competition. The founder himself and his family have always shared this view and rightly so. 2 stars for the knowlege that might be attained for the positive use and understanding of the art.
1	A really good young song writter: My girlfriend and I went to go see Jessica Simpson in concert and Ryan opened up for her and everbody loved him. He played about five songs and all of them where great they had great song writting and the music was very catchy and he has a great voice I really like "Shame On Me" on the new album I cant wait til his CD comes out Ryan is going to be the next big thing look out for Ryan Cabrera and buy two of his CD one for home and one for the car.
0	meh just buy the whole album: which has11 other songs just as good as this one. Just buying the single is a waste of money.
0	worthless: I was very displeased with this book. It is shallow bunch of trite, short notes on various seemingly uninteresting people. It's like "Chicken Soup for the Soul" only worse.
0	Yawn...: After reading just a little of this book you can stop turning pages because it's obvious what's going to happen next. Boring and predictable; I've read this book before, written much better, but never worse. Nothing new or original here. I've run into these stock characters many times before and that was more than enough. For me this was a waste of time. Has the obligatory sex scenes: yuck. Secret History of the Pink Carnation should not be allowed in same room with books by Austen or Heyer.
1	What are the critics thinking?: I don't know who wrote the reviews panning this book. I thought it was GREAT! The history was NOT inappropriate, and I found myself laughing alous, especially at Richard's family. It reminded me of Julia Quinn and Kasey Michaels--top-notch romantic humor. I can't wait to read the sequel, and I hope those who disliked the first give the second a chance to change their minds.
0	Don't waste your time: Quite possibly one of the worst books I have ever read. I think the author may have been going for a satire of the Scarlet Pimpernel story, but this book is dreadful. Clichéd characters, people who speak and act like 21st century characters in a19th century setting. Laughable dialogue, a contrived storyline, from start to finish there is nothing to recommend the book.I thought I was getting a good historical fiction, what I got was a bad romance book and most unbelievable of all to me is that this appears to be the first of a series.With all the wonderful writers out there, the fact that this book was even published is astounding.
0	How disappointed can a Book Club be?: Based on a review of this book, my book club decided to read it. When we then got together for our monthly meeting to discuss the book, our meeting quickly turned into a meeting of laughter and unbelief. How in the world did Miss Willig get this book published? Unfortunately, we all agreed that it is by far, the worst book any one of us has ever read. Between the 'zaps' and 'thumps' and so on, we were not sure if we were reading a cartoon. The vocabulary is not of the times, and the manner of writing is not only boring, but it detracts from a story which perhaps has potential. Between the12 of us in the book club, we might have read the whole book. Our suggestion is, please don't write the next book!
0	Dumb.: As a fan of The Scarlet Pimpernel, I looked forward to this book very much; thankfully, I got it out of the library rather than paying for it. I read the book in one sitting with a growing sense of frustration--nothing seemed real. The characters were completely modern, the war seemed more like a trip to Disneyland than a dangerous thing, and the characters were so dumb they deserved to get caught spying. There was no sense of realism to the book. Perhaps I expected the wrong thing, but this book seems almost disrespectful to the people who suffered during the time the book is set, as it has utterly no concept of their suffering.
0	Silly story: I read it quickly and thankfully it was soon over.Not much to the story except to highlight how one teacher dealt with her midlife crisis.Sky61
1	Christmas Would Be Just Another Day without Brenda Lee!: This is a great CD. But of course all Brenda's are. If you aren't in the Christmas mood, put this CD on and you'll feel the spirit of Christmas right away. The Angel And the Little Blue Bell will be sure to give you a tingle. I just love this song. Although I like the standards, it is nice to have fresh songs like Strawberry Snow and Marshmallow World. Christmas just wouldn't be Christmas without the dynamic Christmas music provided by The One and Only, Brenda Lee!
1	Obsessed: After just one show of Dexter I was hooked! Every season seems to get more and more interesting. I love this season and this show!
1	Great series!: I bought the first 3 seasons for my son and ended up enjoying it too. I can't wait until the newest episode airs tonight.
1	Dexter Blu-Ray: I haven't watched it yet, but, if it's as good as the first two seasons, I'll be happy. Delivery was prompt and packaging secure.
1	The series that keeps you coming back for more!: We've been watching this from Season One to Season Seven. It's truly awesome. Every season just gets better. You'll love all seven seasons from beginning to end. Don't miss any of them.
1	The best TV show ever: I have seen both season1 and season 2 of Dexter and just can't wait for the third one to come out on DVD as this is our prefered way to watch it because my husband and I become so hooked we can't wait a whole week for the next episode to come on. We would watch 5 or 6 episodes in one night.It is by far our favourite TV show full of suspence and twists.Highly reccomended to all.
1	Love Dexter: I have watched Dexter since the first show on the network stations. That got me hooked! When I learned that I could purchase the DVD's on Amazon I just had to have them. Amazon.Com has been great! What I like about Dexter is the fact that he lives a regular life while having this one secret! I watched Michael C. Hall on Six Feet Under and loved the part he played, I think he is great!!!
0	Just not getting it: Since many languages are based from the Latin, I felt it would be a great base. I'm having a little trouble getting into this one. I think it's because I'm just not quite ready for this particular style. I should have gone with one for dummies or something.
0	Broke my kindle.: In short, My kindle froze because of this book.When I first downloaded a sample of this book I couldn't turn to all of the pages but I liked what I had seen and thought the page turning issue was a problem with the sample format. I bought the full version. Big mistake. The book was slow to open and it took a long time to get to locations from the index. It froze temporarily weil I was turning to a page but I was able to get back to home. Something like two hours later when I tried to open the book again and an error showed up. I couldn't open it so I tried a different book that I can usually read. It also showed an error and wouldn't open. When I tried a third book the error apeared again and the screen froze. Now all I can do is put it to sleep and wake it up with the error screen.From the content I was able to see this book is seems to be a great resource. Just don't buy it for the kindle version.
1	Tale of Two Cities - Baltimore / Indianapolis: This superbowl V I remember as a youth barely and it was great to re-live this moment on dvd! I always loved Bubba Smith and the Baltimore Colts defense. On this viewing, this Superbowl V was not a very exciting game, filled with turnovers and some sloppy playing on both Baltimore and Dallas but good viewing anyway.I loved the commentary by Bubba Smith stating that since the organization left in1983, the Baltimore Colts players have been shuned by the Indianapolis Colts, the present Colts have no history of their team during the Baltimore years or don't respect it, what a shame!!This dvd is still a great view!
0	ONLY 20 MIN LONG! NOT A REAL MOVIE: Full price for a 20 minute short? I feel ripped off. It was my fault for not reading the entire description, but I think the business model of this film relies on unwary customers like me.
1	Overall Very Good: The cinematography is breathtaking and the acting is great (except for Bergeron). Powerful story. Worth two bucks to rent on Youtube rentals.
1	fleece bone pillow: I love this pillow! I have had neck problems for years and this pillow has really been a lifesaver. It is so comfortable and has stopped me from waking with neck pain. I take it everywhere I go so I always get a good nights sleep. I would highly recoment this product to anyone but especially those with neck pain issues.
0	Uncomfortable: I was disappointed with this purchase. I had a neck-bone pillow for several years that was just wonderful. Unfortunately I left it at a hotel and wanted a replacement. This one was much wider at the spot where you would place you neck. The additional height made this pillow very uncomfortable to say the least. I would not recommend this to anyone. Wish I returned this the first day I got it.
0	The 8th Man episode is incomplete: I have fond memories of "Tobor the 8th Man" from the mid-60s and I wanted my 4-year-old son to experience the character. Since the quality of everything on this DVD is cr*p, that was all I was hoping to gain. It's hard to say whether I accomplished my goal or not. My son has learned the theme song, but still hasn't seen a complete episode.Is anyone aware of a DVD of the original series being available?My best friend has a theory why we no longer see this character on American TV: Ever notice the "funny cigarettes" he smokes when he needs to power up? HA!
0	Customer service: Hopkins EASYLIFT Tailgate EasyliftMy easylif broke after approx11 months. I read some of the customer reviews and learned that I am not the only one that has experienced this issue. The reason for my submitting this review is to inform others of the outstanding response I received from customer service. They are shipping me a new item and have provided me with a return shipping label for the broken item. GREAT SERVICE!!!
1	An exciting ride!: I enjoyed the development of the novel and found that I could not put the book down. I enjoy reading Tom Clancy novels, and I found this to be as exciting in plot development as Red Storm Rising. Courtney Suttle took me on a trill ride in this novel, and I highly recommend it. I hope that more people find this book and will learn what I have already found.I cannot wait until I the sequel is published. Get this book!!You will not be disappointed.
1	Another winner: My kids LOVE the Magic School Bus videos. The whole family has learned something, and the kids watch them over and over again.
0	Misleading material: I purchased this book after taking the029 test. I can honestly say that the "test questions" in this book bear very little resemblance to the questions on the actual test. The questions on the test are complex and difficult (often taking more 4 screens to present), while the sample questions in this book are just too simple.The actual test is much more weighted toward practical how-to, and toward interpretation of complex t-sql scripts. The MS Press "SQL Server 7.0 Database Implementation Training Kit" is much closer to the mark, but still not adequate.More to the point is MS Press "Inside SQL Server 7.0." In order to pass the test, spend a lot of time examining t-sql and thinking about how to use SQL profiler. The real test is about SQL practice, and not about the "2-minute drills" that this author seems to think are important.
0	Uh uh, son.: Sorry about tomorrow? How about sorry for this unlistenable cd. Pick up something on Saddle Creek instead. Word.
0	Big Let-Down: The whole idea of the book is fasinating; I bought it without any recommendations because it sounded interesting. I kept hoping there would be a wonderful ending to tie all of the scattered writing together, but the ending was even more disappointing than the rest of the book. Don't waste your time.
0	Mostly disappointing: This is a somewhat well written book. Character development and dialogue are much better than in DaVinci Code. The plot is weak, however. The part of the plot set in the former USSR might sound OK to a westerner, but to me, a Russian native, most of it sounds na?ve and poorly researched. You might like this book if you believe in magic, alchemy and easy to convince in general. Otherwise read Umberto Eco.
1	Farm Torch: This is a really great tool. It burns hot, but is easy to regulate. It is of good quality construction and pretty rugged. I used it to burn dead weeds and grass. It will also incinerate green weeds if you leave it on them for a few seconds. Finally, the long orange hose eliminates the need to buy a dolly to transport the fuel tank. Be careful using the trigger mechanism (not necessary to use it). It causes the torch to go into after-burner mode, something like a rocket launch.
1	Fiesta Napkins: FIESTA.....what's not to love? These are great, wash & dry well and attractive to boot!
0	Price increase, not good for business: Formula, 5 stars! New price,1 star! Like the rest, off to Costco.
1	Art and Pharmaceuticals: An astounding, out of print collection of 42 reproductions, published in the Dutch pharmaceutical calendars, with an introduction by Dr. D. A. Wittop Koning, Pharmacist at Amsterdam. Full color pictures will be interesting to both pharmacists and artists alike. One-of-a kind books.
1	Great!! a must buy if you are going to pass: I just took the network essentials exam and passed with room to spare. The book took what I had learned in the McBook (Microsoft Press Book), and extented it to a "what I need to know". I have never worked in networking and this is the first time taking the exam.
0	The manga is better.: The anime would probably only appeal to fans of the original manga (comic.) For those not in the know, Kimera should be refered to as "he" rather than "she." I am not surprised the english released changed it to "she." though.Not being fluent in Japanese, I can only guess at the plot, but the manga is fun to look at.
0	KIMERA is and anime joke!: This is the most horrible Anime I'v ever seen! DONOT buy this tape! It has an excellent cover but the story and drawings where worse than bad! I only rented this movie thank god, and its a bad Vampire movie about Vampires from outter space. The women Kimera, looks horrible! When shown naked, which isnt even needed, she has a chest liek a male, nothing at all! Just a flat chest!
1	Woolf's last novel: Between the Acts (BtA) was Woolf's last novel, finished but not yet revised before her death in1941. It is, like Woolf's other novels, experimental. She takes some of her already established techniques and adds new things. She sets it in the span of a single day (i.e. Mrs Dalloway), depicts and parodies historical events (i.e. Orlando). Woolf centers the action around a village play (a bad play, but that is part of the fun). The social commentary on Britain is there, but BtA is far from the "usual British stuff." In the course of the novel the reader should look at the actors and the audience, drawing parallels to our own daily acting. Woolf includes a number of literary allusions. See if you can find the use of Gerard Manley Hopkins in the narrative, for example. As with Woolf's other writings, plot is not the focus. Even though she died thinking it was unsuitable for publication (she was mistaken), BtA is a fine novel from a master writer.
1	Pretty good.: I still liked this book but there is other chicken soup books that are more interesting, such as the first book of the teenage soul. I just wasn't as touched as the other books. But I'm still glad i bought this book, and I'm going to buy the third book. I suggest that you might want to read some of this from the library to see for yourself if you think it's worth buying before hand.
0	Doesn't compare to the first "Teenage Soul" book: I recieved both books for my birthday, the1st on my15th and the 2nd on my16th. I read the1st one at least 4 times front to back in about 3 months. I'm very sorry to say that the 2nd is no where near as good as the1st. I got it in November now it's almost the end of January and still haven't finished it! It doesn't keep my attention like the1st one did. I recomend spending your money on something more interesting.
1	Sad, sad, sad!: Every time I read a Chicken Soup book, I end up crying my eyes out... not just while reading, but for hours afterwards. It's a great book, but the stories are just too sad.
1	A paper best-friend: To put it succinctly, this book and the stories within it have become one of my constant companions, a place to go for advice, understanding, and inspiration. It has comforted me in my lows and shared my highs. All in all, a very useful tool for a girl experiencing adolescent turmoil.
1	Almost better than the first book!: I stayed up all night reading that book and even if I almost fell asleep in class the next day i consider it well worth my time, it was the best book I had read in along time and it helped me alot. My thanks to all of the writers.
1	Nothing lacking: I'm satisfied with the brightness, like the design. The mounting bracket seems a little flimsy/questionable, but other than that, it seems fine. And unlike some florescent fixtures I've seen, this one is instant-on. No waiting when you flip the switch.Suggestion to the manufacturer...make the switch a little bigger and easier to "feel for" when the fixture is mounted out-of-sight.
1	I love Willie.: I may wear out the CD just by playing it while in the car. The lyrics are so amusing and just fit the two singers and their life style.
0	Bummer: Arrived with the thermometer broken off from base. Could not return because of the liquid used in the themometer. =( Looks and feels cheap.
0	Don't bother with this brand: I ordered one of these buggers and noticed a couple of defects.1- it was incredibly low powered and 2- there was no difference in power level from switch 4 to 5. Amazon was kind enough to send me a replacement. The new one is a bit more powerful, but I honestly think this brand is no good. I have ordered the tlc space vibe version many times and have never had an issue. Amazon, I hope you discontinue carrying this specific product. Your customers are trying to give you some good advice.
0	Couldn't watch: I started trying to watch this and couldn't get more than 20 minutes in. Others my find it a good movie, but it was hard for me to enjoy. Other similar titles I like are Alfie, Californication, Fight Club, Choke, etc.
0	RoboHelp 2000 for HTML Help: I was greatly disappointed with this book. It is poorly organized, and unclear. It takes an application that should be learned fairly easily and makes it that much harder.When there are multiple ways of doing the same thing, the author lists them in a numbered list which leads you to believe there are mulitple steps involved. Here's one example:"Creating a New Window""To create a new window, you perform the following steps:1. Select File, New, Window. 2. Right-click over the Windows folder on the Project tab. 3. Select File, Project Settings. Select the Windows tab and then click New."These are listed as 3 steps, but in fact are just 3 different ways of doing the same thing.This is just one illustration of poor organization within this entire book.
1	Underappreciated WWII fiction of Panzer Grenadiers on the Eastern Front: Really good fictional account of a squad of Panzer Grenadiers as they fight to survive on the Eastern Front during WWII. This guy was actually a Panzer Grenadier on the Eastern Front during WWII and by the descriptions you can believe it.This author also wrote "Panzer Grenadiers" which is slightly better well known, but this is the better out of the two books. Well spent money if you enjoy WWII and war related fiction.
0	Collapse by Jared Diamond: the picture led me to believe that this was the CD set that I was listening to from the library.It may be my own fault that i didn't pay attention when ordering that I bought a condensed version.Be careful if buying this that you don't buy this disappointing set.
0	Pretty Basic: There is a lot of the author's rantings about big business and mining in his state. His ranting went on for nearly100 pages, then he goes on to talk about the fall of societies that were doomed from the start. I could have made the analysis that he made about the specific societies that he picked. Personally I was dissipointed that he did not get into idealistic reasons why some societies fail. I would have liked to see more about why very technilogically advanced societies failed throughout history.
1	Five ways Civilizations Die - We are working on it: An excellent book that details the various ways those civilizations can collapse. He studies civilizations that have collapsed, and extrapolates.
0	Surprised at how bad this was: Jared Diamond can type a lot of words, but he says very little. Much of the info is repetitive and rote as you can skim through all the historical chapters without missing anything. As others have noted, Diamond's failing is that he makes broad assumptions without evidence early on and it corrodes his credibility from the start. Overall, a terrible book I recommend you skip. Read the summary and you'll know enough to save your money.
0	Plates missing from the Kindle edition: This (excellent) book comes with two sets of images:1) maps of the places where the different societies mentioned lived (Easter Island, Australia, Greenland, China, etc.) and 2) Sets of plates with 40 or so additional photos. The maps are included in the Kindle edition, although they don't look too god. The screen resolution is too small, so they look very, very blurry and the text in the maps is utterly unreadable. I uploaded a couple of screen grabs so you can judge for yourselves. Can anyone read the names of those tiny little islands? Thank God we have Google Earth. As for the plates mentioned in the text, well, they ain't there at all. That's a sloppy digitalizing job, Penguin.
1	Important, but challenging reading: Jared Diamond is my hero, one of a small group of writers who've drastically impacted the way I view the world. And this book *feels* important and like something I should want to read ... but I'm struggling. I read a chapter, then put it down in favor or something else. Still working through it. I don't mean to say it's tedious, just not quite as engaging and thought-provoking as I found Diamond's other works to be. I loved The Third Chimpanzee, and Guns, Germs, and Steel is one of the most important books ever written. So buy this, own it, reference it, but don't expect to be wowed by it.
0	Interesting, but Halting: An interesting book, I found myself reading and rereading entire passages. Not only because I enjoyed the text, but also because the translation was sometimes so awkward that I had trouble making sense of some sections. Perhaps the next edition will be better produced.
0	A lot of phaff and only directX 5.2: First and foremost this book was written when directX 5 was the standard. Now we are up to 7/8 and I assume there have been many changes, at least there are some examples in the DirectX 7 SDK which use functions not covered in this book. The lack of complete code examples or exercies means this is definately not a tutorial and there are no tables to indicate it is a reference book. In fact, the book seems to be a collection of ramblings about directX and computer graphics in general. Maybe this was never intended to be a reference or a tutorial, but either would have probably been more useful.
0	Chasing Ghosts from an Invented Past: Hongo delights us with his poetic voice and I was expecting big things with this memoir. But doesn't a 'memoir' mean you've spent some meaningful time in a locale and are a bit of an expert on it? Hongo left Hawaii for California at a young age and knows little if anything about the history of the aina. His spiritual angle on looking at a leaf, stream, or hardened lava flow is somewhat interesting but the book lacks any meaningful punch because there is little or no characterization. I was expecting him to reconnect with people from his childhood but there are none. He is chasing ghosts from an invented past and the writing suffers for it.
0	Disappointing!: I don't like this book at all. A pity as it is well-written, with vivid turn of phrases Miss Laurens obviously applied painstakingly and lovingly. I like honoria, she is strong, independent and intelligent. I just don't like the hero Devil.Devil is the most stubborn donkey I have ever met! He is infuriatingly mulish, not telling Honoria anything, making decisions for her, and making me exasperated in the process. I envision a lifetime of saucepan for them both - Honoria will need a lot of them to beat some sense into this dolt.

1	cannabis growing: This is the most comprehensive guide that I have seen on growing cannabis. A must for any one serious about growing marijuana or curious of the process.
1	5 Stars: Amazing work, everything a grower ever needs to know. If your interested in knowing how it is grown and how people imprOve the quality of the plant, then this book is for you.
0	New York Times Crossword Puzzle Dictionary: The book arrived promptly, packaged very well. Not in as good condition as I expected but my fault for ordering a used book.
1	The best product for crosswords.: This is my second copy of The New York Times Crossword Puzzle Dictionary. I am replacing the first copy that I have worn completely out from constant use. I have over the years found no better assistance for crosswords than this product.
0	Disappointing: The potential for this to have been truly great is lost by the focus of the film. If you are not familiar with Mr. Carey's remarkable work, this will not supply too much evidence. The acting is fair. The actors who play Mr. Carey and the first Mrs. Carey are just not up to the roles. There is a bit of underacting and overacting here. What a shame that such an important story could not have been told better.
1	EMDR: This is a must have book for those using EMDR, particularly if you are new at the process. This would be the second book to buy after the basic text. It helps the new therapist see and appreciate how the therapeutic relationship is central to the use of eyemovement. It is well written and makes much clear.
1	Nice, Barely Used Cookbook: Minus some very minor damage marks on the cover, the book is like new. All pages are clean and intact.
0	For Programming Novices Only: This is for beginners only. Examples and explainations are very simplistic and do not provide the detail necessary for creating a real world messaging application. Much effort is expended providing information on using the Visual Basic IDE and on creating a UI. The code examples also demonstrate poor programming practices. I would not recommend this book to anyone. If you would like a good MSMQ reference buy Designing Applications with MSMQ by Alan Dickman. It is not perfect but is the most comprehensive text on MSMQ that I have read so far.
1	Never an IPOD believer..now I'm sold: I have never been a believer in the IPOD before. Always seemed to fragile and too expensive. I had a Creative Labs Zen that was sturdy...took abuse...but heavy...a bit cumbersome. I saw the Nano and immediately checked it out. Was I wrong about Apple. This Nano is amazing. I had it for less than 2 hours and put about 400 songs and more than 200 clear, sharp pictures on it. I'm sold! Also, all those folks who advise how this thing scratches, etc. I don't buy it. I've thrown this around my car, my pocket..all over the place. It shows some fingerprints, but that's about it. No scratches, no broken screens, nothing except cystal clear sound a crystal clear display. I love my IPOD Nano. Great job Apple!
0	BATTERY SUCKS: So I was the first kid on the floor with the IPOD NANO, I orderedone from MAC the Monday of release.It arrives, we all OOOOH and AHHHHHI take it home and charge it for the nightWake up at 5:30, fully charged battery, put it onand get on with my day, by10 AM the battery had DIEDCRAP!I call up MAC and they want to REPAIR this oneI say HELL NO! I just BOUGHT it, I am not sending this backfor you to REFURBISH it, I want a new one, and you screwedup my inscription, too.....So I am getting ready to mail this back, when I charge thebattert ONE more time, all night charge, fresh in the AMThis time, it stayed on from 7:30, when I started to use it until1:26PM, an hour ago, my NANO died from poor battery power.Watch out when you get these, I am going to return this and hopeI get a better one, if I get another POOR BATTERY, I am goingto get a freaking refund, this is BOGUSMAC should know better than to release a product that is crap:/
1	ipod nano 4gb-white: I love the ipod nano. It started when my friend got one, so I did to. I just got it today, and listening to it right now (Everclear- Father of Mine) and I LOVE IT. The case that comes with it is OK for now.I recommend getting the largest version (Max storage)
1	It's an iPod --- what more do you say?: I am giving it a 4 due to the simple fact of battery replacement. I am not looking forward to the day that it simply doesn't hold a charge anymore. But, I am confident that by that time, some 3rd party smartie will have an aftermarket battery solution. Keeping my fingers crossed....
0	Won't work with Windows: Don't waste you hard earned cash on this if you plan on using it with MS Windows. Windows recognizes the iPod but Apple iTunes does not. After 32 hours of trying to get it to work, I'm giving up. My expience tells me that Apple still doesn't play well with PC's.
0	No customising!: I should have paid more attention to the title. It's called "Administering" SAP R/3 and not "Customising". It explains how to use the different SD functions not how to implement them. Unfortunately, it cannot be recommended to users either because it is too technical and does not explain things in a comprehensive manner. There are some books that emphasise the business process and help you decide how to implement this in SAP. This is not one of them. This book is smack in the middle of a no-mans land. It's no good for customising, no good for users and no good for planning business processes.I totally agree with some of the other reviewers. Your better off with the online documentation.Save your bucks. Don't waste them on this book.Incidently, if your looking for a book on SD customising, I can recommend "Implementing SAP Sales and Distribution": 5 stars!
1	A National Treasure: This double CD is stuffed full of great songs and amazing stories. My favorite stories are of Elaine's date with Marlon Brando, what she thought some lyric are/meant, and her time in Compant. The total honesty that she brings it all together is touching and inspiring.Very few people have the length or variety of a career that Elaine Stritch has had. I am sure that she has enough stories to do ten more shows.If you love Broadway then you must buy this CD.
0	Disappointing!: This book was so disappointing! It lacked applicability to using the Active Directory.
1	Comfort food and reading...: The recipes in "The Country Gourmet" spin a tale of comfort as well as good eats. The remembrances of the author's mama and her love of food and life does more than feed the reader's soul, it gives the reader hope that there is truly more to life than getting out of bed each day; there are wonderful dishes to prepare and delicious people to get to know and break bread together with. TWO THUMBS way up for this amazingly inspiring cookbook/biography chronicling a daughter's love for her mother and her mother's cooking.
0	It had it's good moments: I'm not sure what to say about this book, I THINK i liked it... it's about a woman who wants to start out somewhere new, and on the way she gets a daughter and meets people... I wish turtle had said more... Barbara seems to ramble on and on... I'm not even sure if i would recommend it... I THINK i would...
1	A thrilling life size novel.: This book was great. I was actually made to read this over the summer. When I first looked at it, and a first glance at the title, I thought I was in for a interesting trip in my imagination world.Then I read the back and relized that it wasn't going to be all that bad. I read the book and loved it! I fell in love with the charaters. I sypmathized for the dilemmas they all went through in their lives. It proved that with out really putting yourself in someone elses shoes, you can't correctly judge your own life.
1	An Exciting Read: Unique in that the narrator and heroine, Taylor/Marietta isn't the typical flawed protagonist who learns self-confidence by getting a makeover or landing her dream man. In this book, Taylor already has a self-confidence that borders on cockiness and is full of spunk. She's a sweet, straight-talking narrator the reader grows to love. Her frankness is something readers will aspire to. Taylor travels to Tucson, takes charge of a young Native American girl, befriends and encourages an insecure new mother named Lou Ann, and meets Estevan and Esperanza, a couple from Guatamala living illegally in the states. The novel has a feminist slant, and is empowering that way. I got a bit bored with the subplot featuring Estevan and Esperanza, but for the most part was captivated. Told in the voice of Taylor, the novel is humorous and uplifting. The conversations are realistic and familiar, very real. Brimming with advice and inspiration.
1	Extraordinary!: Even a voracious reader (such as myself) can sometimes be unaware of a new voice in the land....I was unaware of Barbara Kingslover, until about a month ago, when a friend of mine handed me a copy of "The Bean Trees," mentioning that I "might like it."To say that I "liked" it is extreme understatement ... This is a book I wish I had written....It's all about the beauty, the glory, the heartaches, the joys, and the realities of being a woman alive in the world today -- without heavy-handed political harangues or in-your-face proselytizing. Instead, this book is filled with wisdom, warmth, out-loud laughs and a quiet, satisfying inner recognition of all that is truly wonderful in a woman's mind, spirit, heart and life.I've found a friend in Ms. Kingslover. I wish she lived next door
0	It's all down hill from the Poisonwood Bible.: The first book I read of Barbara Kingsolver's was The Poisonwood Bible. It was so good that I decided to read more of her stuff. Unfortunately, it's all down hill from there folks. Poisonwood is fabulous and I've not found her other books to be any where near as good. In fact I read The Bean Trees a few months ago and I really can't remember much about it. Barbara Kingsolver is a talented writer, but this one just didn't hit the mark for me.
0	Asimple REVIEW of us, ROger Ling, RAymond Gao,& Jonathan Bau: Dear Friends, WE have read this book, and other reviews, and WE have made a conclusion for myself. This book is a visionary, it leaves you open mouthed and sleeping (drooling too.)... although it seems to contain good topics such as friendship and love in the book, it is SO scrambled that the book turns into a jumbling piece of literature. The book contains random events that have nothing to do with each other, yet somehow Barbara Kingsolver uses extremely bad writing and a strong Tucson accent to tie all the events together. All in all, WE,Roger Ling, RAymond Gao, and Jonathan Bau appreciate the hard effort that Kingsolver put into this "interestingly unique" book, but next time she wants to write another book alike this one, we shall say, "Thanks, but no thanks. Think of the future generations." P.S. WE were unable to finish the book due to the book's lack of quality.
0	H8ted it: I thought that it was really boring, and the struggles that a lot of the characters overcame weren't really that intersesting. I thought that Taylor didn't bother to look at the world from any point of view but her own and was obnoxious. I also hated her friend and I pretty much thought that the only reason that the people's lives were as bad as they were is because they didn't try to improve it with everything they had. They were too clingy. And the entire Talor kissing the married guy really stupid and unsensitive on her part.
1	AN ENJOYABLE READ: This is a story about a Taylor - a young woman who leaves her small Kentucky town and heads west - hoping to make something of her life. In her travels, Taylor's handed a 3 year old American Indian girl who, it's clear, has been heiniously abused. When there's no trace of this child's parents, Taylor takes on the role, and by the time the two land in a small town outside Tuscon, Arizona, for all intents and purposes, Taylor is the child's mother.Written in wise and lyrical prose, this story is about loyalty in love and friendship, and about discovering how far in life these treasures can take you.
0	A very disappointing read.: The Bean Trees attempts to address so many vital issues: adoption, class and race, youth, feminism, yet these remain a shallow, new-age background. When Taylor finally appears to break down under the pressure of young motherhood, it rings false, her switch from bravado to frustration lacks depth and disappears as quickly as Kingsolver's references to the war in Guatamala.
0	Interesting, but poorly explained technique: I found myself rereading several times to try to understand how his "box theory" works. The author does an extremely poor job of explaining the most important part of the book as is evident by the questions posed by other readers in the Appendix. He focuses too much on the story and not enough on the technique.
0	Don't Waste Your Money: This book is an autobiography of Nicolas Darvas' life. There is nothing describing in clear detail the system he used and how he used it. Nicholas gained most of his money when he bought a cheap stock on a wim for maybe 5 or10 dollars and it magically shot up in price overnight and was restricted from anymore trading. He sold one stock that magically shot up for171 dollars a share, profit 250,000. I don't even think the results he posted were real. The most information you gain from this book is to buy stocks in a strong uptrend and that info is nothing new.
0	Entertaining but not enough details: I got this book based on so many 5-star reviews posted here. This book is indeed entertaining for leisure reading. However, it lacks the much more practical details in explaning what the techo-fundamental method he used is all about. The book did provide some basic advice on implementing stop-loss, limit buy, etc, to limit the risk. However, these are all very basic elements of trading that all the traders should learn in the first chapter of trading. In other words, the book only covered the story (and some stock trading101) which do not teach readers (especially the very beginners) what practical set-ups or methods are used to be profitable in trading stocks. This book is good if you are looking for a non-textbook leisure reading. If you are looking for trading methods (either technical or fundamental) that can help you to be better in trading, I think the "Mastering the Trade" by John Carter is by far the most practical book that I found in the market.
0	hope for the stupid: This book illustrates that if someone as stupid as Nicholas Darvas can make money in the stock market so can you.After all, it took this guy several years after he began trading to figure out what the Dow Jones Industrial Average was.Essentially, Darvas used fundamental analysis in conjunction with"stocks that were moving" and placed trailing stops behind them. Darvas never shorts a stock. The concept would probably be too taxing for his brain.Not a bad system. It supposedly worked for him.In my opinion,their are a few, and only a few, good ideas which can be gleaned from this essentially worthless book.
0	One of the VERY WORST!: This is one of the worst books I have ever read. The actual investing technique the author used is explained in less than half a page at the end of the book. The rest of the book is just piles of completely useless and irrelevant stories about the authors travel and adventures that have absolutely nothing to do with his technique or investing.The technique explained at the end of the book is one of the most basic techniques in Technical Analysis (TA). In the TA terminology, it is called support and resistance levels. If you are interested in this technique, use one of the books on TA. Those books cover it in much more rigor than Darvas' book and they cover a lot more TA techniques that are much more powerful. My favorite book on TA is "How Technical Analysis Works" by Bruce Kamich.
0	False advertising - avoid: Amazon claims "training DVD to teach you all the features & functions & HOW TO USE & MAXIMIZE your Garmin unit". What can I tell you? There are many many features and functions that are not mentioned at all. I have told Amazon to modify this claim and of course I am retuning it to them.
1	One of many great anime: Im13 years old and I love this anime.Why, not because of the action,but but because of its mystery,drama, and deph.Most of my friends loved the action,but they really never understood the concept of this anime.They just kept talking about it.It got me and other people annoyed by it.It made anime sound geeky and people started sterotyping the show and other anime.The show can get confusing at times but starts to come together like a big puzzle.Like the other anime on catoonnetwork people got only half of what the anime could of been because they wanted to make the show for kids.This show isn't always seriouse.It has a lot of funny moments in it.If you liked this I reccomend buying Trigun.
1	A Must Have, Indeed: While some may call the great reviews given to this anime "rants" and such, they're more than that. Outlaw Star is, to say the least, an anime that deserves to be placed on the shelf along with others hits such as Cowboy Bebop, Trigun, Gundam Wing, etc. The fact of the matter is that it's entertaining, has a storyline that grabs the viewer, and characters which one can become familiar with. People who find Outlaw Star not enough to be considered worth owning usually don't look at it for what it is. Entertainment. The anime borderlines between being entertaining and 'deep'. Because of this it gets alot of good reviews, and then some so-so and bad ones. But don't be mistaken, it IS a wonderful anime.
1	Great...: This show is my fav Anime series... its even my first..it has a killer story and very like-able charactors....
0	WHY??!WHY?!?!WHY?!?!: Why did they do this? why did they make a direct to video sequel to a movie that made money?It screams for a big screen sequel that starts off where the original ended.not a flick that takes a simple premise and dumbs it down,and cant pull off the decent vampire body burns achieved in the original.The thing that was cool about the original was that the vampire slayers were meaner than the monsters they hunted.In this one they are weak and it becomes your average cheap vamp flick.not to mention carpenters good name wasted on the box.And whats with that awful wooden steak gun bon jovi uses,its sad.this vampire flick sucks.
0	Definitely not Carpenter's best..: Definately not one of Carpenter's (who I am not a huge fan of anyway) best; it was written very lazily & directed (and acted) badly. Maybe it was the stupid/lame title, or maybe the boring plot. Either way, I didn't take much with me except the setting...and Bon Jovi & Diego Luna's prettiness. You know a movie isn't all that good when all that stands out are the looks of the main characters!
1	Come on....it wasn't that bad.: The movie wasn't as horrible as some make it out to be. It surely wasn't "the worst vampire movie ever". Jon Bon Jovi didn't suck in the roll either.
0	0 STARS: Los Feces: Jon Bon Jovi should definitely stick to singing because he's a horrible actor, but that does not even begin to describe how terrible "Vampires- Los Muertos" is...as horrible of an actor as Jon Bon Jovi may be, "Vampires-Los Muertos" is an even worse movie. Vampires, that's a laugh...this movie has a terrible plot and the acting is even worse. The original "Vampires" sucked too, but this one is even worse folks! Definitely one of the worst so called "horror" movies of all-time and that my friends is saying something!! Can you believe some people call this a horror movie...well, you can imagine what I call it...yes sir, I just call it rubbish and that's being very kind.
0	Dont quit your day job...: Dont waste the money on this stinker. Jon, stick to your day job of rocking teenage girls and middle-aged housewives. This is supposedly some sort of sequal to Carpenter's "Vampires" which totally rocked, Los Muertes is nowhere near being in the same league. Obviously an excuse for Bon Jovi's female fans to see Jon with his shirt off unfortunatly guys there are no gratutious female bod-shots for us to make this movie worth-while. Forget the fact that the plot jumps around so much that you give up trying to understand it and just pray that it somehow gets better before you fall asleep. Take some advice and rent it like I did. Especially if there is nothing else you would rather do than numb your mind.
0	Justin and the Best Biscuits in the WorldJP: I Didn`t like it because it makes me feel bad when I read about responsibility. It is also about family value and I like that. So, I give this book three stars.
1	Justin and the Best Biscuits in the WorldEF: I really,really thought this was awsome because they talk about cowboys and roping.I am not like Justin.I hate the night riders.I don't like his sisters because they were mean.So were the night riders.The Q-T ranch is cool.Justin's Grandpa is nice.Justin likes going to his Grandpa's.He likes to ride horses.One time they found a fawn in the fence!Luckly they got it out.Then they went to the festival.Justin makes a new friend.He Deos 4 actvities.He has fun.And Grandpa won the "Best Biscuits in the World"
0	great music, bad video: If you like the music of Pablo Montero, only buy this if you are a collector, it only has 6 songs, very bad extras and the videos seem to be very bad TV grabbing, lousy video quality. Not worthy of Pablo Montero. Looks like the music company who gave permission to publish this really does not care about a basic standard of quality
0	Not for those just starting ms sql server or ms in general: I was presented this book and told 'learn how to set up sql server'. Not from this. Aside from grammatical problems that make it hard to read, it presumes you know all the ms-isms, the microsoft way of naming or doing things (my15+ years experience is on other systems). Of several dozen attempts to locate a term or item in the index, none were successful. Best guess; if you know an older sql server, or are well immersed in ms and its methodologies, this book might be useful to learn V7. If not, look elsewhere.
1	Strange and wonderful: Another great postmodern version of a Renaissance play by director Alex Cox. THE REVENGER'S TRAGEDY is comparable to Julie Taymor's TITUS (Shakespeare's Titus Andronicus) or Derek Jarman's EDWARD II (the Marlowe play). The dialogue is based on the original language of Thomas Middleton's play, but the setting and action are futuristic. The movie is actually pretty faithful to an extremely bizarre play, which includes incest, necrophilia, murder, poison, and you name it. Apparently the 21st century has nothing on the late Renaissance when it comes to decadence. Christopher Eccleston gives a great performance as Vindici, the revenger character. There are a couple of scenes of lovemaking which don't technically include "nudity." There is also some violence, but what makes the play so shocking is the decadence of the characters and setting. Very darkly humorous and satirical.
0	Ideal for the Web developer new to the Microsoft tool set...: After reading "Professional Active Server Pages" and "Active Visual Basic 5.0", I felt like I was wasting my time with "Inside Microsoft Visual InterDev". The book is appropriate as an overview for an entry level Web developer that has had no experience with Microsoft development tools. At the very least, I would hope to see significant examples in future editions.
1	Baking Book That Takes The Cake!!!: This book is full of wonderful recipes that just prove that Maida Heatter is the expert on baking. I started off with the Zucchini bread, which is out of this world. I then tried the sticky buns. My family thought I bought them at a bakery. And they weren't that difficult. Anybody who has baked before will be able to complete them with ease. I recommend this book and her others to anyone who loves baked goods, especially cakes.
0	Magical shrinking leggings: These leggings were great out of the package. They fit perfectly and were very soft. However, after the first washing they shrunk quite a bit and the softness was lost. I wouldn't buy them again.
0	Big Fail: These leggings sit low on the waist, nothing like the pictures. Pitbull and American Apparel are both using this brand now called In Touch. The materical is thin but comfortable but the lowrise fit ruins them. I am a real woman and I need a little more material for my waist and back side.
0	Shrunk and See Through: These leggings shrink even when following garment care instructions.For this money the fabric should be of much better quality,they are see through.I doubt these will last.There are better choices.
1	Works for Me!: I've had these leggings for about 2 months now. I wash on gentle and hang dry (like I do all these types of things as it makes them last so much longer). They do sit a little below the waist, but that seems to be the current style and it's not too low. The legs are long which is great for me because most leggings are too short and then my ankles get cold. Not with these! I don't wear them barefoot, so don't know if the long length would be a problem. I really like the price, and they arrived quickly and in perfect condition. I wish I'd bought two of them as I sleep in them as well. Recommended.
1	Egg shaper: Bought this for my husband. I had a metal one but the eggs stuck to it. This one I thought it would melt but it doesn't and the eggs don't stick either. It's easy to clean. This one is a keeper.
1	WE WERE SOLDIERS: Sorry some people have been disappointed that this is not the soundtrack. But...the music is a perfect tribute to the film and the men portrayed there. I am a veteran and a close friend of Joe Galloway, Bruce Crandall and many more of the real life soldiers in the story. Randy Wallace did this album for them..and for all of us who have not had our songs sung. Listen to the words, they mean a lot to us.
0	Misleading: This "soundtrack" should have been titled "Music inspired by We were Soldiers" or something to that tune. If you want the actual score/ soundtrack of this film, you should look for the similarly titled album but COMPOSED by Nick Glennie-Smith. That CD is truly 5 star material.This album is not too bad in itself, if you are into 60ish songs but the misleading name is highly irritating and misleading hence I deduct one star from my true rating.
0	Excellent movie but very poor soundtrack album: The movie is one of the best Vietnam era movies I have seen but this soundtrack had only 2 songs on it that I recalled being in the movie. I wish I had saved my money and stuck with the movie instead of paying also for the soundtrack.
1	I LOVE this book!: I initially got Kathryn Marsden's little book on Food Combining which is a great beginner (explainer). This one goes into much more detail but still keeps everything so simple. Once you learn the premise, you can honestly create or adjust every recipe you already have and use. This book also gave information about medical conditions that respond favorably when we stop mixing all foods together at the same time. This information could help keep you out of the doctors office. My friend with diabetes is thriving on this program. You could honestly have more time, money and health to do what you really enjoy!
1	A real gem: Just as good as 'Silk Roads', music will immerse you in harmony. Great to study or meditate to, a real feeling of peace.
1	This album is a "OASIS" for kitaro-fans !: When I first came over this album for many years ago,I felt that this was MY kind of music!(this was the first I`ve ever heard from Kitaro)The music takes you away to dreamland,and you get SO relaxed..! (Beautiful!) from the very first note... Buy it,you will not regret!!!
1	brilliance.: crimes is absolutely the best album of the year, no questions asked. the BB have transcended all attempts to pigeon-hole them into a genre, and have brought a brilliant energy to the scene that buries everybody else. cant wait for an east coast show, its killing me! experimental genius. maximum ownage.
1	SCAN DISK SANSA MP3 PLAYER: THE ITEM BECAME DEFECTIVE AND AMAZON REPLACED THE ITEM WITH NO COST TO ME,
0	The dreaded STP error: It's amazing to me that there could be an MP3 player that allows one to corrupt it by simply uploading slightly more data that it shows. That's what happened. Pathetic. Playng volume is weak, the display is easily cracked, and now my son's player is a useless paperweight. I'll probably try to get it replaced, meanwhile I just bought anoter one. Search for "no space for Db please delete 4.0 Mbs to free up space" and just see how many hits you get. I really do have a hard time recommending ANY Sansa MP3 player when the very basic operation can render one useless; and it's not just this model, just search, and you'll see.
0	anything but an ipod: i got this b/c i was desperate for an ipod alternative, and it seemed to be a decent buy. my main complaint is that every few days it refuses to play songs that i've downloaded onto it from yahoo music player (it will still play songs i've transferred from CDs). when it does this it asks me to "plz sync the device". i still haven't figured out what that means. sometimes if i plug the device into my computer and alter the playlist a little, it's happy for another few days. sometimes this doesn't work. very frustrating. also, it operates on AAA batteries and sucks them down like water.
1	Great Value: I bought 2 of these for my daughters, who are 8 and12. (I feared that they might get lost at some point, and I didn't want to invest in a more expensive iPod.) The controls and menus are easy to use and I had no problems using Windows Media Player to load them. They love them and I think they're a great deal for the price.
0	OK if you ignore the FM abilities: I bought this player mainly for its FM recording abilities. I have an Ipod that i use for most everything in my library. So for under $100 i thought this would be great for what i needed. I was wrong. When the backlight turns off the sound on the FM is drown out by an annoying hum. This also travels over to recording. You can leave the backlight on all the time, but that will just eat power like no tommorow. Sadly disappointing becasue it seems this is the same on all this model not just the one I had. Dont by it for FM anything! Get a Creative Labs Zen Nano Plus like I did - cheaper & it works!
0	I was very unhappy: What can I say. I purchased not once but twice and not because I liked it. I first bought it about a month ago and was really happy with it and all of its features. However, after just one month it locked up on me and wouldn't do anything. I returned the item and thought maybe I just got a defective product and gladly replaced it with the same product. This however was a huge mistake since this one locked up on me after just one day. I returned the item and bought a completely different mp3 player. I hope this helps anyone who is potenially going to buy this product.
1	Excellent tutorial to Python language.: Learning Python fills the gap for a printed introduction to the Python language. The layout is natural and methodical. Although I had picked up a good deal of the material beforehand from the online documentation and trial and error use of Python, I learned quite a bit from the book that had previously escaped me. If you want to know what the buzz is about Python or are looking for an excellent introduction for friends and co-workers to Python, try Learning Python.
1	still a good read: Having read this book a couple of years ago, I still browse through it frequently. David presents a gentle intro for the Python beginner but I appreciate the quick summaries of modules and methods. In fact, I reference this book a lot more than my "Essential Python Reference". Buy this book for a good intro to the language and keep it around for future reference.
0	The Above Reviews are Phoney: It's some writer working under a pseudonym, getting writer-friends to write these horrible, long-winded reviews.
1	Rodan you bet: Rodan is a complete story. It includes people elements and the state of the arts special effects for the times. I have been looking for a clear copy of this film and this is it.
0	You've got to be kidding!!!!!!!!!!!!: This has to be the all time worst sci-fi flick since the mesozoic era. Poor acting. Poor directing. Poor scenery and effects...
0	Subtitles? Original Japanese language track? Didn't think so: I've always been a big fan of all the Toho monster movies and had been awaiting this DVD release with baited breath. Would this be the one to finally feature an option to watch the movie in Japanese with English subtitles? Evidently not. I'm tired of these great movies being reduced to cheap B flicks by virtue of awful dubbing, re-editing and the deletion of music cues. It's time they were seen as originally intended. I've been lucky enough to see subtitled copies of many of the Godzilla movies... all of them brilliant.But these tacky dubbed versions drain all the soul out of them... and are an insult to the great filmmaker's who put them together in the first place. I'm tempted to learn Japanese and buy the official Toho releases.
0	This book is not detailed enough.: You will find yourself refering to Novells website to get full explainations and instructions on how to do things refereced in the book. (thats unacceptable to me) I was disappointed with this purchase. Novells online manuals contain far more information and its free.
1	Ironpants for the people: The heavy denim material seems to wear really well and the workmanship is excellent. For a working man or for someone hard on pants, these are the jeans to buy, for they may last for many years. There are plenty of pockets, but the legs are a little baggy for the average-built person, still they look really nice.Hard-core denim wearers, here are the jeans for you!
0	Not Nearly So Good As I Had Hoped: After reading "Generation X' and "Shampoo Planet" I was somewhat dissappointed by this effort. The angst of the central character as a tortured father separated from a child is understandable but maudlin at times. There is something of Coupland's earlier style in the book. The childhood reminiscence of the central character recalls the author's work in "Generation X" and was much appreciated. The book on the whole is not the pleasure to read that his two previous works were.
1	Insightful: Thought provoking. I would expect nothing less from Douglas Coupland. He has his own unique way at looking at the world and it comes across clearly in this book
1	Catcher in the Rye, 20 years on...: This book is for anyone who has reached that point in their life where they question whether there is any logic to the seemingly random series of memories they have aquired thus far. The magic of this book is missed by the editorial reviews. If you read Catcher in the Rye and then grew up, it's time to read this.
1	These are our children!: How many books can you honestly say made you cry? I cried over these "letters" from young people trying to get a college education. They have seen such terrible violence and yet they find ways to write their hearts out for two splendid teachers, Michael Blitz and C. Mark Hurlbert. How do I know they are splendid teachers? I can only say you would have to read this book to understand. Michael and C. Mark write letters to each other, to their children, to themselves, too, I think. There is so much that is beautiful in this book that it's strange to say, also, that there is so much that is horrifying. I wanted a book about teaching that would offer something "different." This book offered me an experience that is unforgettable.
0	so horrible we couldn't endure it, only lasted 4 mintues, so boring: This is not words we are used to hearing. TOO many words, unknown words, Agatha gone mad. love to return this.?? Beth
0	Hackneyed magic realism: Hackneyed magic realism - kitsch and cliche.The cover of this edition features a quote from Marquez:"...unmistakeable reading pleasure."Surely the complete quote must be something along the lines of:"Even Stefan Zweig, in comparison, inspires unmistakeable reading pleasure."Read The Lizard's Tail by Valenzuela or Ship of Fools by Peri Rossi instead. Leopard in the Sun is unmistakeably dispensable.
1	Dali produces a little gem: I saw a Dali exhibition of his art in Melbourne Australia in june09. Amongst the exhibits was a 7 minute dvd of a surrealist love fantasy which Dali made in collaboration with Walt Disney productions.This film is a whimsical lyrical glide through Dali's surrealist world. Truly a little gem.I also saw some of his ink and pencil drawings.They depict a technical mastery which has been compared to that of DaVinci. Most great artists are masters of drawing.You won't be disappointed with "Destino".
0	Junk: Mine was dead out of the box. Hey America, you get what you pay for - there is no free lunch. On its' way back, needless to say.
1	Texas slice of life: Set in a rural Texas town near the end of WW I, the flu epidemic of that year is raging. The movie attempts to capture, in great detail, the tribulations of a family at this period of time: the war in Europe, the influenza, and their everyday routines. Death seems everywhere. A great deal of trouble went into getting the details of the setting absolutely authentic. It's a poignant movie, and we can identify and feel for the characters: the husband (William Converse-Roberts) and wife (Hallie Foote) who lose their 8-month-old child to the flu, and the17-year-old brother (Matthew Broderick) who wants nothing but to go fight in Europe before it's all over. A very real slice of life, with few, if any, of the Hollywood conventions one might expect. Written by Horton Foote. Worth a watch.
0	Possibly the worst Godzilla film made: This sequel to Godzilla Vs. Mechagodzilla makes its predecessor look like Oscar material. Godzilla doesn't appear in this movie until mid-way through it. When he finally does show up, Godzilla seems to pop-up out of nowhere to do battle with Titanosaurus, one of the worst movie monsters that I have ever seen.Being a rabid Godzilla fan, I looked forward to watching this movie. Unfortunately, even my five year old son did not like this installment in the Godzilla series.Poor plot. Poor villains. Poor effects. Not enough Godzilla.Don't waste your time & money on this one.
1	A Must read for students of all ages: Well-written with rich universal themes, this book is a must read, especially for the classroom.
1	Fantastic!: I LOVE this book! I thought about it for weeks after I first read it. This is most definitely worth a read. I learned a lot about Jewish culture that I had never known before and about people in general. I must admit that the book started getting a bit boring when they went into depth about certain things, mainly because sometimes the author went on for pages...but other than that, the book was very, very good.
1	The Chosen:Understanding: in reading "The Chosen" i was very pleased with the book. The plot was very touching as we saw the boys (Danny and Reuven) grow from the grounds of a baseball field to the advanced college campus. Their friendship was very strong and was normally able to overcome most obstacles...except for the silence that Danny and Reb Saunders had between them. Mr. Malter brought Rueven up in talking, so Rueven began to hate the silence simply because he couldn't understand it. i believe that that applies to much of life. If we don't understand something completely, we tend to write it off as bad, hard, or tend to hate it. i would highly recommend this book for anyone looking for a good book for any occasion.
0	Over Exaggerated!!: This book is based on teenagers. In todays society children can not relate to the characters of this book, The Chosen. I believe that I should have enjoyed this book a lot more if I were able to understand what the characters were going through emotionally. I felt the author would help me understand, unfortunatly this is not the case. When I first heard of this book, I thought I would like it, because I too am Jewish. As I started to read it though, I felt as though it were extremely boring. I was hoping for it to be abook were I wouldn't want to put it down. but as I found out I would simply try anything to aviod it. I hope others readers have abetter feeling about this book, and it enjoyed it
1	A superb story: 'The Chosen' is a story of friendship that considers and is impacted by the relevancy of an ancient faith in a modern world and the clash between the different ways of approaching such faith. The debates within the book hold particular interest for religions in which faith tends to also become a culture and lifestyle. Potok vividly presents both the joys and the frustrations associated with such religious culture. The story is beautifully told, the portrayal of Jewish culture fascinating and the issues discussed are challenging.
1	a great example of the struggle for zionism in the1940's: ok, the book may focus on the relationship between two young Jews, but the main theme they they are in conflict by, as their father show, is Israel. A state now, in1948, on only when the Messiah comes and says so. BEIng Jewish and living in a traditional family that obseveres customs that both boys do, i fully understand the conflict and was fascinated by how well a person who knows nothing about Judiasm can learn so much. I had the honor to meet Chaim potok and he said he wrote it back in1950 to show his support for zionism and how two people who are the same yet so different can cope together. They are both trying to keep the Promise. Read this and it's sequel. Both are simplely-written but powerful in meaning. DONT WAIT TILL YOU GET IT FOR YOUR READING LIST!
1	He reads very slowly: I like the guy's voice, but he reads slowly, and my students preferred to read aloud so they could "get done."
0	Ordered over a month ago and still haven't received it!!!: The person who I ordered this from took the money and never sent the product. I'm in the process of trying to get my money back!!! Never use them!!!
0	boring and waaaayyy too much detail: like most people, i was forced to read the book for school...let me just say, if you have insomnia, i recommend this book...itll put u rite to sleep
1	Good Entry HTPC case.: The Antec NSK2400 case is a good entry level HTPC case. It is a nice size with a pretty nice finish. It is a quiet case that cools well. However the 380 power supply is a little low on the power end, especially if you are going to build a new system as of 2008. It is limited to an MicroATX mobo, which considering the size and ability to fit in a media cabinet is understandable.
1	extra hanging space where you need it: This product is great for the laundry room, and I put one up in the master bath, it's great for laying out your close for the next day, or for hanging your close as you finish ironing them.
1	Great device: We did not have any place to hang my wife's dresses so they would not touch the floor in our laundry room. Installed this and solved the problem. When it is closed you never know it is there.
1	best idea: Just wanted to say that my grandaughter is so taken with anything that Elmo does that at18m she is so brilliant, LOL. she is enamored with Elmo so anytime we get something of his especially dvd's that she can watch, they are very affective. I am so greatful for these DVDs as is her mother!!!! He keeps her very interested in everything.
1	Up Down, Near far: Great intro to the opposite theme, up/down, slow/fast, open/closed. My son loves it and says up/down whenever he hears someone say either word. Elmo is a great introducer of concepts.
0	Disappointing: From the advertisement, we thought we were buying a lot of stickers. Nope. Just a few. It was very disappointing; the stickers are way overpriced for the quantity included.
0	Big disappointment: The version that was released on DVD a couple of years ago is by far the best. This version is supposed to be "restored"? My copy still has the scratches in the frames and skips every now and then. My biggest disappointment is that it does not include the reworked Raymond Burr version. Yes, I could have read that it didn't but I ASSUMED it did like the previous release did. For you purists out there it is a grand thing, but for me I wish I had of passed on this.
0	Misleading Title: The description of the book "illustrate them with150 inspired examples" is very misleading. The author talked about150 riffs. You are supposed find the actual riff tabs somewhere else. After buying this book, you may need to buy another100 books to find the150 riffs the author discussed about. Skip this book.
1	Interesting and informative.: A well done presentation of the story of O author and here perspectives on the book. The quality of the film is also very good.
1	Excellent work by a master.: Although it's not as well known as some of his other work this is Pohl at his best! Take the worst trends of society right now and that's where this book starts. This is the sequel to Space Merchants and in some ways it's a redrafting of that story. Excellent.
1	Pretty Good: My son really likes the "Dave Series". It's very informative and funny for my 4 year old. The only thing I didn't care for about this series is that Dave seems to get angry (in a funny way) a little too much. My son has commented about Dave hitting Becky.
0	High speed adventures: I bought 4 dvd's from the real wheels collection and was very disappointed. Lots of commentary and very little shots of things in action. Did not keep the attention of my preschooler--or the adults watching with him.
1	Robert Frost: For anyone who love Robert Frost poetry this book is an amazingly wonderful read. With each poem is an article telling about the circumstances when the poem was written. In this way more understanding of the poem evolves.
0	Grossly Outdated Material: While this may have been a very good book in1979, the, avian information gained over the last 20 years makes these older book obsolete, if not down right dangerous. These older books should remain out of print. I would recommend a more recent publication including periodicals such as "Bird Talk" magazine with up to the minute articles from today's (1999) experts. I've kept African Grey's for almost10 years now.
1	A must have for the Godzilla collection...: I am not sure what the fascination is with Godzilla but my son loves these monsters. This collection is good for the "b-movies" of Godzilla. I was not aware of the monster symbols noting the monsters contained in all the Godzilla dvds(but now I know). This is very good price for amount of Godzilla dvds you get. I would say that this is good quatity-wise rather quality. However my son loves it, so we will rate this with 4 stars...and I was told by him that it is a must-have for the Godzilla collectors :)
1	Audio is underrated...: I found this review to be clear, concise, and have lots of great information particularly useful on the exam. I wouldn't go so far as to say this should be your only resource, but as I was taking the Network+ I found myself remembering a lot of answers because I had read them, heard them, and spoken them. This audio review is very well produced, and the speaking parts are done very well. Also, this is a study resource that can be used while you are doing other things such as exercising, driving, or even sleeping at low volume. Credit to Coriolis for another fine product.
0	Shallow coverage of servlets, may be of use for beginners: I flicked through this title in the bookshop, while looking for some good servlet titles. The coverage of this book is pretty shallow - for example their only mention of cookies is an API listing. Most servlet books cover cookies and session management, as well as more advanced (but related) servlet topics. I'd highly recommend "Inside Servlets : Server-Side Programming for the Java Platform" by Dustin R. Callaway instead.
1	100 Times Better Than Jason Hunter's book...: This is a great book on Servlets. I don't understand why there are so many bad reviews on this book. It teaches you the basics and goes beyond the API docs.If you want a thorough walkthrough of the Java Servlet FAQ, then go grab the book by Jason Hunter :-).
0	Who edited this thing?: The book seems like a bomb someone dropped then ran. They leave no contact information for book updates, like they don't want you to find them. After reading through it and using some of the code samples, I found they were terribly written. I also found completely false information inside. They state, and I quote "The POST method on the other hand, causes the data to be encrypted and sent in a seperate transmission". - Which is completely false. If this is dead wrong, who knows what else in there is?? This guy gives servlets a bad name... where are the other servlet books?
1	Absolutely terrific !1: LOVED IT ! What a great story. Gabe and Kelsey are great together. Both strong and gentle. Suspenseful to the very end. This story has it all, passions that sizzles, suspense that hold you and characters that make to you love them or HATE them, there is no in between. Read it and try to put it down.
1	True Betrayals: This book starts with a woman named Kelsey who is trying to get over her divorce, she gets a letter in the mail and finds out the mother who she thought was dead is really alive. She goes to Naomi's farm and finds out that her mother was in prison for killing a man. She decides to stay go and stay at the farm to get to know her mother, she meets a man and starts to date him. Various things start going wrong and old enemies start coming back. I liked this book; it was a quick entertaining read for me. It's a love story with a little bit of mystery thrown in. It's not just about a romance though it's the story of a woman who is finally learning who she really is. While the heroin meant to go and connect with her mother what she really does is find out how strong she is and what she is capable of. She learns that she can stand on her own two feet and a person's history is not always the way it looks on paper. This is a good book to read when you want to sit back and relax.
0	Old map: This map is out dated and doesn't show many of the secondary roads. I lost this map the first day that I was in Belize, and never missed it. The free map from the department of tourism was just as helpful, if not as detailed.
1	Just what I needed: Having recently bought a jeep, this book was just what the doctor ordered. It's loaded with well written reviews and recommendations for off road adventures all around southern California. I've already done a few of the trails from the book and the reviews and info were very accurate. If you're new to off-roading in southern California, this one is a must.
1	4-Wheel Drive Trails: This book is very helpful to the novice or experienced off roader. It is very descriptive of trails, landmarks, and gives you a accurate mileage counter at needed intervals along the way. This book grades the trails into three classes, easy, for most high profile 2wd or 4wd vehicles, moderate, for 4wd vehicles with lower gearing and somewhat experienced drivers, and then there is difficult, for the experienced driver with specialized modifications like diff. lockers, suspension lift, recovery devices and the willingness to have some damage done to the body or drive train of your vehicle. I would highly recommend this book.
0	disappointing and overpriced: This14.95 PAMPHLET is totally overpriced. This zine is so basic that its almost not even like learning flamenco at all. Its a bit like trying to learn flamenco from someone who studied it by watching a video tape frame by frame and is trying to describe the steps to you. The castenets section looks usable, but then i do not know how to play the castenets. Also irritating is the fact that its not worth14.95! At 3 dollars, this would be a decent extremely general introduction to the dance,...its a total ripoff. The wait time is probably so that the printer can run off a copy on threr inkjet machine and send it out. (its a PAMPHLET!) ps yes i take flamenco classes, hoping this would be a good complement. And its not.
1	This book is a must read for anyone: This book takes you from group homes to the mean streets of Harlem where Claude Brown tested fate and even some of societies taboos yet was able to pull himself up from the ghetto. He looks at child hood frineds that slipped through the cracks of society that became heroin addicts, pimps, players, pushers, and prostitutes. He shows exactly what life in the ghettos is all about the pain and the suffering. I've read this book three times and it gets better each time.
0	Avid true crime reader but;....: this book was the only book I have purchased in true crime that I could not get into. I would be lucky if I read10 pages. I only wish I could have returned it!
1	Fun: This is the best comic book game out there. The actors capture the characters perfectly. Especially Spider-Man. The graphics are great for Playstation. It's just a fun game to play. Oh, and for the people who are THPS fans, this game is run on the same engine.
0	Horrible Printing: The printing in this book is the smallest I have ever seen - almost unreadable. Also the book has hundreds of spelling mistakes. It seems every word that should start with 'h' starts with 'b'. How can this occur in the age of spell-checkers? Chesterton deserves better. This printing is absolute garbage. The producers of this book should be ashamed of themselves.
0	Low Quality Edition Full of Errors: This edition must have been created by scanning an older one, and then neglecting to proofread the results. It is full of typos, omitted words and wrong words, which makes it very hard to read. The typesetting is also of very low quality, which also makes it hard to read. Amazon should really pay a little attention to the books they accept for sale. It would be nice to be able to assume that a book you find on Amazon meets some minimum standard.
0	Good book ruined by an incompetent publisher: This may have been a fine work in its original form, but this edition (Wilder Publications, 2008) is so shoddy, it isn't worth the effort to try to read it. Based on my own experience with OCR software, I would guess that this publisher scanned an old copy, translated it to text, then reformatted it, and printed it. There is no evidence that anyone proofread it prior to printing. It it doubtful that it was even run through a spell-check program. Periods are missing at the ends of sentences; words are left out; "d", "h", and "b" are confused; apostrophies are inserted randomly (probably fly-spots on the original), "and" repeatedly appears as "an", "modern" almost always appears as "modem", etc. ad infinitum.I read through about a fourth of the book before giving up in exasperation.
0	Disappointing: I was initially excited about this book.Hearing claims of wit and graceful apologetics. Sadly I was disappointed I actually wanted this book to be good. It seemed hard to follow and the points or arguments that were used were poor.They could've easily been refuted with other arguments that I didn't even agree with. I know that wasn't the main point of the book but honestly after reading it I'm not sure I know what that was anyway.
0	Great book, terrible publishing: There's no question in my mind that Chesterton was one of the most brilliant thinkers and writers of the 20th century. He's amazingly insightful, searching out the big questions of existence with easy, witty prose.Unfortunately this particular edition of The Everlasting Man represents the worst commercial publishing I have ever seen. It is printed in tiny, poorly spaced text, with innumerable typos making nonsense of sentences and resulting in a very frustrating reading experience. Pay a little more for a decent edition!
0	Egregiously cheap, nasty, and overpriced edition of great book: This, the Wilder Publications edition of The Everlasting Man, is an egregiously cheap and nasty edition of a great book. It is printed on oversize pages with very narrow margins in an apparent effort to reduce printing costs to a minimum. Overall, the production quality is on a par with an instruction manual that might come with a no-name hair dryer or computer part from East Asia, or, actually my first thought was off-brand Dungeons & Dragons extension materials circa1976. You will be much happier with the Ignatius Press edition for only $1.00 more, which is the one I would have gone for had it been easier to locate on Amazon. I plan to return this and get the Ignatius Press version instead, or possibly Volume 2 of the Collected Works.
0	Misleading book: This seems to be a converted thesis to book, not the worst job but certainly without much effort. I'm not surprised its not in stock.
0	It is NOT a starter kit, just a DVD!: What you are buying is just a dvd, not the starter kit that is shown on the costumer images... and the one I bought never started playing, not even once.
1	Previous reviewer reasonably unhappy: I understand perhaps why the previous reveiwer was unhappy about this new book. Although I am relatively new to Kohl, this book is somewhat repetitious. It feels more like an overview of some of Kohl's work in schools, with some noticeable development of his critical ideas. Kohl details his ideas about stupidity in the current public school system (related to his idea of "not-learning" in "I Won't Learn from You") and he has some pretty strong words for special education programs and the flood of ADD/ADHD "cases" in our schools. It's a good book, definitely worth a read; however, if you know Kohl's work intimately, you might be happier borrowing it from the library instead of shelling out $20.
1	Blue Ray vs DVD: I own both the original DVD and the Blue Ray Disc of this movie. I have played them both and it is impossible to compare the two together. The Blue Ray Disc offers much more clarity and sound to that of the standard DVD. It was given to me as a present and I plan to gradually replace my standard DVD's - at least those I particularly want to see in Blue Ray - to get the most out of the movie experience.I highly recommend this product to those interested in an incredible Visual and Audio experience.Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World [Blu-ray]
1	Off the Chain!: I don't know why this film didn't get more attention? The authenticity is amazing,down to the actors wardrobe! Russell Crowe is Capt.Jack Aubrey, a hard nosed,sail with your gut Captain. Though he shows a tender side as well. This is a MUST see for action fans and Drama fans alike! Scrip is well wrote,storyline takes you on a trip through the unforgiving waters of the southern atlantic ocean, even to the Galapogos Islands! Again, a must see folks! Take it from a movie junkie,a person who can watch all the Star Wars movies and then watch Girl Interupted with the same attention!
0	The longest plane trip ever: Master and commander, well Russel was nominated for his acting, all the reviews said how good it was, I think they must have shown it at the morgue as it was DEAD boring.... I had a flight to take and great the movie was Master and Commander. So with great anticipation I sat down to enjoy this raved about movie. I have never known a 3 hour flight to last for 6 and a half hours, well that's how long it seemed to take for this movie to finish. I had to go to the WC half way through the movie, even without sound it looked boring. Down the back of the plane were the air crew, each with their own portable DVD players watching other movies.. I wonder why??? The most boring dead beat story to come to the big screen in the past10 years..... Don't waste your money!!!!!!!
1	An Excellent Naval War; Strategy and Action Movie...: If you like war,naval sea,history and strategy movies, do not miss this one. Master and Commander will be your Number1 movie for this category..Russel Crove is at his best along with Gladiator where he puts out the smart captain character smoothly along with the story. Have been watching this movie twice a month since I have bought it. Do not hesitate and add this item to your shopping cart and your collection, you will be happy for sure...
1	Good movie: This is a very good movie, with the exception scene of the character with the cannonball (if you've seen the movie, you know what I mean). This movie features two great battle scenes and shows a decent "slice of life" for an English ship in the Napoleonic Wars and shows the cunning of two great captains as they chase and fight their way around South America.I hope that Russell Crowe and company make more of these since they come from a series of books. I'll watch them all.I recommend that the home viewer use the close captioning so that he or she can read all of the great lines used by the Englishmen used during the battle scenes. My favorite is used by one of the men in a rowboat who yells at the others, 'Pull! Pull like you're pulling a Frenchman off of your mother!'
0	Defective DVD: "Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World" is a great movie. However, I received a defective DVD which made the middle third of the movie unviewable. When looking at the readable side of the DVD after the movie froze part way through chapter13, I could clearly see the defective area. It looked as though someone had spilled a bit of acid on that part of the DVD.Amazon.com's website instructed me to go to the manufacturer for replacement of manufacturer defects.The manufacturer, 20th Centry Fox, provided me with return instructions and I shipped the DVD and information to them on Oct. 30th 2006. I paid for the return shipping, and presumable there will be no other charges to get the replacement DVD.It is now Nov.11th and I am still waiting for my replacement DVD.
0	Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz: Wow! Am I ever happy I did not spend10 bucks to see this in the theater. It is possibly the most boring movie I have ever seen. Granted, I am not particularly interested in this genre, but even my boyfriend, who was all hyped up to see this, was bored senseless.
0	Damaged DVD: This DVD was damaged and I was not able to view it. It was returned and picked up on1.4.10 and I have not yet received a credit for it. Please let me know how to proceed and receive my credit so I can purchse another DVD. I was very excited about viewing it and would still like the opty to do so. Thank you.
0	A movie about blond hair, mostly: A British warship in the Pacific is taken by surprise and pounded hard by a bigger, faster, better designed and better armed French warship during the Napoleonic wars.Nevertheless, the British give chase and we kinda know they will prevail because they are ... blond.This is confirmed by the few scenes where you actually get to see some Frenchmen. They are shaggy, dirty, grim, and, unfortunately for them, not blond.So everything makes sense.Entertaining, mostly of you are blond and not French.
0	Beautiful But Boring: England is at war with France. Russell Crowe plays a sea captain chasing after an American-made French ship. Not throughout the entire movie was I made to feel like I had to chase the ship too. I never felt the obsession on the level I was intended to. First it was a Moby Dick movie, then it was something else, then back to Moby Dick again. I took a break1/3 of the way through to come back in to one of the crew jumping off the ship to commit suicide. I would have jumped too if I were in this movie.If you like cinematography, it was absolutely gorgeous. But you might want to wait to rent. There are far too many other good movies releasing this time of year to see instead.
1	Good movie, better disc!: I didn't know what to expect, in fact, I actually expected this to be a long drawn out movie. However, I was pleasantly surprised. It has a good story that keeps your interest. Although the picture quality of this blu ray is excellent, the sound steals the show. Those with a capable speaker setup (especially the sub) will benefit the most. In the first scene it sounded and felt like the canon ball was going straight through my room. There are even times where it seems like things were gonna fall on my head. If you've never seen this movie, I would rent it first. If you have seen the movie, I wouldn't hesitate to pick up this blu ray just for its demo worthy soundtrack.
1	Top notch audio, video unimpressive and no extras: I really liked this movie in the theater and on dvd. Sound design and delivery is top notch on this blu-ray version. The video is somewhat of a disappointment to me. The video seems to lack the punch that I know blu-ray can deliver. Not much is offered in the extras department. Overall, I was expecting a little more than I received.
1	For God and Country: The production values of this film are excellant and the script is first rate. The overall performance of the entire cast is also excellant. However, the viewer knows what is going to happan in this movie as soon as it starts. The good guys(the English) are going to win. The entire film is a trip to this end- the only mysteries being who of the not most major actors in this film are "killed" in the battles to come and how the British captain defeats a bigger, faster, and better armed French ship. This is not to make lite of this film, it is entertaining and interesting. Just how many times you will rewatch this film- the purchaser will have to decide.
0	Yuck: Worst Russell Crowe movie I ever saw and I really like Russell Crowe. He did not really have a lot of lines to say. The movie was very boring in my opinion.
0	no go: my husband got himself all set up for a peaceful aftenoon viewing, this was short lived as DVD announced could only be played in 'A' zone.
0	Expect nothing and you may not be disappointed: I walked out of this film with nothing, no sense of exhilaration (like one gets with good action sequences), no warmth, as with a great story that you just learned about, there were some good visuals, and the audio was strong (you felt a chill from the rain and wind from THX) - but that was by far the highlight.I laugh when I read the reviews from Big Name reviewers that say such great things about this film. I guess politics in Film reviewing is no different than any other politics - people will say what they need to when the perks / or $ is good enough. (Hell, if our President is doing it - why shouldn't a movie reviewer).
0	most disappointing of any Crowe film...........: The story basically is Aubrey chasing around in the southern part of the hemisphere after a French man'o'war.....that is it...I found it (extremely)tedious and annoying.One of the most distracting part of it was the noise.The dialogue was often drowned in it.....Frankly I think Weir should have spent a bit more time on character development........If you think that this film is exciting, then you probably would love watching grass grow.......
0	waste of time......: I wanted so bad to like this movie, but unfortunately I could not. This movie almost put me to sleep, oh it's true. I had a hard time understanding the dialog so I was forced to use the english subtitles. There's almost zero action in this movie and even the one battle scene was weak. Too much talking and playing violins.(hee haw!) Very, very boring movie. I'm sorry guys but this one sucks bad... Real Bad!....... Can you dig it?
1	Good step by step guide: The book is spoton and easy to follow. However I need to use scripting for version 4.0b. Is there one available for that? Is there one coming out soon?
1	Outstanding: This was my first O'Reilly book, and one I've used ever since as a yardstick of what they're capable of producing.Faced with the daunting task of writing a compiler, I discovered this book and was amazed at the wealth and depth of information it contains.It could possibly do with a little extra theoretical background, but if you are looking at any sort of task involving lex and yacc or their derivatives, buy this excellent book.
0	ok, but there is a better LEX/YACC book: To keep it simple, the book "Introduction to Compiler Construction in UNIX" introduces and explains LEX/YACC far better than this book. It uses a more realistic example and shows the error handling in more detail. This book is ok for a quick intro, but for a 'real" user, refer to the book I mentioned above.
1	An Almost Adequate Dvd II: The original Japanese theatrical release is remastered and looks pristine. However, this is not the case with the American English dubbed version. Classic Media should've reconsidered cleaning up the American version as one may want to watch it as an alternative to reading and concentrating on the subtitles.Included on the dvd are features that are welcomed by die hard fans of Godzilla but personally I would've wanted interviews with stars of the film-giving their insights on the movie, experience in filming scenes etc. It especially would've been a treat if they were able to get an exclusive interview with the peanuts.In short, this should be in any Godzilla collection especially for completists.
0	Good movie, but the DVD presentation falls short...: Let it be known that I'm an avid Godzilla fan, and I wanted some DVDs for my new DVD player, so I bought this DVD. Boy, was I disappointed! There's really only 3 extras on the DVD--interactive menus with scene selection, a Destroy All Monsters Game Cube promo, and audio set-up options (english mono and 5.1 Surround sound). The 5.1 Surround sound echoes and sounds unbarable. Options to change the language to Japanese, and add/remove subtitles would've been nice, as I don't care for dubs. The picture's quality is really bad--there's scratches, and what not, making it seem like a bad video transfer. Still, the promo's pretty cool, the animated intro by Mothra's kinda neat. Overall, this DVD is worth picking up only if you can't get a hold of Simitar's superior version.
0	Wannabe Beatles: It seems that they have always tried to be like The Beatles in everyway of their career. They keep telling everyone they are greater than Jesus - the world only took note when The Beatles said it. This album is REALLY disappointing and shows the weak(est?) side of Oasis...great sound when snapped.
1	Admitted Oasis fan says "Go buy this CD!": Okay, so I've always been an Oasis fan. So what? True, Definitely Mabye and What's the Story are their best CDs. So what?These guys are good and know how to make music. Some people hate the Beatles comparison, but I really do think it is appropriate. While maybe not as inventive as the Beatles, their harmonies, lyrics and music are outstanding. Their songs tend to grow on you with repeated listenings. Their CDs tend to be strong all the way through.This is an outstanding CD highlighted by some very good tracks. Fxxkin' in the Bushes (while I hate the title and "lyrics") is bold and bouncy. Go Let It Out, Put Yer Money Where Yer Mouth Is and Gas Panic are all terrific songs. The rest are "just" good.
1	Classic Oasis is back: This album to me far out weighs Be Here Now and to consider the kind of mainstream music out there now, with this album Rock N roll is hopefully back! Great songs on this album include the spiritual Who Feels Love? The timeless Gas Panic? and the sure to be Oasis classic Roll It Over! A special album indeed. Especially if your a fan of the Beatles White Album.
0	Damn, this one was way too boring.: Ya thought What's the story was a stupid cd, think again. This cd takes the cake as the most stupid cd this year has released. I hate Oasis and it's arrogance. I hate every cd they've ever released. I'm glad I've only bought 2. Stay away!
0	Oh come, have some imagination people....: Oasis were never really the most talented or imaginative band, but they wrote good pop songs that made sense 5 years ago. But this? It's overblown, uninspired MOR rock. Why buy this imitation when you can buy the real thing, or, shock horror, something new and imaganitive (check out Primal Scream...)
0	Where's Liam?: I'm a big Oasis fan. I was one of those few people who actually thought "Be Here Now" was brilliant, but this stinks. Only "Go Let it Out" even sounds like Oasis, the rest of the stuff is downright odd, and usually bad. Liam isn't even on 3 of the10 songs, and, unfortunately, those are 3 that actually show some promise. But, without Liam, they sound flat and lifeless. If you want to hear just how bad a song Oasis can make, just listen to "Little James" it must be some sort of inside joke, beacuse it is truly horrible. Buy the single, but leave the album alone.
1	Oasis is finally back!: Oasis is probably one of my fave rock groups ever. I've been waiting for a long time for this album to come out since The Masterplan. SOTSOG is great! I think I got the explicit version (it has two red X's, not that sign). The songs are great. I don't understand why people don't like this disc. It's different than their other ones. They don't have that Beatles sound really anymore. Well, it's not as distinct. If you love Oasis as much as I do, go get it! You won't be disappointed!
0	what a waist of time: Who would have thought, that with such a "great" list of actors & actresses that this movie would be so bad. The scrip must have been written by a foul mouthed teenager as it had no depth and no direction & every other word was a swear word. Do people really talk like that? Not were I live and thank goodness. YUK
0	Boring Movie: What a disappointment this movie was. It had really good actors but it was slow, uninteresting, and just a waste of time.
0	Bad language alert: When a movie gives Jesus the F word as a middle name I can't watch it and it is all over for me.
0	Then she found me.: Hard language was not expected! The F bomb is dropped including,"Jesus F'ing Christ." This is unacceptable. Not for families. Otherwise it was fair.
0	helen hunt is like a piano with one key: From the beginning of the movie, to about three-quarters of the way through, when I ejected it--I kept telling myself "it's got to get better"--it never did. There wasn't a single character that "grabbed me"--and at least two that finally caused me to push the eject button.Does Helen Hunt ever play a role where the audience isn't glaringly aware that it's Helen Hunt on the screen? She whines and chews her way through every line of dialogue until the hair on my arms stands on end. She never deviates: A Good Woman and Then She Found Me--these are very different movies--you'd think she'd do something different with the characters (to fit the time and the place in which the story takes place). I've made a pact with myself--no more movies with Ms. Hunt. This one was the last.
1	Kind of Slow but Good Story: Watched this with my mom and four aunts. Totally a chick-flick. Good story, worth watching. Any movie with Colin Firth is! right?
0	Bette Midler Saved This Movie From A One Star: This movie started slow and an hour into it I found myself waiting for something interesting to happen, by that time I felt I had so much time invested I may as well watch the rest. What torture. Horrible movie with disfunctional characters that behave like fools. Then finally Bette walked in and saved the day, she didn't have any great script to rely on though. Helen Hunt and Matthew Broderick don't have any chemistry and they're not believable as a couple so when things get rocky in their marriage you find yourself rooting for the break up. Helen's more believable with Colin Firth but her role makes her out to be an idiot. There's nothing interesting about this movie, not even the setting. I'm a huge Colin Firth and Bette Midler fan and their roles here are forgettable.
0	Where's the comedy?: The bright spot in this movie was Bette M. I don't understand how an actor of Firth's calibre could waste his talents by appearing in this drivel. To characterize this movie as a comedy is a total misleading fib. Nothing like the book!
0	utter tripe: this book is down there with linux unleashed. It tries to cover every linux topic under the sun, while subtly missing everything useful about every topic.this book should be completely avoided at all costs. the authors (I can't imagine how it took two to write) have just gleaned information from the intros in every howto.get the howtos. if you want it in hardcopy, get a printer. or get the latest linux bible.actually, I would have given this book0 stars if that was an option.
0	Imports are silly/don't buy it.: Sorry, but one of only two good songs on the 'Eat Me, Drink Me' album are found right here. Yes, "Heart Shape Glasses" is a cool tune...but the other sing isn't worth spit..anyway it's presented. Actually, despite the fact that Marilyn manson has established himself as one of the most meaningful songwriters in Rock History, there is no evidence of that on this horribly rediculous album (Eat me Drink Me). All I can say, is that if your looking for a rip off of My Chemichal Romance, HIM, Modest Mouse...you found it. Manson is still a legend...but this whole concept is his least interesting album to date.
0	Awful: This book is horrible. Written as if the person reading it chews rubber-bands and drinks glue for entertainment. Avoid any class using this book. Would give .10 star if possible.
0	Hair: Its Power and Meaning....: An awful atrocity of the literary genre. It was like the personal notebooks of various authors compiled into an uneven mess. Too many articles, too many footnotes & references to page numbers of other books, too little of pictures. Too many irrelevant points of view. I did not enjoy it. It's only a few hundred pages and is entirely black & white, and it was way to high-priced. Like $24.00. If you're looking for any meaning or pictures of the wonderful & elaborate hair dos of Asia, you will find no information in this horrible book.
0	Where's the heat?: This one's going back to the store. It has been turned on for almost half an hour and I barely feel the heat. If you ask me, my feet in some thick socks would produce the same amount of heat. As for the "massage", it's worthless to me, but I am not one for vibrating massage anyway, I prefer shiatsu. I get cold feet when I am home and not moving around a lot, so I think I will stick to wrapping my electric throw blanket around my cold feet!
0	This Book Doesn't Deliver: I bought this book after it was rated one of the top ten real estate books of the year in the Los Angeles Times real estate section. Boy, was I disappointed. This book didn't come close to living up to its promises. The author gave too much information and not enough direction for the typical layperson. He explains the reasons behind all the fees that are attached to loans, but does little to explain how to avoid or reduce them. He describes the different types of loans available, but doesn't really tell you why you should choose one over another. This book was a mostly a waste of time. You are better off reading the section about mortgages in Home Buying For Dummies and finding yourself a good mortgage broker.
0	Lacks detail in Backup & Recovery Section: I used this book (Exam Cram - Test 3 & Test 4 for OCP) and the Jason Couchman (Oracle Press) DBA Exam Guide (the one that's over1000 pages in length) to review recently for the Backup & Recovery Exam for the Oracle Certified Professional Track. This book's section on Backup and Recovery really wasn't adequate in my opinion to pass the test. It did provide a very good general overview, but one really needed the Couchman book to get the level of detail sufficient to answer some of the questions on the certification exam. I did pass, however, but do feel that this book alone would not have sufficed as the single resource to study for the exam. I cannot vouch for the Tuning section of the book (Exam 4 in the series), because I have not read that section at all.
1	EXCELLENT: Excellent at removing small scratches from auto finish without damaging the paint. I have used this for years and found nothing better.
0	bleah: Schlock Rock, Cock Rock.....whatever you want to call it. I'm just glad those days and those types of bands are gone. Brad Gillis was a douch bag!
0	Only good if you know the program: This book is a good reference but not for those who are not proficient already in MAX. As others have stated, the examples often skip steps, assume knowledge of the workings of the program and show "this is what you should end up with" pictures that don't relate at all to what the instructions give. I get the impression also that each chapter was written by a different person because they cover material that has sometimes been discussed or later chapters cover basic material that was left out at the beginning. If you are beginner, don't buy this.
0	the pill splittter did not work at all well the most important medication I needed to split (Coumadin): the Deluxe Pill Splitter By Apex Healthcare did not work WELL at all FOR the most important medication I needed to split (Coumadin). I am very disappointed in it. Can you send me a return authorization and replace the splitter with another more suitable one?
1	Boxes, Boxes and More Boxes, Oh My!: Mom's moving to another stated and needed a tape dispenser that would be hassle free allowing her to zip through taping up packages quickly. This worked. Every time we spoke over the tele, she raved about it.
1	Great Book: Easy to follow instructions. Every recipe I tried was a success. The lack of pictures is a minus. I strongly recommend it
0	Publisher's Dream: It is fairly obvious that the publisher is going to milk this series for all its worth.There are indications that a number of writers/editors may be involved with writing for the series.Nothing at all wrong with this, if you enjoy the kind of pulp output developed in the 40's and 50's and carried through to this series.My Advice: Wait until you see the Blockbuster Promotion which says that this is the last one: finally the Last Battle will be fought and...have some sort of result, which will spawn the next series.And the publishers will enjoy your moneyShannon O'Hara
0	A long series made seemingly endless with this book: I began reading the series better than 6 years ago not knowing it was going to turn into a lifelong pursuit. Lord of Chaos, along with the preceding two books, suddenly began to drag. It's as if Robert Jordan only has 5 books worth of quality writing to put into this series but is under contract to put it into10.I've been reading Chaos since it was released on paperback (who knows how long ago that has been) and I've yet to finish it. Will I? Probably, but only because I've invested too much time in reading the previous 5 and I'm curious to find out how this whole thing ends.My only hope is that the remaining books pick up the pace somewhat and eliminate a lot of unneccesary bland page filler.
1	Lord of Chaos: This book is my personal favorite so far in the series. It had many pros and a little con. the pros were: the creating of the black tower. the healing nyneave can do. and the last chapter is very good. there is also much much more. the bad sides are there are still long talks between nyneave and elayne. The boring tugging of braids, smoothing of skirts, and icy stares.The last chapter,Dumai's Wells, is my favorite because of the battle there. Over all it was the best so far to my opinion.
1	The definitive exploration of fantasy writing in our time.: Robert Jordan continues his complex tale of Rand , the Dragon Reborn, a man born to save the world and in doing so scorch it beyond recognition. In this book, Rand continues his struggle against waiting maddness and ever more determined foes, while the Dark One begins seeding the land with chaos. A must Read!!
0	This book may just make me quit reading this whole series: I can't believe the number of good reviews I've seen on this book. This volume advances the plot by so little, it could have been done in100 pages or less. And I'm sure I'm not the only one who's getting sick and tired of the endless bantering, ranting and raving of the women in the book (especially Nynaeve). It seems like Mr. Jordan is determined to just make all of the female characters in the book look like fools (he's doing a great job so far). I had originally thought that this series was going to end at 8 books, but now I'm not so sure. It seems that Jordan is just going to drag this series out for as long as it takes. The writing is getting worse, the situations are getting less interesting, and it seems that he's writing to an audience of12-year-old boys.
0	Never ending: I acutally spoke to Robert Jordan at a book signing at the time this book came out. At that point I asked him:"how many books there were going to be in the series?" 7 to 9 he says, not quite sure yet."about the plot - do you have it worked out?" Making it up as I go.My heart sank when I got these answers and it probably explains why the series has got so bad from this point onwards. I stopped reading this series when I heard these answers, because I knew it wasn't going to end up well plotted out and was just drifting on and on.This may explain a few mysteries as to why this series has declined in quality so badly. He's got 2 stars because the books were still readable at this time - but there was/is no end in sight still.
0	Great book, wrong Cover: This is a great book (5 star content), however, the kindle edition does not have the new redesigned cover (reason for1 star rating). I really hope this gets fixed soon. The new covers are the only reason I am purchasing these books on the kindle. All the other WOT books I have purchased for the Kindle have the nice redesigned cover. If you want to know what the cover should look like (from the Tor Website): [...]
0	Yawn....: ....when I had trouble sleeping at night...all I had to do was pick this book up and I'd be passed out within15 minutes. I've read the first six books of this series, and this one by far, was the most difficult to get into and finish. The only character who seemed to grow and mature was Egwene. Perhaps it is time for me to go to another author/series...any suggestions?
1	I don't understand people: I really don't understand the mindset that would say this isn't a good book. It was spellbinding. There is character development. You care whether most of the characters live or die. There is ample development of the storyline and you feel a move to the end of the series especially with the massive developments of the end. It may not be great literature (but then it may be), but it is a fun read that doesn't seem nearly as long as it is.
1	Excellent purchase!: I was not willing to spend the $700 for Toyota to put the towing kit on my vehicle so I picked up the Hopkins adapter and a towing kit off ebay for under $200. Installed all in under an hour, works well with my camper!
1	Great Product, Great Customer Service!: I purchased this adapter (47185) at Walmart. It is ruggedly consructed and easy to install and works great. The real reason for my review is to commend the customer service at Hopkins Mfg. Some how I misplaced the mounting bracket that came with the adapter when I was working on the wiring and drilling mounting holes. I called Hopkins to buy another bracket... they said they will send me one for free, and 36 hours later it was at my door! Thanks Hopkins.
1	"Dave" video series: My son LOVES all these videos! I think the guy "Dave" is a little corny but he does do an amazing job showing kids all the trucks, etc. Very recommended- my daughter watches them also.
0	This book is complicate and ugly: This book starts with "What is PL/SQL?". But through the following 900 pages, I could not find a simple example showing how to test run a simple PL/SQL code or procedure through Oracle sqlplus or other Oracle calling interface, such as OCI and Proc. Well, my rating above might be biased. I made a career change from physics to become a professional C/C++ programmer by reading K&R's C Programming Language to begin with. However, I do not feel reading this book alone can get me anywhere but waste all my time. If five stars for K&R's, one star is all for this book. It's a matter of Simple and Beautiful vs Complicate and Ugly.
0	Not a reference book: This book is useless as reference it doesnt fully describe basic functions like to_number. author waste pages on style which is useless to experienced programmers. waste of money
1	God's love, it's an awesome thing: Wow, what a wonderful book. Kendra has put into words, what love is and how love works. Not only does she allow us to learn about wordly love, but she has given us the advantage of knowing about the greatest love of all, God's love. If you have no idea has to how God's love works, this is the book for you.
0	Not quite the Originals: Beware, these songs sound a bit remixed, and are not the original sounding radio hit singles. Usually .89 cent songs are a red-flag.
0	Don't bother ordering these: The listing picture is not representative of the product. It is made out of hard plastic, and it is thick. The result is that it extends into the wheel well by about an inch!Because of the photo, I was expecting something that fits tight against the back of the wheel well and wraps around the body a little bit. I was surprised to see that this mounts against the back of the well but extends so far into the wheel well.
0	Bought for Mercedes: I thought these looked like decent rock guards. I'll probably give these away if anyone will even take them. I'll be buying something off the self from a department or auto parts store for less money that will be more durable.
1	Ray Ban Sunglasses: I absolutely love these sunglasses. These were a replacement for a pair I lost while swimming in a lake. The originals were actually a little too big. This is why I lost them. Ordering through Amazon, I was able to get a pair just like the originals that fit and at a better price. Can't beat that!
0	Confused look at ATL: While I respect the authors as programmers since this book does contain some valuable information, they have no business writing books. This book spends all of its effort discussing how COM works and then how ATL was implemented and provides little insight on how to actually use ATL. After reading this book I was very discouraged from using ATL. Few things are adequately explained. I wonder who the target audience for this book is? It is certainly not ActiveX developers. The second half of the book is superior to the first half. Inside COM, by Rogerson, puts Inside ATL to shame.
0	There are better books than this: I was looking forward to this book for several months. It was supposed to be released originally Oct. '98, but the release date kept getting later and later. I really thought once it did come out it would be a good book. Boy was I wrong. I would recommend trying a different book if you want to learn or use ATL.
1	We love it, however, . . .: We truly love the Canon PIXMA mini260 Photo Printer. The quality of the photos is sharper, clearer and has brighter color than those we saw that were printed on the HP 712 photo printer.However, it would be very nice if the Canon PIXMA had 2 to 4 Gig of internal memory. Also it does not directly receive our Olypus XD photo flash card. This means buying an adapter to insert the card into in order to feed photos directly into the printer or downloading the files from the card onto the computer hard drive and then into the printer. It is not a problem as long as you have any flash card other than the XD.The adapters are a little hard to find locally. They'er avaliable on the net.All in all - the quality of the photos makes up for the file download hassle.
1	Simple - It's good to be me!: The one who loves Gene Simmons or Kiss will love this - Gene is crazy - but perfect and this is why we love these DVDs. We bought the1st two packages so it was clear to us - to also buy No. 3. In germany you are not able to buy these packages and in TV you will always get a translated version - that's boring.
0	Another fake reality show: This show is entertaining, but it annoys me that a show that is meant to be a reality show is fake. I didn't know how fake it was until I watched the episode "Gene Down Under". The entire episode involving Gene buying a football team is fake, none of that happened in real life.I wish this show was more reality than "scripted reality".
0	One of the least useful I've encountered!: I find this set to be next to useless. The Italian on it is so very basic that it's an insult to anyone who has already made any effort at all to learn the language. For all its faults, I find the Michel Thomas set much more helpful - ditto for the Berlitz Intermediate Italian. I concur that the CD's have (even as "brand new" ones) places where the skipping / data flaws are terrible and there is too much dead air on them. Don't waste your money. There are better courses that don't insult your intelligence, and that also use Native speakers (if this is important to you).
0	ELP Goes POP - Lets Us All Down.: I am a lifelong fan of ELP. My favorites are WORKS and Trilogy and the Self-Titled CD but overall, I believe there is something awesome in every ELP album. Except this one. This was the only ELP CD that I did not yet own because I was scared to buy it. Now that I have purchased it I am at a loss for words.This is not the ELP that I remember. This is an attrocity. So I did some reading up on the subject and I found out that this album was basically belched out in order to fulfill a contractual obligation. Don't expect any of the same energy you're used to from ELP. Clearly, their hearts are not in it with this one. It has a rushed feel and there is nothing impressive here.I am sorry. I really wanted to give a better review than that because they are my all time favorite band. But I cannot.-(V)az
0	C++? I don't think so!: The caption on the front of this book says: "Provides a concise, comprehensive guide to the ways ADO 2.0 can be used in all kinds of applications. Demonstrates ADO using VB, C++, J++ and scripting languages with ASP."I have no issue with the first sentence. The second sentence, however, is a blatant lie. I think Wrox should be ashamed of themselves. There are a combined total of less than a page of things referencing C++ in here. If you're going to claim something, maybe you should make sure you actually deliver. This is pathetic.I, for one, am not planning on buying any more Wrox books in the future.Tom McKearney tmckearn@hotmail.com
1	Very good book: I truly enjoyed the book. Very interesting story line and very thought provoking. Well written and I couldn't put it down.
0	too far fetched: Find something else to read. This is not believable. I did want to get to the end of the story but I became impatient with the middle.
1	LOVED IT TO THE END...: This is my third Picoult novel and I have the fourth ready to start. I was riveted by this book and stayed up until 6:00 a.m. 2 nights in a row to get it finished. I LOVED it until the final paragraph. Then she lost me. I still give it 4 stars because she's an awesome writer, but I just didn't "get" the final scene. Maybe I'm dense, but I have mulled it over all day and still can't figure out what it all means in the end. Oh, well...I recomend Picoult anyway. After reading The Pact and Handle With Care, I ordered Keeping Faith and Nineteen Minutes and will probably read her entire collection. She is a wonderful writer and I'm happy to live in New Hampshire because I recognize a lot of the places she writes about!
1	God, in a new light: Jodi Picoult's book "Keeping Faith" made me think about my own religious beleifs in a new light. It also taught me some things about different faiths that I didn't know. The amount of research that goes into her books is amazing. I highly recommand any book writen by this author.
1	Keeping Faith: Jodi Piccoult is the most amazing author! Her in depth research and portrayal of controversial subjects is astounding. Every one of her books seems as if she's telling her own story. Great read!
1	Keeping Faith: I love this book, well written and kept me reading till the very end. Totally recommend it!!!
1	Excellent book!!: Fabulous book really made me think a bit different than other books by Ms. Picoult, but just as captivating! Highly recommend!
1	so wonderful: wonderful writing, intriguing characters, and a unique story line that is pleasantly unpredictable. this was another stellar book by picoult.
1	always enjoy her books: Jodi's books are predictable (drama + court case) but I always enjoy her writing and find I always learn something new.
1	a nice surprise!: I have been reading Jodi's books wayyyyy before she became so mainstream. I never bought this book though because the topic seemed really iffy to me. I just didn't see how she could pull off this topic and make it into a good book. After getting her newsletter though and seeing one of the characters would be in her new book, Change of Heart, I decided it was time to read it. I must say I'm so happy I did. As a Catholic I found it especially interesting. Don't let the topic fool you though like it did me. There is a lot of religion but underneath that is a great plot and story line. Really enjoyable!
1	Keeping Faith: This is an unusual book, but it sure keep your attention. This story kept my attention throughout the entire book.
1	keeping faith: An easy read with a good story line...keeps you guess til the end! If you a Jody Picoult fan you will enjoy this1
0	Not a page turner: I had to read this book for a book club and that is the only reason why I finished reading it. It dragged on and on and on- a lot of fluff with religion thrown in. I can see how someone could see the "deeper message," but the book was boring. And for 400 pages, it is almost a waste of time. Maybe if the book was half the size I would have somewhat enjoyed it and given it 3.5 stars.
0	You have to like the heroine and I didn't: My title is basically my review. I didn't like Charlene. There are strong women and then there are self absorbed whiny people, Charlene fits the latter. Why the author describes Dennis as being loyal and wonderful is beyond me. He didn't have the gumption to break off his "engagement" before he starts an affair with the wedding coordinator. Charlene needs some snappy dialog and some female friends to get her on the right track but then that would be a Jennifer Crusie novel.....the premise for this book showed promise it just wasn't well executed.
1	Great Book for Learning about TCP/IP !: I found TCP/IP JumpStart very helpful on a topic that is new to me. Computer networking field is a new topic that adds dimension to my portfolio. Andrew Blank has a wonderful way of teaching so a novice can understand yet an intermediate doesn't get bored. He brings examples and illustrations to the text enabling you to understand or actually visualize the technology concept. TCP/IP JumpStart brings technology into terms for beginners, also more advanced students can collect new ideas and concepts. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is about to take a class or would like to learn about TCP/IP. This is a book that I can highly recommend to anyone.
1	A collection of one of the best comedies ever: This collection of all12 episodes of Fawlty Towers is great! It is a nicely packaged 3-disc set and the episodes are all classic and gut-bustingly hilarious. I highly recommend purchasing this complete set.
0	Fawlty Towers - The Complete Series, DVD: The Fawlty Towers episodes are hilarious and deserve their growing cult status. However, this DVD set is poor quality and not recommended. The problem is the compression used in order to fit the series on three DVDs: the frame-rate has been significantly reduced. This would be mostly unnoticeable on a slow moving film, but there is considerable amounts of fast movement in Fawlty Towers, so the result is a very distracting, jerky effect where actors magically jump from one position to the next. There is also a graining quality to the image that suggests other types of compression. What's the point of a DVD when the VHS delivers better viewing?
1	Classic Cleese: It's such a shame only12 episodes were made...This is great English comedy... in fact great universal comedy..I loved it... John Cleese is a Genius.
1	Laughter is the best medicine: My wife and I watch Fawlty Towers on Saturday nights as a relief from the negative media barrage. The episodes have never let us down, and we hee-haw all evening. We love to watch them over and over. Great movies, those British sit-coms.
0	overRated!: I'm sorry, but Fawlty Towers was at best a mindless sitcom. Characterization, plot, and even setting were a bare minimun as Cleese mugged his way to cheap laughs. It's funny for about three minutes and after that the same joke over and over just gets tired.
1	Fawlty not Farty: I love BBC comedy & this was a great addition to my collection - FUNNY! I can just play it for great background slapstick when I'm piddling around the house even...
1	BUY THIS TODAY!!: I'm a stickler when it comes to comedy-especially tv comedy. When I saw this series back in the 70's I laughed very hard. Now that it's on DVD complete with all12 episodes, I put the discs in, kicked back and laughed even harder. It didn't help that I had a slight cold-I could barely breathe and my ribs started hurting after watching the first disc. I then proceeded to watch the other two discs. I was in bad shape by the time I was finished but I didn't care. These old episodes are hilarious. This is the way tv comedy should be!!
1	A must have.: Although dated sets detract somewhat the overall effect is splendid. A must have in any collection.
0	dissapointing!: only good song was lyla and even that was no good, im onna pre order the new offspring album instead!
1	Oasis rockin'!: This album many not blow you away on the first listen, but it could easily grow on you! It's definitely better than Heathen Chemistry, and may be the band's best album since Morning Glory! It sounds slightly different from any other Oasis albums, but it's still something that Oasis fans should appreciate. If you hate Oasis, then you won't like this album, but if you're an Oasis fan, then I definitely recommend this album for you!
1	Oasis are generally good.: Really, it is hard to go wrong with an Oasis record. They always have some good lyrics hovering over some good rock music. To me, none of their albums, with maybe the exception of "What's the Story" are really totally great and timeless, but overall, it is good rock music.
0	Waste of paper. waste of plastic, and a waste of paper.: Thankyou Oasis but no thankyou, your time is well and trully up, at the moment anyway.Your album don't "Beleive the nonsensical lies and dishonesty towards all who like good music and are fans of Oasis" is a dissapointment worthy of rating in itself, funnily enough it gets nice well rounded one star.The album has "NO" direction and "NO" purpose, sounding more or less, no more like Oasis take on1960s rock n roll, which of course has been, been and down and has its place in time, but now I think its time to move on and do something new thankyou very much and givin the "DISGUSTING" state of new and older bands at the moment (beleive it or not) it was up to you to shine the light. That ended after your great album "Heathen Chemistry" so thankyou but no thankyou.
0	Modern Oasis is Rubbish: The one star is for Liam's hair on the inside cover. At least that still has it's dignity.As for the music, I believe they have finally lost their touch.The Importance of Being Idle, Part of the Queue, and Let There Be Love are mediocre. Unfortunately, all of the other tracks are completely unlistenable.It's sad that a band who was once so great are putting out this kind of trash, but luckily for their fans, they let us down slowly with Standing On The Shoulders Of Giants and Heathen Chemistry - so at least it didn't come as a big surprise.
1	Love it even more!!!!: Again, i just marvel in the risks these men and women take every time they get in a big rig! I love to watch the drama they face every day. It is very entertaining as well! I hope they come out with more and more episodes every year! I will look forward to seeing them every weekend!
0	Could be so much better: Housing is made very well, has a nice weight to it, but that does not apply to the base of the button which is made of plastic. If installed on an uneven surface or flashing that bends, the notch and a tab on the base do not snap together as they should. A redesign of the unit that eliminated the troublesome base would make this a very nice doorbell button.
0	Died... On a self-destruct logic board: Until the logic board went and self-destructed, it was doing well. I am very upset with Canon and its short-lived circuitry.
0	Refurbished but not tested?: I received the printer with a broken ink cartridge in the box, that should have been the first clue. Printer would not get past the set up returning an error about the "scan lock". Makes me wonder if they actually tested the printer before sending it back out again. If it hadn't been for the easy return policy I would have been very upset. Ended up buying a brand new Canon MP610 and had it up and running in a few minutes, very happy with it.
0	Digital "remastering" is horrible: This CD does not do Mr. Rifkin justice at all. It sounds like a cheap "MIDI" version of Rikin's playing - like a cheap $50 electric keyboard. Gone are the acoustic sound that can be heard on the concert grand that Rifkin's original recordings are played on. You're better off buying the "UN-mastered" original CD from Nonesuch Records. This is an insult to one of the greatest Joplin interpreters.
0	Not worth the money: Don't publishers proof read these books anymore? Numerous mistakes throughout the book including in the review questions. This book also does not cover things on the exam such as Compatibility settings. It seems as though the author just took the exam topics and wrote something that he thought was important, but not what Microsoft tested. Interestingly, one of the appendices contained test strategies that MS uses on the exams. Unfortunately the questions asked in the review exercises for the most part did not follow these guidelines.
0	Not a well written book: Book is one of the most boring I have ever tried to read. I read many travel books but this one is awful.
1	Cassette? This is 2010. Where's the CD Version: I just want to say that this is my favorite book of all time. The writing of William Least-Heat Moon is filled with wonder. I give it a10 out of10!!!However this is 2010 and I still find it strange that Audiobooks; for the most part are only available on Cassette. Heck, I don't even own a cassette machine anymore. I wish the companies would start putting these out on CD.Steinbeck's Travels with Charley is available on CD. My second favorite book.Again the book is one that HAS to be in your collection. I have probably read it over a dozen times and I always find something new.CD version please.
1	Wonderful for the whole family: Little Britches is a fantastic book. It takes the reader back to early1900 Colorado and a family who loved each other and worked very hard as they struggle to build their ranch. This is the first book in a series and once you start reading you won't want to stop. Ralph (Little Britches) learns a lot of life's lessons the hard way. His father's parenting skills gently lead Ralph to make the right choices. There are horses, cowboys, and a water rights fued that provide excitement as well as many warm family moments.
1	Pretty good reading: The writing style was simple; The storyline was engaging, the characters captivating. The story was narrated unsentimentally, but effects sympathy.However, this book contains profanity, besides mild violence and unwarranted reference to bodily function.
0	Absolute trash ...: I bought the first edition of this book - which was about 700 pages;It cost me $44.95 - and the book was not worth a penny! I believe the 2nd edition is better - because it has some extra pages and these last few pages are supposed to be better! I find that hard to believe ... The authors do not know how to write a technical book - they are belligerent! The book wanders all over the place - no details at all - or none of any consequence! If the publishers had any conscience they would send me the last section of the new edition FOR FREE! This was one of the worst computer books that I have ever run across ... AVOID other books by these authors!
0	Heavy Paperweight: This book starts strong, then becomes a sad use of dead trees. There are a number of good examples on the uses of XML, but many overlap and become repetitive. The previous comment on poor editing is well founded...the number of blantant printing and typographical errors is astounding.
0	Where is the real content?: I purchased this book on the strength that it was written by the creater of SGML so I figured 'how bad can it be?' Well I found out exactly how bad. This book fails to explain anything thouroughly, and whilst the first few chapters are fairly light and humourous, the middle section descends into needless and unjustified haranging of other fine technologies such as CORBA and seems to be one big advert for Microsoft and associates. Some of the information is just plain wrong, whilst other parts simply are badly explained. If your company is starting to try to avoid microsoft products as ours is, STAY AWAY! Boy I wish I had read the reviews before I bought this book from a bookshelf in a store. I could have saved myself alot of time and money.
0	WORST book I have come across in a LONG time....: This is a seriously awful book. It is without doubt the ugliest most badly designed book I have ever seen. Much worse it is badly written, sheds little light on the subject matter, and even more heinous, it is purports to be unbiased technical book, but mostly consists of blatantly biased chapters "sponsored" by Microsoft and others. I have just finished Chapter 6, "sponsored" by Microsoft and you would swear that IE was the only browser in the world, their implementation of DHTML the only one in the world, and there were no scripting languages/methodologies but VBScript and ASP. The writer did not have the PROFESSIONAL DECENCY to give a balanced overview of the subject matter, just tried to push MS products. SHAME SHAME SHAME on everyone involved in this terrible book. I am only giving it one star because the form won't accept anything less.
0	Where are the examples?????: For the money I shelled out for this book, I expected to be able to see some fairly decent examples of how to1. Write the XML code and 2. Use what I've written. Admittedly, I did skim through the book, but I figured, "Hey, it's the guy who wrote the SGML spec - can't be too bad, must've just missed something. I'll catch it when I read the book."Well, I haven't found it yet... still looking...nope, not there.I am very disappointed...And what the heck is a "chapter sponsor" or a book sponsor, anyway? If you've got sponsors, I should be able to get the book a wholoe lot cheaper.What a waste of money.
0	Useless: An absolutely useless source for information on xml. The examples were not clear or useful, and the writing was too pretentious to read. I would not recommend this book, or any of the others in this series (i have read the others also- searching for something applicable).
0	Advertising in a tech book?: One of the strangest books I have seen and a very disturbing trend. The authors sold corporate sponsorship of chapters and let each company write an chapter-length ad. Its bad enough to get ads at movie theaters and on rental videos, but in a technical book? It's one thing to have ads in things where the cost is largely underwritten by the ads (like magazines), but its quite another to find 25% of a full-priced book filled with ads. Buying this book will only help to standardize this practice. Send the publishing industry a message by refusing to buy this book.As many other readers point out, this book is aimed at managers who could buy the products sold by the companies who bought chapter ads.
1	Excellent book! Well written and full of great information.: This book is an excellent choice for learning about XML and the technologies (both new and old) that are utilizing or planning on utilizing XML. This book has something for everyone in the XML world, both novices and experts.
1	Great XML Overview: Just wanted to say that this is a great book especially if you like "real" XML implementation examples. If you want an overview of what XML can do for you go get this book.
1	Good transaction: Product arrived quickly, in perfect condition and was exactly as described. No problems with vendor. Very happy with product and transaction.
1	Abduction to the Ninth Planet: I am blown away by this book, and what the author describes he was shown during his trip. His account confirms living in lower gravity, in harmony and love, the way of living, all serving one intention without monetary system, the dwelling places, Earth politics compared to true governing, the history of our planet, so much of what many of us have seen ourselves. The loving light energy he describes is very real. I bless and thank Michel for publishing his report. Read it, you will love it, it will open your eyes!
0	Doesn't work with itouch: no wonder it was only [...] bucks, now that I look closer I see the ipod touch isn't supported, but wtf, it says it "works will all 'docking ipods'"I have an ipod touch, it docks, but apparently that's not a "docking ipod."Total waste of money! =/
1	SPITTING NEARLY: I,D LISTNING AND READING ABOUT SNCE1976,BUT UNDERSTANDING ALOT I THINK THE FUNNY PARTS ARE THE BEST,BUT AS WE SAY HERE IN N-NORWAY :IF WE DIDNT`HAVE THE HUMOR WHAT DO WE HAVA???
1	Enjoyable BUT....: I thoroughly enjoyed this book but, if you are looking for details and insight from "the man himself" re: Frank Zappa's extensive body of recorded works, then you will be sorely dissapointed.The first chunk of the book is mostly about his childhood and the last half or so is devoted to barbed essays on a miscellany of dis-jointed topics such as politics, raising a family, inventions that Zappa couldn't get funded, etc. In the middle you get a smattering of chronology describing the formation and first few years run of the original Mothers of Invention... Zappa's musical exploits through the 70's and 80's is nearly completely ignored!!, ...Instead of devoting numerous pages to tedious diatribes concerning the PMRC Music Labelling initiative, (which now seems like a historical "non-issue"), I would have far preferred to have read an album-by-album review by Zappa offering insight into each of the tracks and any related anecdotes behind their creation.
0	Coming out story made by straight people: At first I was gonna give it 3 stars. But after I had read some other reviews (I didn't have a chance to watch additional comments on dvd), I stopped at 2.WHy?Here's why:- Coming out story is the base of the plot, innit? Instead of making the relation between Riley and Andy more real, we are treated with scenes full of naked boobs, naked women)...- There is no chemistry between those two gays. P. Jones remains straight during the whole film.- The coming out moment is so fake. Slides? Who came with such lame idea in plot?- Instead of fighting with stereotypes, this film confirms 'em.- Some of the scenes are way too long or out of place- The type of jokes used in the plot is quite simple (farts? playing with dirty language? maybe good for teen comedy, but not for "mature" film)Good coming out story? "BREAKFAST WITH SCOTT", "BALLS"."Outing Riley" it just a poor story made by straight guys who thought they were funny...Shame.
1	Great story, well told: After watching this movie for the second time, I was able to look at it a little more objectively. It was definitely better the second time. It tells the universal story of family and love and acceptance from a gay perspective. That what we're all looking for, isn't it - acceptance? Lots of humor, likeable characters, and realistic relationships made this movie work for me.
0	Worth the price and not a penny more: I paid a ridiculously small amount for this pair of shoes - under $20. With how little I paid for them, they are fine. I would not recommend then at full price. They are not worth $69. There is no discernible arch support, the soles are not padded, and the sides are not supportive.
1	Triumph's Most Consistent: I thought this one was gonna suck and I only bought it because I'm OCD and a completist. However, I was pleasantly surprised by how good this album is. All of Triumph's other albums (except for their first) suffer from some serious filler, but every song was pretty decent on this one. Rik Emmett is gone, but Phil X does an excellent job on guitar and Gil Moore seemed to have stepped up his vocal performance. And as always with Triumph, awesome production.
0	Complete waste of money!!!: I bought this book based on the review I read in InfoWorld. I will have to say that this book provides little more than your IDE's online help. About the only thing this book is good for is kindling for my wood burning stove.
1	R & B Season 5: There are a lot of excellent reviews of this set, to which I cannot add anything better. Rocky and Bullwinkle, along with Bob Clampett's Beanie & Cecil, taught me humor when I was young. Puns, non sequiturs - you name it - it's all here, and done without the potty humor that seems so prevalent today. Thank goodness we are able to enjoy these episodes again today!
1	good reference book: this book of maps would probably be awelcome addition for an experiencedastronomer.....not for a beginningfan of astronomy. Nightwatch wouldbe my recommendation to the later.
0	don't buy the kindle edition: i got the kindle edition and returned it the next day, the offset tables are small and cannot be enlarged so you can actually read them. so save yourself the trouble and get the printed edition. other than that, from what i looked over, it looks like the book has great information in it.
1	Winter boot: Love the boots. Very warm and thick. The boots are "heavy" but it's just want you need in real bad snowy conditions that require good treads. They also fit very snug - but soft & comfortable with the interior padding.
1	Beats of the heart: Amazing music. exellent explanations, not too long just in time.The singing , the druming , the words remind us where the real beating of the heart is coming from.
0	You get what you pay for: It is unfortunate that Guy De M is known in the USA for his short stories. They are well-written and were ground-breaking150 years ago, but they do not age well. This translation is particularly poor and the Dover edition is so cheap and flimsy that the only thing good you can say about it is that it's cheap. And cheap isn't always the best value. For great French short fiction, try Emile Zola. De M's novels are great and age much better than this stuff. Historically they're interesting but have an O. Henry quality that doesn't work much anymore.
1	Cool Watch: Honestly, I have no idea what the buttons or dials do, but this watch looks cool AND tells time. I bought it because it looked alien, but I get compliments on it almost daily. It's big, and showing and gets the right kind of attention.
0	SHM CD version of Trilogy: This review speaks only to the quality of the ultra expensive, Japanese SHM CD version of Trilogy. Look for another version of this c.d.. The hiss that is present during and between songs is unbelievable. It is as bad as listening to an old cassette tape. I am blessed to own the MFSL version which I assume is still the gold standard of this c.d..I purchased this edition on a lark because it was touted that "you won't believe it's the same c.d.". Well, they were right but for the wrong reason. This is a10 star title that deserves better.
0	Not thorough, nor helpful: This books is not as helpful as I expected at all. The structure looks very good, but when I read it, I found none of the topic was explained clearly and thoroughly. For example, adding a user, it only mentioned command adduser without indicating which file that really recorded the user information. Actually, when I installed Linux and set up configuration, I have to look for other help, like Linux online help. This book just added my confusion.
1	WOW!!!!: Que has done it again!! The leader in advanced computer books bring one of the best books for beginning Linux system operators
0	Recipes lack imagination: Nothing different about recipes. I was looking for something that had some other options or ways to use my pressure cooker
1	Cookers for Dummies: I purchased this book with my new pressure cooker. It has some wonderful tips. It gives you an idea of how long to cook beans, soups etc... also shows you how to use your own recipes with a pressure cooker. The practical workings of a pressure cooker are explained to you and that was very helpful as I had never used one before. My experience has been that not all the timings are correct, at least for my altitude. For example if I cook the beans as long as the book says my beans are mushy. But it was a good start and I've learned how to adjust the timing. Over all the book was very helpful.
0	For smart dummies: The book didn't answer a lot of basic questions for me, having never used a pressure cooker. It's O.K. as a supplement to other pressure cooker cookbooks, but I was hoping it would provide more step by step instructions.Very disappointing.
0	Not as good smelling as I thought.: Doesn't smell bad but not as good as I thought. Think I ordered the wrong Mont Blanc fragrance. Husband uses it though.
0	Good for insomnia: Though some of the material is useful, I found these tapes to be long and boring. The authors read the text like a funeral procession. I would much rather recommend any of Anthony Robbins work - which always has some NLP, presented in a passionate, immediately useful way.
0	waste of money: i needed some comments on the linux ip code, the title was right and there was a five stars review by a reader, had no time to wait and so i ordered it by e-commerce. Already accustomed to comments a la R.Stevens was very hopeful What a mistake ! more than 450 pages of linux kernel listings, not only, the listed kernel was 2.0 (at this time the firsts 2.4 are out) !!!! The commentary, all at the end of the listing not very insightful, will never buy another book in this series !
0	It didn't do Lord Soth justice!: The book, Lord Soth, I found to be poorly written and failed to explain and give good reason for Lord Soth's spiral downward into the depths of evil. The way the book was written failed to show the emotions of Soth as he committed his crimes. The author seemed to just skim over the important parts, such as the deaths of Lady Korinne, Isolde, and his two children. Even though any DragonLance novice knows the tale of Soth, this book failed in showing Soth's honour and true evil. Also the summary on the back of the book concerning Soth's quest given to him by Paladine is quite misleading since it lasts a whole chapter at the end of the book. The novel also didn't fully explain what evil magic transformed Soth and his loyal knights into Death Knights. Overall I found the book very uninspired and was disappointed by it. Weis and/or Hickman should have written the book as opposed to some novice.
1	Review of Village Centenary: Miss Read books are lovely stories of the everyday life of a village schoolteacher. They are wholesome, funny and light reading. This particuluar story chronicles a school year where the school is celebrating its100th anniversary. The banter between Miss Read and her school cleaner Mrs. Pringle is wonderfully funny. I love Jan Karon and the Mitford series, these books are as delightful as a visit to Mitford.
1	Good Start for beginers: This is a good start for somebody who never build a PC before, and give you and idea on where to start and what to do. This is a typical "Hows to..." book and I'll recomended it.Michael Da CruzCalifornia
0	out of date: It's a good book but is a few years old so the material is dated. I wouldn't recommend it.
1	Cyclone Featuring the sexy Heather Thomas: here's a Movie from the past.i remember watching this way back in the days.i got it on dvd, and yea the movie is okay, but heather thomas looks great in the movie.
1	In ol' Virginia: Basically a plotless book that contains a series of sketches depicting life on a Virginia plantation circa1830. The main sketch involves a lawsuit over disputed land, which leads to comedy and romance. Kennedy is a skillful writer and offers up a charming picture of what life was like then. His style is light and fanciful, and one reads the book with a relaxed pleasure.
1	Great first watch: Great first watch if your kid likes pink and hearts. Easy to read, accurate, they'll love the pink backlight. Being waterproof is helpful as kids easily forget to not splash around when washing their hands. Price is good, too, as you won't be too upset if/when they lose it. Of course, the kids probably will, if they notice. Timex even provides a discount replacement because they know the probability of loss is high.
1	Please forgive me: All I have to say is that I bought a Britney record. The end times are surely drawing nigh. I still like the song however. It is her best work yet.
0	Detoxifying.: This is a terrible single for a decent, catchy song. Sonically, the remixes fall flat because they do not really suit the song. If you want a really good remix, download K.O.'s Level 5 Toxicity mix instead of buying this.
0	Jumping here, jumping there: With the exception of 2 or 3 chapters this book is a complete waste of money - too much useless information in a complete messy manner.
1	The feel GREAT docu of 2008: If you're feeling a little dejected about humanity in general , there's some great and positive news for you . Since streaming this absolutely wonderful and totally uplifting film , my wife and i have bought , like , eight copies for friends and family . Other folks will tell you the particulars . This film is soul Prozac . Truly do yourself a favor and check it out . It's for what ails you .
1	This book should not leave your desk...A very good reference: If you are new or have been using Linux or Unix this is a bookfor you desk next to your computer system. This book has been a pleassureto read and use. I am using the book as a teaching guide forfriends, family, and co-workers.This book caontains two cd's with examples to get your system up and runningas fast as possible. The explains on how to get X windows up.X windows is a windows like interface. The verison of Linuxis Slackware. You can partion your for a seprate installmentor run the system from the CD. Done both. You can use LiLo,a boot loader, to boot OS2, Win95, NT 3.51, and 4.0, I haveNT 4.0 on my system.Yes you can do your internet surfing. I use Netscape gold3.0 under Linux, e-mail, newsgroups, ftp, and etc. In fact thisreview is being done using Netscape under Linux.The main problem that I have found is that some of theexamples are printed small. This is good system to programdevelopement on, and networking.
1	Banana Hammok: Want your banana just hanging in the breeze or do you want your banana hanging in style. Well for the stylish hangers this is the display you want. Looks great and is very heavy duty.
1	Not just for bananas, anymore!: I can't believe that I'm writing a 'review' about a banana holder, yet here we are.Anyway, get two. One for your bananas, and another for, say, holding your headphones in a stylish and safe manner at your desk/listening area. This little stand works great and, at [...] is SIGNIFICANTLY less than what audio suppliers like to charge their customers for really basic crap (think of how expensive audio-branded speaker / component stands and the like are). Anyway, there's an idea for ya.I don't even eat bananas, lol.
1	Outstanding director: Daugthers of Darkness is more than a surreal masterpiece.It's an unforgettable experience.But for when on DVD more of Harry Kumel'sfilms, as the eerie Malpertuis? SOS to Amazon to urge who cares for restoring this and other treasures of the seventh art.
0	Save yourself! Don't see this hideous film!: Worse than a merely bad film is a self-important bad film. This monstrosity drips with artsy pretensions, yet is so poorly written, acted and directed that it doesn't even amuse in its badness. By the end of it I felt like a traumatized prisoner.Notes to the director: eerie lighting and bad lighting are two different things. I felt like I needed a flashlight to see what was going on - but then again, maybe the lack of lighting was a small mercy paid us by the director.The screenplay is entirely incoherent, and the actors are absolutely clueless. There's supposed to be some sort of oh-so-erotic lesbian imagery in here, but I've seen better eroticism in the worst European sexploitation films.
1	Amazingly deep for its length: A slim book, only 86 pages. It's the story of a woman who has just lost her father and is dealing with that, and at the same time trying to get pregnant, something she's been struggling with for a long time. A very likable narrator. Fusselman does a great job of conveying emotional depth with very few words.
1	Live and hilarious but missing something.: Hi, all. This is a fantastic piece of comedy of which I laugh all the way through it. I once saw protions of it along time ago and finally got a copy. But, somethings missing! The SCHOOL ROLE CALL. Anybody know of it, and know were I can get hold of it?
0	Cheesy Heroes: My three-year old grandson loves anything to do with firetrucks and firemen, but he didn't like this DVD. It was ridiculous. The two actors were really cheesy and stupid.
1	safer replacement for traditional wax candle: Safer than a traditional wax candle. Gives the same amount of light. I use this on my Nursing Graduation while reciting the Florence Nightingale pledge. Looks nicer on a low light room.
0	Don't last: Batteries don't last very long, a few days at most. I've bought similar lights in the past that would stay lit for weeks.
1	EXCELLENT FLICKERING LED CANDLES!: I bought this12-candle pack for Christmas decor and I'm really satisfied with product quality. Flame effect is life-like, I put on a frosted-glass votive and flickering effect is amazing!!! Uses CR2032 lithium batteries, best battery for LEDs, as we know, LED uses few amperage, not drain your batteries like a conventional bulb, so battery can last for years....I'll buy 4 packs more!
0	This was a disappointment: I found this book to be a disappointment. I was taken aback by the author's decision to summarily exclude some groups because he felt they were insufficiently Christian for inclusion and by his decision to interlace his descriptions of the various denominations he covers with his opinion of the "right answers" in terms of their doctrinal positions.I would recommend the purchase of the most recent edition of Mead's Handbook of Denominations in the United States over this book. It is broader in scope and relates the views of the various groups without the partisan commentary.
1	great book if you want to know the science behind Cryonics: Goes through and explains the science behind cryonics. It disproves what many of the cryonics detractors assert. Over all a good read!
0	Why is Amazon charging for Kindle version of this?: This story is well over 50 years old and in the public domain so why is Amazon charging for the Kindle version of this? It should be free. And it is free - a quick Google search will reveal full text versions that you can read online for free.
0	Where's the 3D?: I watched the whole thing without the glasses - with them it was just dark and not 3D at all. Very disappointed.
0	One boys dream of flying and finding the girl of his dreams: I suppose one of the things I have come to expect about 3D movies is they feature effects that take advantage of the 3D effect. This movie does little of that. This is the story of two young kids, a boy and girl. He dreams of flight, she is a natural engineer. Later in life they are best friends but deal with a military pilot trying to steal her heart. The acting is poor. The photography is mostly amazing.Some of the scenes shot over Lake Powell become tedious with endless stalls and boring close-ups of people in the cockpit. There is very little of what is featured in the case/cover photograph. If you're looking for a Blue Angels in 3D type video, this is not for you. If you're looking for non-actors with lots of actor close-ups generally filmed in 3D than this might be the ticket.I would have rather seen a best-of at Oshkosh in 3D instead. I wish I had never purchased this 'movie.'
0	Ultimate Writer's Cramp: Once again Imax has tried to combine a story with spectacular photography. I would think by know I would have learn my lesson. But you mention the word Imax combine with the Grand Canyon,Lake Powell and aerial photography I took the bait. This story is so simple that it takes away from the film. I feel if you do not have an interesting story to tell why try. Instead of going the educational or thrill route they went with a story that was hard to get through once let alone twice. Why Imax could settle for a plot like this when they are consistently A+ in the photo and sound department is a wonder to me. There standards can be so high on one end and at the bottom of the scale on the other. Imax has produce quite a few good films. But for my money those are films that are educatonal or have thrilling photography. This film has some of the photography but it allso has a story that will put you to sleep.
0	Disappointing Quality and Content: This 3D Blu-ray has the potential to be wonderful, but it falls short. Most of the 3D effect has ghosting throughout most of the video. Its like everything is out of focus. Also, the plot is silly and pointless. Save your money.
0	This is definitely NOT ELP!: ELP should have quit while they ahead with "Black Moon" (1992) and "Live at the Royal Albert Hall" (1993) in terms of their ephemoral 90's comeback. "In the Hot Seat" was just tarnished by quick-fix greed in terms of the quality its tracks are presented in. There isn't a single shred of any timeless ELP instrumental quirks to be found in any of these songs, and the 90's update of "Pictures at an Exhibition" is just plain dolorous! "Hand of Truth", "One By One", and "Daddy" are the only tracks that get the dubious honor of gold, silver, and bronze from me. One last "below the belt" blow on "In the Hot Seat" would be that even under the influence of a12-pack, "Love Beach" (1978) would sound like heavy dynamic make-out music (HAH)!
1	It's Good; Not Sure if "Superfast" is the Word, Though...: I just received this cookbook and was super excited to see some pretty awesome recipes in it. My only question is about the choice of the term "Superfast." To me, a wife that works full time, weekday dinners need to be fast. And, there is a plethora of information out there on fast meals, but most aren't too healthy. I need a combination of both. And, I thought this would be it.But, I think the term fast means something different to me. These are quick, easy recipes for 7PM on a Monday when I get home. These require a lot of additional prep that I wasn't looking for.It will be great for weekends when I have more time, but for weekdays, I continue my search. Looking for the holy grail that is the truly healthy, yet quick, weekday cookbook. The search continues! =)
1	A very good reader: I thought the reader for this book was very good. He did Palpatine's voice especially well. I also felt that the book filled in gaps about character motivations that there wasn't time to cover in the movie. I felt the book enriched my experience of the movie.
0	Where's the witty dialogue?: The thing that hooked me on the Star Wars saga was the incredibly constant bickering and arguing that happens in episodes IV and V: C3PO and R2D2, Han Solo and Leia, Darth Vader and the other Imperial commanders.However, in episodes I, II, and now in III, the dialogue is flat. I was falling asleep while reading the conversations in this book. Episodes I, II and III apparently are nothing more than an attempt to see how many computer-generated droids can be blown up in each movie. What a pity. What a waste of my time.
1	I Envy Lee Pulos: When I pulled several hypnosis books off the library shelf to review, "Beyond Hypnosis" did not quite appeal to me. The cover was unattractive and quite plain. However, an inner-awareness told me to check out the book and to read it. I did so.I enjoyed the book immensely, enough to order a copy for myself! Mr Pulos' book put the hypnosis phenomena into a perspective that allowed me to comprehend and apply the principals to my daily activities. I actually was able to hypnotize myself for a brief period. I envy the author for his intelligence and insight.Between readings, I left the book on my bed. Without prodding, my wife skimmed the book; I knew that she is skeptical about these things. To my surprise, she read the book in its entirety. She said that she could relate to many of the elements in the book. She commented that this was one of the few books from which we both received mutual enlightenment! The book also served as a foundation for further reading on hypnosis.
1	A part of our history, A wonderful movie of all times...: The actors cannot ever be replaced from the original movie. I LOVE this movie more than any other movie I have ever seen, I guess because you can really see a lot of the truth in it. When Scarlett says, I'll worry about it tomorrow, thats her way of dealing with the pain of Rhett leaving. To survive this is the way you must think or else you would go insane. So much emotion involved in this movie. There will never be another "GONE WITH THE WIND"......
1	the reason we have 5 stars: The first epic saga. Vivien Leigh is magnificent and Hattie McDaniel deserved an award. You sure don't need me to tell you about Gone with the Wind. A must for and and all movie buffs.Just wanted to say I'm pleased with the DVD version.
0	i would have rated it higher if only I can watch it: It keeps stopping, I pause it and start it up again the volume doesnt start right away, so you dont know what there saying, I pause it and start it and it keeps saying try again later can't connect, waste of money, won't watch a amazon movie again!!!
1	1.33:1 Ratio: The only thing bothers me is this movie is not a widescreen format.But after careful research, now I know that it was shot originally that way back in1930s.What can I do? Cut the bottom and the top to look like widescreen format?The dvd I have is actually1.85:1. I think they really cut the top and the bottom to look like widescreen alright for the DVD.Perfect movie for sure. No doubt about it.Very food picture quality. Perfect Bluray.
0	Not Wide-Screen Version: Re: "Gone With the Wind" (The Scarlett Edition): Beware. Even though this 3-disc set is Blu-Ray, the movie itself is not widescreen format. I certainly have no desire to pay almost $30.00 to watch an epic film like "Gone With The Wind" as an old square picture (with black on either side of the square imate) on my HD tv. How disappointing. If you want the widescreen version, don't purchase this particular item.
1	This is the greatest movie of the century....: This movie is an epic....and while, true, it does not meticulously keep with the novel, it is still the greatest love story of the cinematic "Hollywood glory days". Vivien Leigh is "Scarlett O'Hara", not only does she fit the description, she just becomes the character heart and soul. And there could absoulutely be no one else who could be Rhett but Clark Gable. The casting is perfect, the sets are so realistic, and the story moves along; even though it is four hours long, the movie just flies by. It is a classic, and should be seen by everyone who loves movies. This is the way movies were meant to be.
1	One of the best movies of all time: I love this movies so much. I forget how many times I have watched it. And every time I watch it gives me new excitement.
1	What? No widescreen? Sacrilege!: I was very disappointed to find my all-time favorite film, GWTW, treated so rudely with the release of this DVD. A film of this caliber deserves better. Though the transfer could have been better, I found it acceptable. The soundtrack was less enjoyable, however. While I realize there is only so much one can do to enhance a fifty-year-old recording, I was surprised at how shrill and tinny-sounding it was. The major disappointments for me were the lack of bonus materials (very cheesy, Warner Bros.), and the non-widescreen format (unforgivable). I certainly hope that Warner will offer upgrade pricing to owners of this version when the inevitable "Special Edition" is released (uh-huh, right)! Happily though, as with all classics, this film is still pure magic!
0	Romantic Racism: You have to give credit to this film for its glossy, epic sweep and the fact that it breaks new ground in filmmaking techniques. Unfortunately, the film, like the novel, promotes a destructive, romantic myth of a south that never really existed.In this Technicolor version of the Old South all the darkies are happy and smiling and dancing on the banks of the Mississippi, and obviously it's too bad the Civil War came along and ruined things. What a trashy message, and the terrible thing is that its wrapped in such a seductive and attractive package.
0	Awful, twice over!: I bought this for a Mother's Day gift--TWICE.My mom reported that most of the discs didn't work, so I returned it for a new set. Amazingly, the new replacement set didn't work either! I felt bad enough for Mom that I had to write this review and warn others.I finally learned my lesson: Take Mom out for dinner and a play instead of wasting time and money on this piece of....er, junk.
1	Gone With the Wind: Very happy with the DVD and the timely manner in which it was shipped. Amazon always does an amazing job of gettingthe product out to the customer. Thank you. I give this item a 5 star rating.
1	Gone With the Wind is the BEST!!!!!!!!!!!!: There isn't a whole lot to say that hasn't already been said about Gone With The Wind. What a magnificent motion picture for it's day and now for today as well. The DVDS' are a tribute to this must have film for your home library.
0	boring: I hope I'm watching the same movie that got so many 5 stars!! I found this movie to be big time boring. Couldn't even handle fast forward :)
0	gone with the wind: This sucked because it arrived with only one dvd in it, it should of had two. I wanted to return it but my printer is dead so I couldn't print the return so I wasted my money. this the second purchase in a row from amazon that was bad i am sure it will be a while before I order from amazon again if i ever do.
1	most excellent: At least for the beginner (myself), this was great for learning how to give a back massage.
0	These books are terrible!: Before you buy the Remote Access book from Tom Thomas read my comments on Tom Thomas's BCSN book.
1	Wonderful!: Despite having seen and enjoyed the film featuring Humphrey Bogart, I got this book, knowing it deviated from the screenplay (or, rather, the screenplay had deviated from this original novel!). I was very glad to have read this. Only the setting and names are the same - otherwise, a completely different, very suspenseful and psychologically wrought piece. Highly recommend.
1	For Maggie the Mod dog: If you are one of those consumers (as I am) that will purchase products because of aesthetics, then this product is for you/your dog. We have the large version and it is almost too big for our black lab--it holds a lot of food. The bowl has a nice weight to it and non-skid feet. Please note that our turquoise bowl faded, and although this bowl is dishwasher-safe we washed it by hand. The underside of the bowl stayed bright turquoise, but the exposed side faded quite a bit in a few months. The polymer material the bowl is constructed of is heavy and sturdy, however, it is also very rigid and I discovered that if you drop the bowl it breaks into many sharp pieces. It's a great design and I would recommend purchasing it if you like the design, but expect the color to fade and handle carefully.
0	Rabin Solo Album + Yes: If you are a Rabin fan or a fan of Rabin-era Yes, you will probably like this one. I think it sounds pretensious and uninspired. Chris Squire is missing in action. Alan White pulls some strong beats out of the can, but the rest is pure Rabin.There are some songs I can stand but most I can't listen to all the way through. I got this for [low price] in the bargin bin and I am not sure I got a good deal.-A long time Yes fan
1	Best Yet!: I don't know what makes this product different from the others but so far it's the best I've used yet. I'm able to do just about anything within minutes of painting my nails.
1	Amazing!: I love this product! I really love all of OPI's products... but this works really well for me. After a minute they are dry to the touch and after 5 minutes they are set. I will say that if you apply base, plus 2 coats of color and then a top coat it will take longer for them to completely dry but your nails will be somewhat dry. If you skip a layer of polish or the base they will dry much quicker.
0	Doesnt work.: Honestly I dont think this product works. I followed instructions carefully and it did not work. My manicure was not fully dry at all.
0	DW may be better than MS-FrontPage, but ....: I read somewhere that DreamWeaver was released to compete against Microsoft's FrontPage 97-98.Apparently the author was not aware of this fact, or else he would have done his homework and explore the POWER of DreamWeaver.I am working on a GeoCities web page dedicated to some "tricks" not covered in this book (or anywhere else). If anyone has any questions, requests, or comments, PLEASE email me. I'm here to help.
1	Place in the woods: Ecellent book to read. If you like wilderness books it is hafta read book. Interesting through out. Book keeps your attention through out
1	I keep going back to this book!: Green Darkness is one of those rare books that I keep rereading year after year. I just read it again after seeing "Elizabeth" and am reminded of what an excellent book this is. It is truly one of my favorites!
1	100 Stars!!!: This book was amazing! I absolutely LOVED it. It was hard to believe that this book was written in1972! Just like in Katherine(written in1954!), Anya Seton has done it again! I loved this book!
0	Trying to be Cujo: Okay, Cujo was a dog gone wrong, while this bear merely wanted revenge for the killing of his mate. But the rest of it seems more like what I wrote as my review title, with some drama thrown in: brother vs. brother and so on.
0	Possibly the worst book ever about motorcycling: The author may be a great guy but this book is just plain awful. I've read almost every book published on touring and this thing is the worst hands down. If you need to read a "motorcycle" book to know it's hot in Texas, Motel 6 has noisy air conditioners, chicken fried steak can be nauseating - and be told this in EVERY FREAKING CHAPTER!, than you may be able to get through his book. I gave up halfway through when the "poetry" showed up, it's hard to believe a grown man could write such drivel. I don't think I've ever had a more visceral dislike of a book than I experienced toward this one.
0	doesn't shoot: when it does shoot, it's awesome. but i got it today and shot it about 200 times and it worked about 5
0	brothersjudddotcom barely recommends: When the Bridge of San Luis Rey collapses, in Peru in1714, and five travellers plummett to their deaths, Brother Juniper asks, "Why did this happen to those five?" Wilder proceeds to tell us the stories of these travellers & we are asked to examine whether there is any reason that God would choose these specific people for this fate.I remember reading this book in Junior High or High School and not getting it; I'm afraid I still don't. I suppose the book's well written, but I just don't care that these people die and the ultimate lesson we're left with--there is a bridge of love that binds the living and the dead--just seems completely platitudinous.
0	What am I missing? I found the book dull and unsatisfying.: I have read all the positive reviews and I am a bit stumped. I found the early chapter about the relationship between the mother and daughter very tedious and meaningless. I almost stopped reading after that chapter, but slogged on through the rest of the book with little uptick in enjoyment. I believe people just feel they have to love and praise the "classics" no matter what. I found the book dull and unsatisfying. I'm so glad it was a short book. The most enjoyable part of the book was looking up the many words I did not understand. I'm very glad I put the [...] app on my iPhone.
1	Emerson Lake & Palmer at the top of their game!: This U.K. Sony re-master is the best sounding of all there re-issues of this album, it's too bad it's being lumped with the Shout Factory version. Get this version it's just tremendous!
0	Save Your Money: I agree with Jeff's review below. The sound on this thing is horrific. It's mega-compressed and overly bright. The more they mess with this album. the worse it sounds. Go back and find the original Atlantic version...crank up your stereo...and enjoy the *dynamics* of the music.
0	recall: We obtain a vinyl disc ELP "Brain salad surgery" production Shout! factory records. The disc has on both sides of the broad transverse stripes. As Grading is similar to the Fair. It happened at the factory packaging. Although the seller advertised it as new. I would like to sent me a new drive, without damage, and even without an envelope.
0	Pfaltzgraff Dinnerware Set: One Plate already cracked. I ordered round Serving Bowl, to large! Coffee Mugs to big!
0	Could have been about skateboarding: Would appeal to out of work 20 somethings who find hooting out loud a significant expression of inner experience. Could have been subtitled "Hiking with your bar buddies, are we thirty ,yet?."Some nice footage. better vids abound.
1	Indian Territory: You cannot get much better than a good Gene Autry movie. The Quality is very good and the restoration is top notch.
1	Singable Psalms: For over ten years I have shared these settings of the Psalms with Christians and Jews in worship services. Webber's wording is creative and current. His choice of metrical patterns makes these psalms usable with literally hundreds of tunes familiar to all who worship with these ancient Hebrew poems. I could wish Webber had versified the entire Psalter, though he has included most sections regularly in use in English speaking congregations. I warmly recommend using these settings to all who love to sing, and love to sing the psalms. By choosing familiar tunes from any source, a music leader can newly invigorate several generations of worshippers.
0	Leaves much to desire: The book provides a good chart of all of the Outlook 2000 objects but gives few good programming examples. Nowhere does it show how to login as an outlook user and then create and send an email. Spends too much time on the Outlook database vs. task list as if it were the only part of Outlook a developer would be interested. Not worth the money.
0	LOVE Jim Croce, the "remastering" sucks!: The remastering makes the recording tinny & lacks depth.Sad thing to do to Jim Croce's music.This was the BEST album made, the music was originally some of the most beautiful, earthy, talented music ever recorded...There may have been some poorly remastered dicks & some not? so you might want to take a chance & see what it sounds like to you. I did NOT get mine here, so cold have been a bad run???The album is fantastic! Jim Croce died WAY too young. He was VERY talented.
1	Oustanding collection: This album was a must-have for me because of all the tracks in general and one in particular. It is also a well-made album with very good acoustic quality. "Time in a Bottle" is a special song for my wife and I. So is "I'll Have to Say I Love You in a Song"; and there are other favorites on this and other albums. In January 2011 we celebrated our 40th Anniversary with dinner at Croce's Restaurant in San Diego. (Owned by his widow Ingrid. If you are a Jim Croce fan and in or visiting San Diego, going here should be at or near the top of your to-do list.)
0	Horrible text: My daughter uses this series for sixth grade Social Studies. I think it is among the worse textbooks I have ever seen. The book is written as a narrative with no bullets, highlights, underlined points or emphasis of any kind. The problem with this is the first time reader of American History needs to know what is important and what they need to focus on. They have no base knowledge of the subject and not all fact are equal. In addition, there is no glossary which is annoying for the students when creating flash cards for assessments. I am not going to go into the inaccuracies of the text (there are quite a few) or the obvious religious biased, but I think that a more structured book is appropriate for first time American History student. This book is more of "reader" then a text- they don't even have question or a vocabulary list for each chapter.
0	Very bad quality!!! Don't buy.: Sigma watch has a very poor quality. I bought I PC7 one year ago and the first time I put it under the shower it stops working (it was supposed to be 3m water resistance). I sent to sigma and I have to pay for all transport expenses from (From China to Brazil).After1 year the battery is down and the back is rusty (I have a10 year old Casio watch that is used in swimming in pool and seawater and does not have any rusty).Don't recommend Sigma watches.
1	Fantasic HRM with all the features you need, a best buy: I have used this HRM for 4 months now and love it. I mainly use it riding my bike. Comes with a handlebar quick-mount for bike that is nice to use so can see it always without taking hands of bar.Trying to decide I found Polar (and others) had too many models and they carefully structured features/price to make you spend $50 to $150 more. This HRM has a ton of features (all that I need) and a great flexible display. I don't think it has a light.While working I like to display the Heart menu so I can see % of max constantly and a % graph and my current HR. It's easy to move thru the menus and see all the info. Keeps a running tally of calories, I think I burned 20,000 so far.The Sigma Sport website is very well done and shows all the info you need to decide. This is a best buy.
1	Tarzan rocks: My son had this game when he was young and I just loved to play it. This copy does try to act up on me a little but with patience, I can get it working. I love this game!
1	A poigant book: This book was wonderful when I read it as a child, and now when I read it. It's incredible, a very grown up tale , yet it can be read at any age. Rumer Godden is a wonderful author, and this book will capture your heart like nothing else - except maybe The Mouse and his Child. It is the story of a family living in The DollHouse, and learning to come to terms with themselves, it is both happy and sad........but ultimately rewarding.
0	Very disturbing book: I have to agree with the others who warn that this book is unsuitable for children. In fact, I'm researching this book online today because just now (in my early 30s) I suddenly had a flashback to the horrible scene of Birdie's burning. I read this book when I was in 4th or 5th grade and, like others have said, the sickening feeling it gave me-- not just the burning scene, but the ugliness of the whole moral universe of that book-- has stuck with me all these years. It's *not* that I believe in coddling and sheltering children from the harsh realities of life. I read plenty of books as a child that featured cruelty, heartlessness and violence, and *none* of them disturbed me as deeply as this one did. Based on my first-hand experience of how this book reads from the perspective of a child, I wholeheartedly advise parents not to subject their children to it. There are better choices.
1	Strange, strange book...: I am unable to categorize this book. As the title says, this is about advanced Perl programming, but chapter1-9 really belongs in "Programming Perl" (but are totally missing from it), and should really not be considered advanced (on the other hand, quite elementary, but since they appear nowhere else, you should probably consider this book a must read, if you are serious about Perl).The rest of the book is pretty random, covering various topics the author thought was neat, and wanted to write about. This is ranging from trivial use of CPAN libraries (Tk), to trivial Perl but involving knowledge from other disciplines (networking), to actual useful advanced Perl programming (persistence, template-driven code-generation, and the C programming interface). This part of the book is also highly recommended (and in fact the reason I bought it), but should have been much longer.
1	Excellent Resource: O'Relly books are generally great sources and this one is no exception. I've been programming with Perl for CGI, NetAdmin, SysAdmin, and various data tasks for almost 4 years. Anybody who knows Unix will know a lot more by knowing Perl and advanced Perl takes you to the next level. Tell archie to stop whining and cop to his real name...
0	Short-Lived: When it worked, it was great: easy to use, and easy to clean.The problem is that the power started cutting out, less than six months after purchase. The problem appeared to be with the power cord itself. I kept my receipt, filled out the warranty card, etc, thinking that if I had a problem, GE would honor the one-year warranty, which is suppose to replace any part which is defective...no such luck.First of all, you are expected to take it to a GE servicer, and pick it up later, or else you have to pay a fee to have it serviced in your home. Then I was given the run-around because they tried to say the cord was damaged after it was delivered to the store that sold it, but the store said it was GE's responsibility.Basically, don't buy this microwave if you expect GE to honor the warranty. I ended up buying another brand from a different store to avoid this scenario again.I recommend theEmerson .9 cu. ft. 900-Watt Microwave -.
0	Poor Quality: I don't recommend this microwave. Think it only lasted about a year. A little over...spend a little more and get something that will last longer. Evidently the parts on this were not made to last long. One day it just started being really noisy and no cooking think that says the magnetron (microwave producing element) was dead. I am glad i did not review after purchase coz now can let folks know it is not made to last...I will get another brand this time around!
0	HORRIBLE!!!: I bought these last spring for trapping and they lasted the one week I trapped muskrats with just a small leak, I thought i just went over the top of them a little bit. Then I took them out for smallmouths a few weeks later and I found the leak. Then this fall trapping muskrats and raccoon this fall they just completely fell apart the soles started falling off, they had big rips near the calf, and the part that attaches to your belt broke, and the next day the other one fell off! So I had to spend the rest of the week in leaky falling down pieces of crap! I would never recommend this to anyone! It is just a horrible product. I would not even buy another Hodgman product. I was so dissatisfied with this do not buy it.
0	Waste of money: These waders only lasted three outings. They were always rinsed off after use, hung to dry, then stored properly, stuffed with newspaper. By the beginning of the fourth outing, the left boot had cracked, where the foot flexes at the toes. By the end of the trip, the right one had cracked in the same spot. They aren't worth the money, or the soaked feet.
1	A starter for any potential Orb fan!: I remember the first time I heard an Orb song. It was during one of my weekened/midnight excursions around Dallas and they played "Fluffy Little Clouds" I got the weirdest sensation when I first listend to this song. Felt like someone was lightly running the tip of a very cold knife up and down my spine. I LIKED IT! So I ran out and grabbed this particular album. Some of the songs grabs you immediately. Others take time to grow on you.Having said that if you get any of their other albums, don't expect the same. Expect DIFFERENT....very different styles and samplings.I give it 4 in stead of 5, because I'm hoping for a better album when it comes out.
1	A great album: This is a really nice ambient album, the kind of album you can close your eyes and think while listening to it, also a good album to go to sleep to. If you like ambient music buy it, if you haven't heard ambient buy it to see what ambient is.
0	Your10-year-old brother with a trance track: Once again I've been suckered by glowing reviews into purchasing an album that could have been made by an auto plant robot. It's basically the opening track of "Dark Side of the Moon" overlaid with old newscast voices and your little brother blowing bubbles through his straw. The best I can say for this is that it's not as obnoxious as Lesiem's "Mystic Spirit Voices." I'm sticking with Steve Roach.
0	USB connection in tablet fails.: I bought this tablet and at first it worked fine. However after a couple of months it started failing. I would plug it in and nothing would happen - as if it's not connecting. Juggling the cord where it attached to the tablet would cause the light to flash on and off and if you held it 'just right' it would work... for a few minutes.Now it simply does not work at all.Other than that it worked fairly well when it worked. I did not like the included software - it was difficult to use and looked 'kludgy' to me.I suppose you get what you pay for...
1	Sounds immediately attracted my 7 year old Grandson: The musical sounds immediately attracted the attention of my 7 year old Grandson. It is a charming disc and one worth purchasing.
0	great propoganda: This book is a great example for teaching children about the pilgrims and everything they believed in such as religious freedom (except if you weren't a god fearing christian) and settling new frontiers (AKA conquering territory and making already settled people miserable) Hats off to the author for this book glorifying an essentially moronic culture.
0	A decent mug, but it has poor insulation: If you like to drink your coffee fast, this is the mug for you! Even with preheating, coffee only stays hot for 2 hours. The outside of the mug feels warm immediately after filling. I expected better performance. Other features are fine such as the stylish look and tight seal, but for an extra five bucks you can get a top of the line travel mug that performs its core function better.
0	Doesn't flow; big disappointment: I had the prior version of this mug and loved it. As other posters have noted, Trudeau unfortunately changed the design of the lid for the worse. The new lid, which screws into the mug, does not permit an adequate flow of the coffee when it is in the open position. Drinking it while I drove my car, I had to literally lean my head back and use gravity to get enough coffee to come out. That lead to the coffee leaking onto my shirt (which I should have seen coming). I tried to loosen the screw on the bottom of the lid as others mentioned, but I still can't get enough coffee to come out of it when it's in the open position. I don't have the same problems with it leaking that some others have mentioned, but that just tells me that this is an inconsistent, poorly made product.
0	Disappointed: When I try to drink from the cup very little of the liquid comes out. I tried to adjust screw of lid as was suggested. It worked but next time I used it it went back to allowing very little of liqui to come out. I like the design etc but the lid is not good for drinking from.
0	The reviews are for the wrong performance!: The performance is, according to the description, by Jansug Kakhidze, Tbilisi Symphony Orchestra, not Rattle. What's going on? Did I download Kakhidze or Rattle? It would be nice to know. The performance I heard sounded pretty lightweight compared to others I've heard, but I don't know who's performance I heard.
0	Only symbols and images, no concepts!: This book does tell you some essential things about LINUX, but this is not enough at all. Being surrounded by pictures and tips, I really can't learn anything that concerns the main part of LINUX. It is no better than a thickened Redhat user's manual! Too Pratical! If you really want to "LEARN" LINUX, you'd better go and buy RUNING LINUX which is far better than this book!
1	Classic!: I first heard about Larry from the Blue Collar Comedy Tour. The thing I like best about Larry is he shows you can be funny without cursing and making sex jokes left-and-right. I think most commedians curse just to get people in the audience.Larry is funny, and you don't have to be raised in the South to appreciate him, though it couldn't hurt.
1	Excellent book, worth buying.: "Cats for Dummies is a book for any cat lover or owner. I recommend it.
1	It takes a lot of time and practice: The graphics in this game were somewhat bad, but the game itself is very amusing. Some levels are fun and some make you want to tear your hair out. I like the fact that Bugs Bunny literally lives on 6 hit points (from what I remember) and basically infinite lives. There were ton of levels in the game where it takes a lot of time and practice to get right and sometimes they become frustrating. It actually took me years to finally complete this game one time. As a kid and even for adults, this game is enjoyable.
1	...Here's To One More...: Not often does an indie band make such a hugh impression, but impressions aren't everything it seems nowadays.Why isn't this band huge? It doesn't always require a major label to get the job done. There is just enough radio friendly catchyness here to make an impact.Maybe that's why it's not really nessecary, these songs in this album stand together or alone so perfectly balancing one another that it demands to be listened to from track one to ten. Female vocals occasionally finding there way in add such a depth, a relaztion to the songs, that you stop everything and just listen. These songs aren't dancehall or heavy metal, but this album proves the potential of dramatic freeform rock, which isn't in your face.My hat goes off to Lydia, but no 5 stars sadly in my book, becuase I felt like they could've done so much more here. Every song feels ready to be implanted with the growth of something more, but it just never happens.Can't wait to hear more.
1	Excellent Reference for BIND version 4: This Book is a must have for anyone seriously doing DNS work today. The upcoming 3rd edition will cover BIND Version 8, but the substance of DNS and how it works on the Internet is fully and delightfully covered in both previous editions.The Authors are completely knowledgeable about DNS and share that knowledge in a straighforward comfortable style that makes DNS & BIND a fun read while imparting loads of DNS wisdom.
0	Great idea...too much errata: I bought this book thinking it would be a nice kick-start to ASP and Visual InterDev. I was wrong.If you don't have programing know-how the the consistant errata and lack of coding standards will cause you to not get past Day1.The coding, which standards change from day to day, leaves out important details, chnages methods in doing the same tasks, and if you type it directly from the book, will cause your programs from Day 2 on to not work correctly.The amount of errata makes what could have been a good book a sub-standard one, and what is worse is that the Author only lists 2 errata on his website, when I found multiple errata throughout the book...at least 2-3 per 'day'.Stick with a WROX beginners book and you'll fair much better and save yourself some frustration.I've been programing for over10 years, and without my previous knowledge, I would have never figured out the errors in the coding.
0	Arabian Prince bombs on his comeback CD...: I got this CD not too long ago, I expected songs similar to the album 'Brother Arab', but Arabian Prince changed up his style. Now he used slow synthed strings, and more sexual lyrics then before. He found another rapper named Side Show to help back him up, probably because Arabian Prince wasn't use to this kind of rap style. The album had the gangsta beat with too much emphasis on b-tches and f----n. There are maybe three tracks that are enjoyable to listen to, but the other ones sound to repetitive or just too slow. The highlight of the album is the song "Underworld" when Arabian Prince brings back a fast tempo song about the ghetto. The best slow-synth song would be "Ho's 2 Bozack". A.Prince brings a lot of the NWA's production crew to make the album. I don't have the import version of this album, but i think there are maybe one or two bonus songs.
1	Excellent production of a classic story: If you enjoyed Good Bye Mr Chips and Harry Potter, you'll enjoy this moving saga of a former soldier, shattered by the horrors of trench warfare, who finds his true calling in teaching at a British boarding school between the World Wars.
1	Five Easy Gardens- Anyone can grow the prime...: This book is an invaluable asset in showing the home grower something that all the other books virtually overlook, a production budget! Each easy garden is detailed with step-by-step, and itemized list of components with cost, and typical output. The reader can determine which methods most resemble something they could achieve... This will move all growers that are getting started in the right direction.We, at Spice of Life Seeds, routinely advise new growers to purchase one of Señor Cervantes books. They are never disappointed. All the Best to Jorge, and I look forward to his next releases.
0	Out of date: There are still some sound principles in this book, but it's a decade old and you can get all of the same information but updated and in full color in Jorge's other books.Jorge should either update this book or take it out of print because there are a dozen other better books on growing, including his own.I returned this book after reading a few chapters...
1	good for sensitive skin: truly good, this product is light weight and not at all greasy. It is pretty good on very sensitive skin, and after i used it the first night there was a noticeable difference in my acne, like they were reduced and my skin felt much softer. Great product.
1	Good old fashioned entertainment: First of all, the only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is that the sound quality is a bit variable; some episodes are better than others. But given the age of the original recordings and the necessary transfer to the new format, I can't complain. This is a ripping yarn of the best quality, each part about15 minutes long, so I find it great for filling in those short breaks in my day when I have a half hour to kill. The story is damn close to the original book by Sax Rohmer, and it works really well as a serial. Don't expect political correctness, though! If you want a good old fashioned adventure yarn with some creepy overtones, give it a go. (And the company do a buy one get one free for overseas customers)
1	Great band: Why didn't I heard about this band?Back in the seventies listened STYX,KANSAS,SUPERTRAMP and the likes,but I never heard about ANGEL. Thanks for these reissues I accidentally stumbled on them.What a treat.All 4 albums are great and if you like seventies music,you must buy ANGEL. they A RE FANTASTIC.
1	Dark and disturbing: Intense, riveting look at the heroin business, as cops Patric and Jason-Leigh get sucked into their under cover roles. Look fast for Greg Allman as a smack dealer. But be warned, this movie has got some real unhappy moments!!!
1	A drug movie that's really a love story: I like this movie. I saw it years ago when it first came out and it really "stayed with me." The thought of having to immerse yourself in the drug culture to do your job, and then finding it so difficult not to succumb to the addiction. Very powerful story. Not a feel good movie, but one that you can definitely get personally involved in!
1	Red Hart Magic: This book gives insight into the history of England during one of its turblent periods. It also gives a clear look at the problems facing children in new and strange circumstances. It is great reading for early teens.
0	boring: I am a confirmed obsessive Linkin Park fan. I personally found this a bit boring. This is unauthorized so it did not have enough of the band contributing to the project.
1	White Plasti Dip: I use this product to cover my metal flower baskets that hang in my garden. I wish that it covered better and I didn't have to spray so many coats. Very time-consuming and uses product up quickly. However, does the job and I will purchase again.
1	Outdoor thermometer: The Thermometer itself seems to be a good product, but there was no protective packaging in the box; therefore the thermometer arrived with a broken piece (which fortunately my husband was able to superglue back on).
1	outdoor thermometer: pleased with the size of the numbers....easy to read and the accuracy of the temp is reasonabley close to weather reports.
0	it stopped working accurately!!!: I had one similar for many years that was accurate until someone's dog jumped up and knocked if off the fence breaking it. I bought this to replace it, however, I can't imagine how this can't work unless it is made of really shoddy materials. It reads way off the correct temperature as told by my radio controlled weather station.My advice - don't buy it. The manufacturers will get the message eventually and make a decent product. As long as we are buying and putting up with shoddy goods they will keep producing them making us part of the problem!!!
0	Disappointed: I ordered this thermometer as a gift for my mom and didn't even give it too her. It felt flimsy and cheap.
1	Misunderstood?: I've read a lot of negative reviews about this film, but I absolutely love it. Can't really tell you why - the music, the characters, the way all the characters mesh, the storyline. I also happen to love a few of these actors - Keven Kline, Steve Martin and Danny Glover, people who always make a film enjoyable for me, no matter what surrounds them. I guess I just want to say, if you've read a few negative reviews, please be aware that not everybody hates this film. You may want to give it a try, and you may actually enjoy it.
0	a real piece of junk: This is the worst mop I have ever owned! I really expected better. Now I understand why the replacement sponges were in the closeout store. They are wonderful, if they would just stay on the handle. I contacted the manufacturer and the replacement mop they provided is just as bad. The replacement is not cellulose sponge and does not clean the floor. I give up on Mr Clean mop products.
0	Worst mop ever!: It doesn't pick up the grime just moves it around...you think you get quality when buying a trusted name such as Mr. Clean. I can't believe this is on shelves...
0	SUCKS! SPONGE WONT STAY ON!: This product sucks. The sponge that pops in really easily also POPS BACK OUT even more easily.Basically you get a mope handle that assembles fairly easily and no mop to go with it.
1	Again I have the movie/book/and tape series...use them in class: The first time I read this I knew this was perfect for teacher, coaches, counselors the whole smear...never a better book written except maybe the bible/or Vince Lombardi's Run To Daylight.
1	"A Voice Many Seek but Few Ever Hear": I first came across the works of Denis Waitley in late1996, as I began my first steps towards entrepreneurship. It was via audio tape, which contained most if not all of the contents of this book, nonetheless, here was a complete stranger telling Me: I could succeed, I could achieve, I could do things - encouragement I was not getting from my immediate family, my peers, my "friends" at that time.Someone once said: You will become like the information you input into your mind and the people you associate with. If that's the truth, then, I am indeed one step closer to where I wish to be in my life, and YOU can be there, too.
0	The Psychology of Winning: Your ad made it look like I was purchasing the actual book, The Psychology of Winning.What you sent me was some cheap workbook that was of absolutely NO use to me. I was extremely disappointed
1	cd review: The classic Oscar Peterson Trio makes jazz music like no other and the quality of this re-mastering is exceptional. As an audiophile I can't recommend this cd highly enough. It has become one of my reference cd's. The opening cut has some of the best recorded bass I've ever heard and the other instruments are equally well represented. Buy and enjoy.
0	really for dummies...: It was my first "for dummies" book and most probably the last. The book is big and empty; the author should have used at most 50 pages. The CD contains short musical clips that you've probably heard before or you can download for free. I gave it two stars because the book actually helps a small tiny bit contrary to its size.I recommend instead "Alfred's Group Piano for Adults" it's much better but I'm not sure if it's the best one out there.
0	Look elsewhere.: Even though the book does embody several hints on playing the piano, two stars are still generous. The book lacks coherency and is a mind-dulling read at best. Constant attempts at humor make for twitching and disgust. It is hard to stay focused and interested in this book, no matter how ambitious the pianist. There are other great books out there that demonstrate the piano beautifully and that have a much stronger appeal. My recommendation is to keep looking and don't stop here.
0	Who's the Dummy?: I bought this book out of curiosity rather than as a teaching guide as I already play the piano to grade 8 (ABRSM).I wish I had not bothered and kept my14.99. The book is written by a dummy for dummies or more aptly by a moron for morons. The incessant attempt at humour is offputting from the start and the content is disjointed and lacks any conceptual ideas of what music and the piano is really about.The CD accompanying the book is a joke, and if this is an example of the author's musical skill I shudder to think what else he has produced. The irritating keyboard rhythms and styles are a throw back to the Bontempi school of music.IMO this book is pants and is not worthy to carry the name Piano in its title. Save your money and don't buy it, there are lots of other very good "easy books" on teaching beginners the piano.
0	Worse remake than Planet of the Apes, Godzilla, or Oh.. Just any of them: Please people, stop going to see remakes. If we stop going, they will stop making them. Jackson's Kong was worse than the 70's remake of Kong. Much worse. I agree100% with Floyd the Barber's review. The only thing I will add is that the scene in NYC when Kong finds Anne in the backlite street is a contender for top 2 worst movie moments in history. The audience I saw this with laughed out loud at this moment. I had serious high hopes for this film. I went to the midnight opening for pete's sake. But just like the new Star Wars films these hack filmmakers have let the public down. Most people in this country don't have health care. But they waste millions of dollars on crap films like this. So my call to action is to not give them any more of our hard earned money. Ban all remakes. Tell Hollywood to get new ideas or get out! Thank you, that is all.
1	tremendous!!!: Just go see it!! Art for the sake of art. please ignore sierocks review...the message of the film is beyond him!!
0	Silly and Too Dramatic: I love the other films Peter Jackson has made. The best is Heavenly Creatures, if you have not seen this movie your missing out! I thought this movie was overly dramatic and to long. Had many unbeliveable moments and was so far fetched! The only cool thing about it was the natives, they were freaky.
1	Spectacular!: Peter Jackson takes the metaphor, if you can bring an unprecedented find to the world for the price of an admission ticket, you've got a spectacular show. And King Kong delivers on the premise in sheer scope, cenematic beauty, and bigger-than life story. The production was phenomenal in almost every way. In one instance, when Kong was sliding autos around the streets of Broadway, like a kid crashing matchbox cars, did the action look like CG creation (something in the sliding ape didn't look convincing). In every other scene, the work was awesome, detailed, and completely credibly produced.Watch for character nuances in the non-speaking CG role of Kong, and you'll see another reason this 3rd-generation remake justifies the hype it got. Kong is a sympathetic character with a soft spot for Ann Darrow. Worth the 3 hours of pure enjoyment.
1	Great But Not Quite Five Stars: This movie was excellent. It borrows a lot from the original with incredible special effects and amazing recreations of1931 New York! King Kong finally moves like a real gorilla and the destruction that gets wrecked throughout the movie is very convincing! The natives of this movie look like something out of the Exorcist although there was a tribute to the original natives during the scene where Kong is displayed to the New York public at the theater.There are a lot more dinousaurs in this one including a lot of prehistoric insect creatures that look convincingly real. I didn't give it 5 stars for the following reasons:- many of the scenes seemed to be excruciatingly long- I was not crazy about Jack Black's portrayal of Carl Denham- I may have been a little bit prejudiced having seen the original so I knew exactly what was going to happen. I am sure people being introduced to Kong for the first time will love it!
0	King Kong & Bionic Woman: Close to 4.30 hours long in which more than half of it were entirely useless and have no relevance to the movie specifically that bombastic CGI Lost World scene. The scenes defies logic and reality with all those acrobatic stunts of Naomi Watts by Kong even a solid unripe hard cucumber would end up mushy. It is totally incomprehensible that our heroine ended up with no bruises, no welts and unbroken bones. Another failed attempt to create a modern epic with an intended complete menu which ended up a spoiled meal.
1	Kong, the Miniseries: They should have just made this a miniseries and then they would have been able to have more side stories and characters that they seemed to want. BUT, they put it all in one movie. Overall, good movie, there are some tense moments (dinosaur chase, bug attack)..and it all reminded me of Jurrassic Park. King Kong was animated really well, but everything else was kind of wierd looking and you could tell it was green screen behind them (but I guess that's what they were looking for). You may find yourself forwarding most scenes just to get through this without going crazy. Recommend - - but forward through slow parts.
1	Best King Kong yet: I loved the first King Kong movie in black & white. But this movie was for me more enjoyable because of the special effects. The dinosaur fights were excellent. I loved the developement with King Kong as having a personality and the interaction between him and the girl. She even uses her vaudville act on Kong and he pretends to not be ammused but she wins him over eventually. Black is OK as the promoter of the adventure to find the mysterious island. He is a bit of a ham and overacts at times but that is his nature. He acts with the intensity of a Tom Cruise but just doesn't have quite Tom's magnetism. I would have given the movie 5 stars but they could have cut short the human eating giant insect scene in the chasm. The scene lasted over ten minutes (or seemed like it) and makes the movie out of reach of most children to enjoy. The old King Kong was accessable to all age groups something lost in this new one. However I still loved this movie.
1	KING BONG !: Great movie in HD. Almost as good as the theater. But I had to go to a freinds house to watch it because it wouldnt play (obviously) on my standard DVD player nor (curiously) my Bluray player hmmmmmmmm.... You should probably mention that in the HD descriptions, My bad ;(
0	Visually stunning. But a terriable movie: BORING. LONG. It stars Jack Black, which automatically makes it bad. But the drawn-out story just makes it worse.On the positive side, it looks good. HD-DVD is a winner. And the fairly reasonably priced XBox 360 HD-DVD adapter is well worth every penny.
0	Too much of a CGI fest: Just watched KK for the first time. Unaware of the pointless nature of most of the film. I never believed that any of the characters had any personal business on Skull Island.The bugs, dinosaurs, and weird evil natives were as overdone as burnt toast that sets off the smoke alarm. There were too few scenes that would give the movie any positive spin. You know bad guys smashed or something. The point of the movie according to Mr. Jackson was that bugs, people, and dinosaurs are evil and that KK is an overgrown primate trapped in world that tortures him daily and finally kills him. Oh, yeah the movie is great if you would like a CGI headache.
0	Over-Rated, Cheesy, Boring, Corny, OVER-RATED!: By the time everyone gets to Skull Island you are bored. Jurassic Park showed us ground-breaking dinosaur CGI and we were scared by the dinosaurs.Seeing a bloated Jack Black outrun a RAPTOR, while holding his hat onto his head, was more hokey than hokey. I was laughing at how the dinosaurs were flying by everyone (with less than an inch between them) in the stampede.No one seemed at all "surprised" by the fact that they ended up on an island filled with prehistoric life.The bug cavern scene was neat, which is why this gets1 star.Why would Adrian Brody's character go off on his own? Did the bugs decide to ignore him? No one wondered off on their own in Jurassic Park.
1	AN INSTANT CLASSIC!: This was incredible. I cannot wait for this to come on DVD. I liked this a little beter than Peter Jackson's Lord Of The Rings.
1	Fun but not Classic: Not exactly Peter Jacksons best work but for what it lacks in acting and editing it makes up for in its CG and its fun action. On bluray it pops and u have yourself a fun popcorn movie.
0	Largely Irrelevant Scholasticism: After having lived in Cambodia for 2 years and having read several books on Cambodian religion and Buddhism in general, I approached this book with great anticipation. I read it over the course of 3 months, writing a review of each chapter and discussing each chapter in a forum.Generally, I found this book to be of little value in understanding "New Religious Movements in Cambodia." The authors demonstrate a noted lack of philosophical self-awareness and thus interpret Cambodian religion through a post-Enlightenment humanistic grid. If you want to know how a Cambodian views his religion, this book is not for you.Several of the chapters are written poorly to the point that the thesis is almost unintelligible. Fortunately, the introduction to each section states in clear terms what the thesis of each chapter is. Highly scholastic work does not need to be difficult to read. This book often is.Chapters 3, 5 and 7 are worthwhile, so it will remain on my shelf.
0	Doesn't work: I plugged it in to my machine. Windows made "Chirp" sound it makes when I plug in a flash drive, and the little green icon in the lower right showed up, that I click to removed the drive, and the J drive appeared in my Folders pane in Windows. But when I clicked on the J drive, I got an error message saying "Please insert a disk into Drive J".Doesn't work. POS.
1	The BEST bread flour I have ever used!: The 50 lbs bag arrived in just a few days.. $4.95 shipping is unbeatable. I bagged it n1 gallon plastic bags and packed them into a large lard can to keep fresh.. the container is now in our root cellar. For my first loaf I tried a basic French Bread recipe that includes beaten egg whites added to the water.. no oil.. just flour, sugar, yeast, water, salt.. and, from1lb 4 oz of flour I produced the most awesome, seriously authentic French style baguettes (x2) that I have EVER made! I have no idea what makes this unbleached flour so special, but I'm not looking back!
1	I love him: IT WAS CCCCCRACK!!!i love him and the album i think that it was betta lyrically then from me to u~but i love santana and the whole movement ever since it start i loved cam back when he was with mase so i am a dipset fan but really its good
0	Juelz should be missing his tongue: Yes the game has been missing the constant songs about drugs, girls, cars and jewelery. I tell you Juelz really came with an original formula with this album. The stuff he mentions on this one has never been said before and Juelz is an innovator as well as the rest of the dipset. LOL!!!! These guys listen to other peoples albums and just reiterate the same stuff in a different song and beat. Save your money.
1	MUST HAVE!: Awsome movie! Colorful! Entertaining! Funny and Sad! You will never get tired watching it over and over again!
1	It's A Wonderful Life: This is an awesome and timeless classic for the entire family. Just when you think you're life isn't going so well, watch this movie and it reminds you of what really is important in life. I recommend it highly and it's a great addition to your movie library.
1	One of the Greatest Christmastime Movies of All Time!: I've loved this movie since I first saw it when I was10 years old. Danny Kaye and Bing Crosby are two of the greatest actors that ever lived! My sister and I love to sing along with the "Sisters" song. (Speaking of which, if anyone knows where I can get a copy of that music please email me at ChristineDaae19@hotmail.com. My sister and I are looking for it for a variety show that we're doing for our church.) But seriously, it's one of the greatest Christmas musicals I've ever seen! The dancing and singing are spectacular and the songs are catchy. You might find yourself going around humming songs from that. This movie is a definite buy for those who love old musicals and want to get into the Christmas spirit.
1	White Christmas DVD: My mom and I would watch this movie every year when I was growing up. It just did not seem like Christmas until we watched White Christmas.
0	Terrible transfer: bad color alignment and often audio sync issues.: Unfortunately the DVD I purchased is worse than my aging VHS copy of this wonderful film. The color on this copy is out of alignment, resulting in a double film image (a separation between color and black-and-white). Bing's "baby blues" are lower than were they're supposed to be and hairlines (especially in the beginning when the men are in uniform) have a large color gap where you can see black and white (almost as if this were a colorized black and white film). I also had some trouble with the audio sync. I may have a bad copy, given all the good reviews but clearly this DVD is unwatchable! Big disappointment. I am returning it for a refund.
1	One of the best Christmas movies: One of the best Christmas movies. Our family has been decorating our Christmas Trees for over 20 years, and this is the movie that we watch each time. We needed to get it on DVD because the VCR version probably won't last much longer.
1	My favorite holiday movie: Such a deal getting it as a digital download. It will always be available when I need it! doesn't clutter up the DVD shelf for the remaining11 months of the year.
1	Great Classic!: A must-see for the Christmas season! I love Rosemary Clooney. Danny Kaye is wonderful in this movie - fun music.
1	good movie: I havent seen this one yet but my wife says its a good one so I bought it on her behalf. thank you amazon
0	The critics are right -- this movie isn't very good.: This is a subtle pro-war film that has nothing to do with Christmas. I can't believe Irving Berlin himself liked it. There are only a few things that make it worth watching. (1) Grady Sutton, who doesn't get nearly enough lines or screen time; (2) the quartet singing "Snow" in the dining car of the train; (3) the outfit Rosemary Clooney is wearing when she gets on the train as she "runs" away from Bing Crosby; and (4) Bing Crosby's apparent self-consciousness as he is undressing in front of Danny Kaye while being talked into following the girls (watch for it -- he hurriedly pulls his shirt down so the camera won't reveal the fact that he's wearing briefs!!!). Aside from all that, a real depressing movie.
1	It's a Wonderful Life: A Christmas classic. All these years later, life can still be the same as in this movie. Lot's of us are always striving, longing for a "better" more exciting life and many times if we stepped back and looked at ours it couldn't get any better, we just need to appreciate what we have and make the best of our life.
1	good movie: Loved the movie I haden't see it for at least 20 years and it still managed to entertain and delite me, a must see for all ages.
0	DULL, SLOW AND DULL: Good premise but slow snail pace slow and dull. The acting is stiff and uncomfortable. The story line could have been interesting if they had decided it was a comedy or drama.I know black men dating white women is accepted but white men dating black women is still taboo so the movie had potential but it just doesn't make any magic happen. The two leads don't even act as if they are comfortable with each other. Donald Fasion was the comic relief and he was good...but he was the only good thing about this movie. Rent it don't buy it.
1	Perfect.: This movie was WITTY, HILARIOUS, SEXY, and just WELL *DONE*!After seeing terrible movies like Beauty Shop which shamelessly and hypocritically use and abuse racial stereotypes, I was apprehensive about seeing a movie about interracial dating....I was so *more* than pleasantly surprised with "Something New."Sanaa Lathan hits the comedic notes perfectly and Simon Baker is a refreshing (and beautiful) face on the screen. Though it follows the general formula of any romance comedy, it definitely has a unique edge. I enjoyed every moment and was sad to see the movie end.DEFINITELY SEE IT!
1	Pretty good starter set: Like several posters have mentioned, these are a great, inexpensive, stylish set.I give it 4/5 because the steak knives are not one piece knives.
0	I thought kitchenaid was a good name,was I wrong: I just recieved my knife set 4 days ago.Last night a knife was left in the sink and it rusted.What is up with that.I would recommend not getting this product.The knife set I had at $60.00 never rusted in the10 years I had them.Shame on you kitchenaid for selling bad products.
0	Tailgate Grill - FAIL!!!: I will open with the expected "DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT". I ordered this grill for the first weekend of college football. The weather outside was nice, low 60's, light wind, sunny. I set the grill up with a new full16 oz. Coleman propane tank. After setting (and keeping) the grill to high, it took multiple attempts to keep the grill lit, despite the low wind. After 20 minutes the grill was still not hot, but I put on my1/4 lb hamburger patties. After mulitple attempts to keep the grill protected from any breeze, including putting the grill in the trunk of the car (do not try this at home), I pulled my burgers off after AN HOUR AND A HALF (1.5 hours). Despite this amount of time on the "grill" the meat was still raw and I went through an entire canister of propane. There was nothing else I could do to help this grill cook, short of breathing on it. Spend the extra money for a better grill!
0	There is a useful part: Although it was probably not worth the price of admission his discussion on preventing bugs was useful. Essentially, if you have1 week to do 2 weeks work you will produce buggy code.To avoid deadline stress like this he recommends a system for estimating work that consists of estimating what it would take if you could write it off the top of your head and giving it a factor from0 to 5? for how unaquainted with the component techniques you are. Then raise your intitial estimate to this power to get your estimate for how long you will take for this task.However, I agree with all the other criticisms.2 stars. Not absolutely aweful but I could write better.
0	QUALITY CONTROL PROBLEMS: I recently purchased the Maxxima 2 LED Night Light with White Lens (Pack of 2), and unfortunately I had the same quality control problem which several other customers have highlighted in their reviews of this product. The night lights are quite bright (which I wanted) and the soft white shades provide a nice quality of lighting. HOWEVER, the first time I plugged one in to the outlet, there was a flash and the smell of smoke - the night light shorted out and was dead. The second nightlight worked properly, but a 50% faulty rate is unacceptable. I also would agree with the other customers who commented that the "High" and "Low" illumination settings are not very different, the "Low" setting should be much dimmer than it is. Until the quality control issues are resolved, I would not recommend purchase of this item.
1	Human Resource Management: The book was in great condition and the delivery was timely. I am completely satisified.
1	This game is soooooo AWESOME!!!!!!!: I got this game for christmas. It was actually the only computer game I got for christmas. What I like to do is mix dif herbivores in the same exhibit (e.g. Savannah herbivores together). You get higher ratings from the guests if you do it that way. Another game I recommend is The Hobbit. Except you fight the animals instead of taking care of them. All in all, this is a terrific game!
1	Springfield13 Inch Thermometer: Nice and easy to read from a distance. Very lightweight. It does what it is advertised to do.
1	Like the Springfield Thermometer: We've only been using it for a few weeks at a school but it seems like it's pretty close to the correct temperature that another thermometer I have reads. I like how it has the humidity so you can figure out the "feels like" temperature and having the wind chill reading is good too.
0	Buy a mercury Thermo for accuracy ...: This thermometer registers temperature based on a metalic coil on the back of the unit. Mine read 4 to 7 degrees to low. The humidity indicator, as others have commented, simply doesn't work.Otherwise, it was an attractive ornament.I just threw it in the trash.If you want to know the temperature, I recommend the dual mercury thermometer for $10, including prime shipping, Reed MM2 Max-Min Analog Thermometer, -40 to120 Degrees F.You can't see it across the yard, but it's accurate.
0	Lame: I really hate when a writer true to write a military based book with little to no research, he couldn't even get the ranks right.
0	Not very complete. Too many ActiveX controls missing.: Don't believe the book's cover. The reference is not even a quarter complete. Many ActiveX controls are missing. Where are the references for the database? Why include Usercontrol references in the book when even the Winsock control is not covered? The source code examples in the CD are next to useless. Why call this book the #1 Definitive Master reference???? I want my money back.
1	malts for my son: Just the right mallets at a good price. Could not find any locally so Amazon was the next best place to easily find them.
1	Reflective Tape: The product seems to work as suggested! I received it on time and I'm very happy with it's application.Thankschris
1	Safety first... and second...: Great product. Used it to make a few things just a bit more safe as well as to cover faux chrome making it not only black but reflective as well.
0	It just wouldn't run: My hw is overkill for the game. It seemed to install just fine. And then it just wouldn't run. Click on the icon and nothing happened. There was no help anywhere for it. I checked all the "fixes" online and nothing worked. I've worked for VAR's troubleshooting PC's for a living and I couldn't get it to run. I'd give it0 stars if I could.
0	Don't bother unless you prefer single player: If you enjoy single player only, then it's a great game.However if you intended to play multiplayer, don't bother.The server has been down repeatedly. The game gives you "xp" , or experience points, which decides which level Home City you have.At this point in time, if you're one of the lucky ones, you will receive the xp you have earned, most of us however, haven't received our xp.Under the chat browser, there are chat rooms listed that promise ways to fix the xp problem, however the ES people then say there is no way to fix them, yet they leave the chat rooms so people remain confused.There are only a few hundred people average on the server, the most it's hit is probably1,110, while early morning US hours, there are usually around 30-40 people...If ES can't handle so few people, what are they going to do when more people try to join?
0	Bad graphics: I still play AOE1 because the graphics are so simple it doesnt hert your eyes to play it for hours. I didnt like the graphics in AOE 2, and after reading all these reviews I dont think i will buy AOE 3. I advise AOE team to make it simple, but fun. (for example dont use green but light brown in the background
0	Age of Empires III: We were never able to use the game, because it is not compatible with most computers. check your computer specification before buy it.
0	Not ready for prime time: I have a 4 GHz machine with 2 Mb of RAM and GeForce4 graphics card. I have no difficulty running lots of games at high resolution. But this game runs so slowly that it is unplayable -- even at the default screen resolution (1024x800).That resolution is another problem. I have a 21" plasma monitor so anything less than1600x1200 resolution is blurry. When I tried to use1600x1200 it was so slow that I thought it had crashed.In addition the screen scrolling is almost impossible to use because it is so jerky and delayed.
0	Age of Empires III: I can not get it to work on my windows XP or Windows 7 machines. It arrived quickly and in good shape.
0	Just a big let down: I've loved AOE since the first installment and had been looking forward to AOE 3 for years. Unfortunately it turns out to be a huge dissapointment. Everyone else has mentioned the bugs and ridiculous system requirements to get the game working properly but these aside, the gameplay is just truly awful. I AOE 2, you could build a large, realistic looking and balanced army, in AOE 3 its just a rabble of very similar units that are impossible to organise. The maps are too small, the explorer unit is just plain pointless, resource gathering is not what it used to be and the trading posts are annoying to say the least. The main strength of AOE 2 was that it was open to multiple different types of play, from rushers, to stay at home economy builders, but in AOE 3 you have one set way to play and if you don't do it you lose.Overall, although not quite as much of a let down as Championship Manager 5, I'd strongly advise you steer well clear of this.
1	Great small space BBQ!: This grill is great for small spaces. We live in a condo in NYC and it is perfect for the tiny area we get to call our "patio". We love to grill and this gives us delicious dinners without taking up cruical square footage. Very even heat, easy, user-friendly design. I highly suggest it!
1	Long term winner!: I have just sold my Patio Caddy after10 YEARS! I worked famously during that entire time and it still works as good as it did when it was new. The electronic ignition never failed to work. And CharBroil still sells them. Does that tell you something? We only sold it because we wanted a larger unit, no other reason. Get one - you won't be sorry.
1	Can't live without it!: I've owned the same Patio Caddie for over10 years now! It grills beautifully over clay briquettes, giving that great smoke flavor and does it all on a fraction of the propane. The key to getting lots of heat from a tiny burner is cooking COVERED. I even bought a kit to retrofit the burner plate and made the old grill like new again for $20!It's a small grill, but will cook six large steaks all at once.
1	IGBY- the european version: The soundtrack album is actualy a european version where the music in the movie is slightly different. It's an excellent compilation including Travis`version of "the weight" and europe's most recent rock breakout "underwater circus"! Higly recommendable.
1	Windows 98 Annoyances: This is the first "Tech manual" that I have read from cover to cover. It is jammed packed with helpful hints and fixes for Windows 98. Whenever the people at work have a question about Windows 98 we delve into Windows 98 Annoyances and lo-and-behold there is the answer. I have also recommended it to the ZDU SmartPlanet Class I am currently enrolled in. Windows 98 Installation and Support Part I. This book is a must for the beginner and even the intermediate Windows user.
0	The Dutiful Rake: Harriet Klausner summarized the plot so I won't do that here, but her 5-star review is way off. I will say this novel had such a nice beginning. A spirited and independent heroine, and a masculine but not overly domineering hero who was attracted to the heroine without really wanting to be. Well, all that burnt out real quick, and the heroine somehow became timid, and easily led into stupid situations, while the hero became thick-headed and unreasonable.I don't like novels where it's obvious that just a simple conversation between the two main characters will clear the air and resolve their differences -- and they never have that conversation until the last five pages of the book. (Sigh.) This is not a horribly bad story, and it's not badly written, but I got more and more annoyed with the plot and with the characters as I read on. I just think Ms. Rolls is capable of much better storytelling than this.
1	Good Choice of Episodes: I would love to see this whole series on DVD, but was happy to get just this small amount on one DVD. I watched some Welcome Back Kotter episodes as a kid and even now, as an adult, I think they are just hysterical. Great fun for a small amount of money!
1	Flour: The flour was good, but because of the weight (50 lbs) they could have done a better job in taping the box shut. The box was banged up a bit, only one strip of tape was used.
1	House version of Prince: Jamie is one of the best house artist short of Larry Heard,Joe Smooth ( Joe Welborn )lil louis,Farly,and all the other house artist out of Chicago. This album should have gotten more air play but the company didn't promote it like they should have.I wish he would make another one.
1	very good debut: This is a very relaxed but also danceable soul album. Jamie has a wonderful smooth voice. He is accompanied by Kym Sims and Chantay Savage on this album. It's a very good and smooth album
0	Bad Mug: I got this and loved the ergonomics. Great feel, size and balance. I was bitterly disappointed that after one cycle in the dishwasher, the top malfunctioned. The mug has a twisting/locking sealing mechanism and the heat from the dishwasher must have expanded it. Now it will not pour at all. Please note, this was not a 'special cycle' or high temp wash, just normal dishwasher and the thing is ruined. I also ruined a pair of pants yesterday when I couldn't figure out why I could not sip and them coffee came running out the side.My only saving grace is that I figured this out before I went and bought more. BAD PRODUCT DO NOT BUY
1	Rare and curious relic: Spade Cooley was not your typical B Western "hero". The cowboy movies where he played the lead character seemed like a parody or even a satirical commentary (intentionally or not) on B singing cowboys of that period. This Alpha DVD contains two of his rare three movies where he played lead. Alpha obtained somewhat passable to good copies of prints and released these in DVD. Despite all, Cooley can sing and his western songs have the bounce that Autry's or Rogers' do not have. Unlike the two, Cooley's personal life took a tumble later in his carrer when he was convicted of killing his wife. You'd never expect it from the soft spoken cowboy hero you see on the screen.
0	Spade digs a hole: This video is for B Western buffs only. Spade Cooley, who was a great fiddle player and band leader, produced some of his own pictures including these. They make B Westerns look like the production values of Gone With The Wind. However, he was one of the very few B Western stars that filled his movies with humor. They are comedies with Spade as the butt of the joke. He looks a bit like a shorter wider Roy Rogers, but unfortunately that's where any semblance to acting ends. I had fun watching these and remembering my childhood, but if you are looking for good B Westerns, pass on this.
0	very disapointed: I realize that this isn't an expensive item by any means, but I guess I expected something more. It didn't give me what I was looking for, which was close-ups of countries, with cities listed. The closer I went in, the fewer pixels there were, making everthing blurry. Maybe I was expecting too much ...
1	***** You want to be MCSE, buy it now with Core In Nutshell: This book is not for the beginner to start learning the product. However, if you are just quite familiar with them, this one is the best summarized book. You will find out that there are many things you don't really know, then you go back to try, you will know. Tell you in more detail, I chose TCP/IP and Proxy as my electives. TCP/IP is okay, but Proxy is not that easy, after you read the book, you should try the server again. Anyway, I have to say loudly that I can pass MCSE in 2 weeks because of this ELEPHANT book and its companion Core In Nutshell. Don't forget to buy both of them, Core in Nutshell and Elective in Nutshell. GOOD BOOK DOES NOT NEEDED TO BE THICK. If it's possible, could the writer write MCSD in Nutshell, please?
1	great introduction and reveiw of topics: At this point I have only read the TCP/IP and IIS 4.0 sections, but I found them very helpful giving a good general overview of the topics. I then used CBT courseware for more detailed information. A couple of hours before a taking a test I also reveiwed by reading through the specific test section. The section in TCP/IP on subnet masking was the best explanation I have ever read, with instruction for creating and understanding the subnetting chart fantastic, making it easy to create and then answer subnetting questions accurately on the tcp/ip test. The book does not get five stars, because it can only supplement other study material.
1	blast from the past: Uncertain at first but just wanted see how it went. For those who know the Grand Canyon must be fascinating. I would think it a must-have for those exploring this area.
1	Hey: Hey, Its Zane Grey,what can you say. No matter how much alike they are,Zane Grey always produces interesting reading. Lots of lessons to be learned.
1	20 minutes to warm up your day!: This is a great warm-up or a mini work out!Breathwork is a focus throughout, while upper and lower body are being worked at the same time, bringing balance to mind, body, and spirit.Whenever I am not feelng motivated I can pop in Zen Yoga Daily Warm-Up DVD, move along with Aaron's instruction, and I am ready to go!
0	Great Initially, major fail after time passes...: We first got this grill 3 years ago (may08). At the time the legs were stable the cooking temp could reach 500-600 without difficulty. By the next summer the legs started getting weak. The liner under the lid needed constant cleaning and most importantly the temp would barely break 450. Then last summer came along and the grill just refused to get hot. I took apart the heating element and was aghast at what I saw. The entire encasement was one big blob of plastic. The whole thing was melted to pieces. You would think the designers wouldn't use plastic so close to the heat! I will not buy a replacement part or buy a new grill until I hear that charbroil has addressed these issues.
0	2010 Char-Broil Bust!!!: Had this grill for three years. It worked great until summer 2009. Thermostat burned and melted where it connects to broiler element. Char-broil customer service gladly sold me a new one - total with shipping $60.00. First time I plugged it in - which was 2 months after I received it - it melted and burned just like the first. Char-broil customer service wanted to sell me another since their parts only have a 30 day warranty. As a one time good deal customer service sent me a replacement with free return shipping of the newly burned out controller. This replacement of the replacement burned and melted just as the other two had done. However, now Char-broil won't return phone calls and ignores my emails. No response to three emails and three phone calls. Don't buy this Char-broil electric grill. It was a good product two years ago but the 2009 and later components are defective and cheap. Find a different brand. I am going to Weber grills.
0	Electric is nice, but some major problems: I've had two of these grills. The first I replaced because it was starting to rust (despite being covered) -- I had no major problems with that one, the second I've only had for six months. The second grill has melted around the heating element, which seems to be a fire hazard. I was quite suprised.In addition, the thermostats on these grills have gotten worse than with the original model -- it seems at least100 degrees off. The fire safety, not including the briquettes and a jacked up price should probably make one look for other options, if only there were other quality options.
0	Does not sear steaks: This grill will work only as a baker and not as a hot grill that will sear steaks. It preheats after 30 minutes to about 375 degrees and the temperature drops significantly when meat is added. This is certainly not the temperature published in the manual. It is not satisfactory for my needs.
1	the best grill that i own: I own three bbq grills .A propane grillcharcol grill and the electric patio caddie.The patio caddie which I use on my deck has forced the other two grills into storage.The electric grill heats up to about 700 degrees in15 to 20 minutes and cooks burgers in10 minutes franks in 8 minutes and chicken in about18 minutes.It is easy to assemble and use.It is by far the best piece of hardware that I have ever bbq'ed on.ps. I intend to use this grill throughout the winter for tailgate parties at home.
0	Total Waste Of My Money: When new, this grill did not get hot enough to sear the juices into the meat, which is what a good grill will do. Also, there was very little smoke flavor imparted to the meat. It was like grilling in the kitchen stove.The heating element failed after one season, so I invested in a new controller. The new unit worked once, and then failed completely. I have had cheaper electric grills that worked much better and lasted much longer.I do not recommend.
0	DON'T BUY: I've had this grill for a little over a year. I paid $189 for it. It worked like a champ for ONE SUMMER, now the controller is bad. Char-Broil tells me that it'll cost $90 to replace. Although I like the features of an elctric grill, fast heat and all, if you make such a CRAPPY unit that it doesn't last long and you don't stand behind it...I say I'll NEVER buy another Char Broil product again!
0	lousy design...: I am now on my 3rd Char-Broil patio caddie! They've each lasted 2 years and then the plastic control knob melts! What kind of design do they have? Then again, I guess I need to stop ordering the grill, thinking they've improved the design. WHY would any engineer place a PLASTIC KNOB anywhere near 400-500 degree metal???? WHY??? I like the look of the new stainless steel version, but WILL NOT buy another until they design a control knob that won't melt!!! PLASTIC on HOT metal???? C'mon Char-Broil....get with the program and TEST your own grills!Don't buy if you're expecting this grill to last more than a couple of seasons.Also, a HINGED LID would be a real bonus, too!
0	Awkward start: Ocean Colour Scene are absolutely brilliant. It is amazing to me that they are virtually unknown here in the States. They write, sing and play beautifully. They are always well produced but never over produced. This however is unlike anything else they have released. It is an awkward beginning at best. The songs show promise and that promise was realized in their subsequent releases. Where the performances are solid, the production sinks the recording. It is dated, slick and just a poor fit for the band's sound. If you must have them all, you will end up buying this. Otherwise, get any of the other releases they are far superior and all terrific. This is just not an essential recording.
1	Great compressor!: This is a great compressor, it has pently of power to drive brads and finish nails.
1	Great music performed extraordinarily well: My introducation to the music of Dmitri Kabalewsky was through the old Horowitz recordings of the 3rd sonata (both live and studio version) and some of the preludes. The music here is not as phantasmagoric as Scriabin, not as lush as Rachmaninov, and certainly not as "modern" as Prokofiev. Yet Kabalewsky is very original and falls within the Romantic range of Russian pianism. His music evokes various moods that might remind one of Prokofiev but there also seems to be an element of the fantasy there as well, especially in the preludes. The Sonatas are tight pieces well worth frequent performances on today's concert stage. The pianist, Wolfram Schmitt-Leonardy, is excellent with this music and plays it to the hilt. The sound and recording quality is very good as well. In all, a worth while CD for pianophiles looking for something new and good.
1	Hot stuff -- an inspiration for writers!: This is an excellent book about a man who knows who he is, dreams of what he might be, and works his butt off to make the near-impossible real.It's a great book for struggling writers to read because Larry Brown came from nowhere to become one of the great writers of his generation and he did it on the strength of his will alone.There are passages in this book so lovely they make you catch your breath.
0	Disappointing: This author in no Dennis Smith. I had expected that a majority of the book would involve the author's professional life and his experiences. What I got was a tiresome narrative mainly about his personal life. Who really cares that he had a deer in his gunsight, thinking "This is the most beautiful thing I have ever seen.", before he kills it. Or all the time he spends drinking beer. There's more but I prefer to just forget the whole regretable experience.
1	Reading ON FIRE not a waste of time: ON FIRE is not a book about firefighting; it is a book about a man's life who also happens to be a firefighter. Brown is a regular guy who worked hard to become a writer, not because he didn't want to be a firefighter, but because he thought he could do something else to contribute to others, doing work as a writer.I think the book is very good. I do not think the book is great. I think the book is worth reading, but I also think if you want to learn more about firefighting there are probably better books out there. Still, I think the book was not a waste of time, as some other reviewers thought it was.
1	Landscape of the Heart: WINTER PASSING is visually beautiful with skillful acting and slow-paced story telling. The lives portrayed are barren as a winter landscape, rife with drug and alcohol abuse, casual sex, self-injury, suicide attempted and suicide succeeded...in their attempts to block out lonliness and disappointment.These lives are groping towards meaning and find it in the search for a redefinition of family, after Reese's rocky homecoming leads to a measure of reunion and reconciliation.The ending is a bit too neat after the messiness we've been privy to. But, the film is worth watching and considering for it's complex interactions among the four characters in the Michigan scenes as they search for some new way, any way, out of a hard winter's landscape.--Janet Grace Riehl, author Sightlines: A Poet's Diary
1	Uplifting and Inspirational!: I purchased the CD as a means of introduction for our kids to christian music. The worship songs are upbeat and spiritually uplifting. Its a fantastic CD and I recommended it highly. It would make a great addition to your current musical collection and an even better gift to a friend. I love it!
1	SIRIUS - SIGNAL KIT: I had problems with indoor receptions with Sirius boom box external antenna so I bought this. It works very well so now I have excellent reception indoors. I installed it with the splitter for standard Satellite not HD and it works well this way I don't know how well it would affect HD reception for the TV if at all. I am very pleased with this unit.
1	This is the best book in the world: Mr. Poppers Penguin is the best book. The author is Richard and Florence Atwater. This is a Newbery Honor book. It is great for all ages because it is the funniest book in the world. My favorite part is when the penguins live in the freezer. The characters are Mr. Popper, Mrs. Popper, Admiral Drake, Mr. Greenbaum, Mr. Klein, Janie Popper and Bill Popper. The Penguins are Caption Cook, Greta, Columbus, Victoria, Nelson, Jenny, Magellan, Scott, Isabella, Ferdinand and Louisa. Hope you read this book.
1	Wonderful Book: I took a University class were The Story of Judaism, third,augmented edtion, by Bernard J. Bamberger was used as the textbook. The book was well orginized, enjoyable to read, and very comprehensive. It added a large amount of historical facts to my religous knowledge. It was well recieved by both the Jewish and non-Jewish students.
1	What can I say?: This was a GREAT find. First bought the vinyl back in the 80's and snagged the disc quite some time ago. Ray signed the cover in 2002 @ the Rock & Roll Hall Of Fame in Cleveland, Ohio
1	Sturdy grater: This product took a while coming, but it is completely satisfactory. Heavier than most drum graters, it offers the possibility of a longer life.
0	When in trouble, break glass: First off, if you are going to write this genre, then recognize that there are people out there who know weapons, know the law and know unarmed combat. This books fails in all of those details.It is not that it is poorly written, but we have your basic corrupt republican administartion interested in buying bullets and expanding the "evil" military. They want to keep a terrible secret from getting loose.Then there is a cold blooded assassin, who starts out good, but makes dumb mistake after dumb mistake.There is the idealistic jornalist that starts running for her life around page 200.And the billionaire bad guys and biillionaire good guys. I'm sure this novel appealed to the New York publishing establishment's world view--does the word cliche mean anything?Finally, when we have a chance for an interesting ending, the author pulls a rabbit out of the hat to make everything better.This plot was terribly predictable.
0	Disappointing: I read a lot of thrillers, and this debut by Casey Moreton disappointed me. As a previous reviewer pointed out, there is very little in this plot that is original or suspenseful. It is instead consists of elements recycled from a lot of previous thrillers -- a corrupt President, a reformed hit-man, a father looking for his lost daughter, etc.The most problematic aspect of this book is the lack of a central character. The author keeps jumping around from person to person, changing narrative perspectives. I therefore had no idea who the "hero" of this novel was supposed to be. To me, it's hard to write a good suspense novel unless you have a sympathetic central character, and there really isn't one in this novel.If you like suspense novels, I recommend reading Harlan Coben or CJ Box instead.
1	BEST CD I BOUGHT ALL YEAR!: The review that prompted me to buy this CD called it "an embarassment of riches" and it is an understatement.Every song is a joy. During the first listen I waited eagerly when the changer switched to the next tune. You never know what is going to greet you next. Big band, salsa, gorgeous ballads. They are all here. With a voice that can be soft and beguiling one minute and powerhouse the next, I was completed shocked that I'd never heard of this singer. The arrangements are so rich you'd expect to hear these musicians backing Streisand or Eder. And the extra surprise of getting a duet with Susan Egan (I'm a big fan), with both of them belting out their gospel best. Why has this woman not yet been on Broadway?This was my first listen to Lisa Richard, and I will go back now and buy every recording she has ever made.
0	worth product i never got from Amazon website before: i ordered this book on june14, i didn't get the item till amonth later. The shipping suck. finally, i got the book after my school already start, it was too late for my class. It's totally bad quality differ from what the seller detail. Bad Service, bad product. never buy anything from the seller again.
1	perfect: Perfect on my Sony blu-ray, 4 year old daughter enjoys it, probably just buy it considering the price to rent it...
1	Lauras Review!! GO ME: well...I havent seen this movie in a while but its one of my favourite movies of all time...Its great! The songs are amazing, the graphics are remarkable and the whole movie is perfection. Tim Burton is a Genious!! I love this movie...I had it when i was little and I watched it all the time...Thats why I want the DVD
1	Classic Tim Burton: What can I say, but BRAVO! A stop-motion picture of this calibur will NEVER be topped. Definitely an inventive way of visualizing holidays. Tim Burtons visions artistically come to life in this dark christmas tale. Great Job!
1	Nightmare before Christmas: Tim Burton does it again! I don't know why it is listed as a Christmas movie, I would think more of a Halloween movie, could be both I suppose. Awesome!!!
1	My favorite movie: This is a great movie with incredible stop motion animation. The story is fantastic, my kids love it, they watch it all the time
0	nightmare before christmas: Let me start by saying it took over 5 weeks to deliver, upon delivery my Granddaughter was extremly overjoyed. Until i tried to play the dvd, come to find out the movie will not play in the U.S.A. Not only is my Granddaughter upset i am realy pissed, This purchase was a waste of money and time.
1	Very Happy with purchase.: The item was the same as what it was described as. Great value for the money with the Special Edition!
1	Twisted, different, fun: Tim Burton's worldview isn't quite like anyone else's, but that's what makes "Nightmare Before Christmas" such a treat. Jack Skellington, the Pumpkin King, is tired of Halloween. He kidnaps Santa, thinking he can do a better job and ends up creating the halloweeniest Christmas ever. Some sensitive kids and adults may be disturbed by the imagery and the fun Burton pokes at the holiday. Definitely for more mature children only.
1	Great movie great condition: Movie arrived before estimated day and is in great shape for being used. Will use this company for my dvd needs in the future.
1	A charming Mexican Romantic Comedy: Anyone who has any familarity with Mexican culture will immediately identify with this movie. The son who does his mother's bidding no matter what. The young woman who marries to escape the constrictions of the family. The closeted nature of gay life in Mexico. The mother who works to make sure her son is happy as well as presents the proper appearance in society. Someone from the United States might wonder what all the fuss is about. But the movie touches on the Mexican world view and gay people in a compassionate manner for the time. A good training manual for any gringo who decides to involve himself with a Mexican male.
0	Terrible product quality and service: Ordered a 2 pack, only received a single pillow...which upon being filled the first time, found it leaked terribly. Best I could get was a1/2 refund for the one that never arrived since the leaking pillow was "used". So much for consumer protection and refunds for defective products. Do not buy ANYTHING from this company, especially this product, unless you want to lose your money. You'd have better odds at Vegas getting your money back.
1	So far, happy: The only flaw is that it is HEAVY and cold on the bottom. Otherwise, I seem to be sleeping pretty well with it. No leaking problems as others stated.
0	Imac Crap: This book is useless. Anyone with10 minutes may sit at an Apple computer and learn more hands on than the hour or two wasted reading this book. The other reviews here re: iMac Fast and Easy are very misleading... probably written by someone with interests other than yours.
0	Yuck!: a spaghetti western at its worst. Mistook the film for the new Django and what a mistake it was. Thankfully, it was only a rental. Never bothered beyond the first ten minutes.
0	A Mess: I have read this book cover to cover (with my highlighter and pencil at the ready) and I've never been more frustrated in all my life. I work with Word everyday and am looking to automate documents and I can make no sense out of any of it. (Of course, there is a strong possibility that I'm stupid and in over my head - but if you think you're going to learn to create templates and fill-in forms and learn to use If-then-else fields, etc., well, I missed it.)
0	It was alright...: While listening to Sleepy Brown's album, I was amped to hear some smooth groves and soul. I was pondering on whether I would buy it while I bobbed my head to the music video for "Margarita" because I liked that song a lot. But while I listened to the album, I noticed that it remained even throughout. There was never a bad song or a really great song. It was at a steady pace the entire time, sort of like listening to Sade or someone of that nature. When "Underwater Love" came on, I was pleasantly surprised that he did have one head bobber that made me want to dance, but other than that, the album was at a medium pace. I don't love it. I don't hate it. I'm just indifferent about it. I would replay "Underwater Love" in heavy rotation, but I'm not sure I'll buy it.
0	didn't work for me: used about 3 of these over a two year period, although in partly shaded places, and never caught any YJs. The reusable rescue trap(which I guess i am having trouble finding in stores now) worked fairly well. I did use water as per instructions, however. did not try the apple juice thing.Guess people don't find this review helpful, that is OK. There might be regional differences or other poorly understood factors. Just my experience with the product. The YJ problem is so bad around our property(especially after mild winter) got stung several times this year and personally destroyed 2 underground nests, yet they are still around. Have heard they can forage for a quarter of a mile away. We live in one of the Gulf Coast states and maybe that is a factor. Maybe our YJs are smarter than the ones in other places, who knows. I have to try this again but will use apple juice mixture this time.
0	Terrible: How did this product even get1 good review? Terrible, sat right next to a whole swarm practically that was coming to my pool to drink water every day. After 7 days, it caught NOTHING. Took it down and tossed in the trash. DO NOT BUY THIS, you will be disappointed.
0	Don't catch Yellow Jackets: Their old attractant caught TONS of yellow jackets so I am experienced with this trap. The white attractant has not caught anything except a few flies and crickets. The company is great however and has agreed to work with me if I continue to be dis-satisfied. I am giving it one more try and using apple juice this time instead of water.
1	Always works: I am big fan of Irwin Naturals Ginkgo and been using it for years. My wife uses a lot of there brands as well.
0	Not a good everyday supplement: I rated this item one star since I had bad experience with taking it and withdrawal effects.The Ginko part is great, but it has L-Dopa which is precursor to dopamine , a major neurotransmitter in the brain. taking this supplement regularly will make you sleepy and if you stop it suddenly will cause depression symptoms.Please read more about the supplements content before buying any.
0	ugh!: The plot is corny and unrealistic. The characters couldn't be more transparent if they were glass. Definitely a waste of time...unless you want to get a few good laughs at the author's unintentionally humorous style.
0	no: I didn't like this book because it was as true to life as advertised on the back of the book. I think agent Night's character should learn to talk like a real person.
1	Lust for Danger blew me away!: I was thrilled with this book! My only regret was that it ended. Fast-paced, exciting, human characters...visual...great dialogue, exotic and well researched locations...I can't say enough! I hope there are more Agent Night adventures in store for us. It was so refreshing to read Lust for Danger, definitely brought my appetite back for a good story!
1	Top notch movie: Have enjoyed this movie for years. Don`t know why I had not bought it before.The Sweeny Todd performance is the greatest.Sure beats "Memories" from Cats.
0	Pretty Lame: I thought this movie was pretty bad. It was SO easy to predict. Liv Tyler's role was so small, I think she is a lovely actress, who made a bad choice to work in such a cheesy movie.Ben Affleck may be fabulous eye candy, but I must say, his acting abilities are lacking substance.Overall, I would skip this one all together. Even as a rental.
0	Good story idea, but carried out in a bad way: The basic idea of this story is good: a father learning how to raise his daughter while also trying to cope with the loss of his wife and the fact that his daughter's birth caused his wife's death. What could have been great was botched, however. There was too much profanity. I find it in very bad taste to use profanity in front of children. I also found there to be too much sex in the movie. They could have developed the plot without that. I did like the Will Smith side jokes in there, however.
0	Garbage: Poor acting all around, Horrible storyline. Do yourself a favor and pass this one up. You'll thank me.
1	I don't care I enjoyed this movie!: Being a father and also being a Kevin SMith fan, this movie was easy to connect with, I also have a daughter and a big ambition to make movies, it is also something that gets in the way of being a dad. A great movie.
1	Extra Questions for the Test!: This series contains a quick review of each exam objective and a large array of questions per objective.The questions are relatively similar to those on the test and will at least give you an idea of where you need to brush up.I would reccomend this book along with any of the Coriolis or Syngress MCSE series.
1	I'm learning a lot!!: I really didn't even use the cd's for two weeks, just the book and it's been marvelous. My boyfriend is Hispanic and I felt the need to be able to at least recognize a few words of Spanish. Once I started to use the cd's everything came so quickly. Como se dice FANTASTIC in espanol!!!!
0	This is a waste of money: This CD set was a complete letdown. [...] the CD case is cheap. You open it, and the CDs fall out. The CDs are clearly just made in a CD burner.What's worse is the content. You will NOT learn Spanish through this program. I studied Spanish in college, and I know this is nowhere near a complete course. It doesn't bother teaching the past tense! You learn just the present tense and a tiny, tiny bit of the future tense.The Spanish speaker is excellent, I must say, but the English speaker [...]will put you to sleep. He reads like a robot: "O...K...Luis....now...we...will...dis...cuss...the ..numbers...in...span...ish." BORING! Nothing is tied together--it's just a bunch of random commentary thrown out at you.I'm sure there are much better courses available.
0	[aweful]: This is probably the most ill-formed book in general I have ever read, not to mention the worst grow book, period. The illustrations are CHEESY.The photographs are of poor quality, you can barely discern them. The information is general, contradictory, unorganized... I wouln't trust a thing in it, which is strange because Jorge Cervantes is a genius, and his previous publications prove his skill. But this book is a no-no. Go for another, and don't be afraid to spend the bucks. You want climate matched with plant variety with specific feeding instructions, and plenty of do's and dont's. If your info is poor then your fruit will suffer.
1	Nice, well built darts: I got these after my less than stellar experience with the Viper Black Mariah's. These throw better, feel better and are built much better. Overall it was a wiser investment for a casual dart player like myself.
0	Dreadful: Bought this item based on the positive reviews. I bought 3 and followed the directions. Not only did this trap not catch any flies, the smell was dreadful. At first we thought we had a dead mouse in the wall. The smell is that bad. We threw them out. This trap was a waste of money and time.
0	Works well, but the smell is intolerable: I put one in the garage and another by the trash cans. Over1 weeks they both collected about 20 flies each, but the smell was so bad I had to remove them from any where around the house, I now have them in the back of the yard where they continue to work, but the flys are still getting in the house... too bad!
1	These are great fly traps!: THis is the second order of these fly traps. We tried a locally available fly trap after the first order was completely full of flies but the other brand just didn't do the job so we reordered these to use in our horse barn. These are WONDERFUL. Within minutes of hanging them, the flies started collecting. We hang them just over head level at each of the entrances to the barn and the arena and they do a superb job of ridding the barn of pesky flys that annoy our stallions.
1	Highly Recommend: This fly trap really works well. I hung the fly trap in our cherry blossom tree which is located close to our trash cans and our huge pigeon cage. This time of year the Cherry Blossom tree is dropping cherries and with the high temp heat, they almost splatter when they hit the ground...the flies love this...plus we have a dog. So needless to say we have flies everywhere and I hate them. The flytrap has been hanging for two weeks and there are hundreds of flies in this thing. Especially during the hot afternoon it is swarming with flies, I have noticed a significant difference in the number of flies. They used to be all over the grass, all over the trash cans, The fly trap has made a big difference. Don't get me wrong we still have flies...but not like before. Every couple of days you have to make sure to check your trap to see if you need to add water to it, so the water stays at the fill line. I ended up buying this flytrap at Lowes.
0	Either I've attracted Highly Evolved Flies, or this is100% Rubbish: Are there a lot of flies near this? Yes.Have practically any flies been caught by this stupifyingly piece of useless rubbish? No.Review complete.
0	SAVE YOUR MONEY!!: We had a cook out in our back yard and we hung this up on the deck about 5 feet away from the table and not one fly went for this thing as they were all in our food!! As soon as we cleared the food from the table, then they went for this trap so this did not work for the intentions that I bought it for, which was so the flies to stay away from our food!
1	Fly control: This thing is amazing, I got one after seeing it in action at a friends house. WARNING Be sure not to spill any of the contents what so ever, mine fell off the tree I had it up in and months later I still smell the bait in that area and it smells like death.
1	The one that Works: I purchased this product last Fall on a close out sale at a huge national retailer. It worked perfectly. This year I returned to the same retailer in July and they had sold out of the Rescue Brand Fly Traps and didn't plan on restocking until next year. They talked me into purchasing another brand. Needless to say the other brand didn't work. We live next to a cattle pasture and the flies are outrageous near our home. I hung the "other" brand fly trap on the fence between the pasture and my driveway and a week later there were a few flies in the trap. I ordered the Rescue Brand Fly Trap from Amazon and hung 3 of them on the same fence. 3 days later I had to replace the Rescue Brand TrapsRESCUE! FTD-DT12 Disposable Fly Trapbecause they were FULL OF FLIES. I will not use another brand trap because I am not a wealthy person and cannot waste money. The Rescue brand Fly is the one that works. Don't waste your time or money with any other brand.
0	First 3 songs good then...a little disapoointing: When I head "Shining Light" I thought this was going to be real find. When I bought this CD, I was let down a little. The first things (including Shining Light) are very catchy and good. But, from then on, the CD just goes into gradual mediocrity. Oh well, I guess I still think Shining Light is a great song with great words.
0	OUTRAGEOUS price!: Why are they so expensive here? At least twice the price that they normally are at a drugstore! I love Amazon, but it drives me crazy when they jack the price up on random items. I thought I was supposed to get a the best price here.
1	One of the best entertainment book: I have read many, many books on Hollywood and auto/biographies in general and this book ranks as one of the best ever. It is a very entertaining book that doubles as a great history of Hollywood through its golden age. Capra interacted with Hollywood's legends and reports in a funny, candid and emotional way his dealings with the likes of Harry Cohn, Sinatra, Disney, Monroe and many more stars of the thirties and forties. Do not think the book is dated: yes, some of the names are meaningless to us today but the perspetive and lessons contained in every single page are timeless. this book tells you better than any others how movies are made or should be made...
1	ONE OF THE FUNNIEST MOVIES OF THE 90'S!: THIS IS BY FAR MIKE MYER'S BEST MOVIE! DANA CARVEY AND MYERS LIGHT UP THE SCREEN LIKE NO OTHER COUPLE. THE SCRIPT IS BRILLIANT FUNNY AND COMPLETELY ADDICTIVE. WHAT DO I MEAN? AFTER YOU SEE THIS FILM YOU PICK UP LINES LIKE EXSQUEEZE ME? AND BAKING POWDER? GET IT? ANYWAY, GREAT MOVIE AND GREAT CULT-LIKE SCRIPT! MYERS IS A TRUELY GREAT COMIC. BUY THIS MOVIE, YOU DEFINITELY WON'T REGRET IT!
1	Squeeze me? Baking Powder?: If you grew up watching Mike Myers on SNL, you'll appreciate this movie. Not great but funny enough to make you chuckle.
1	AGE3: I have been a fan of this series from the beginning and it has only gotten better with time and later versions. The latest version takes place in a time period with great significance and has always drawn me in. The graphics are great, as long as your computer is equipped to handle them. I started playing on an older computer which locked up during ship battles and such. However, with a newer comp I enjoy full game play. Maybe there were some bugs in the software initially, but I have never had a problem outside of processor speed. Great game, 5 stars.
0	There's no commentary, I expected more.: I wanted to know more about what John has to say. But, there's no commentary, only fill in the comments yourself. I can do that with my bible. A good buy but, not what I expected.
1	An apt title for retro-loving film buffs: This is a great collection of Burlesque shorts. The "features" are not entirely worth watching. Every element of the classic grindhouse atmosphere is recorded--the gritty backdrops, the corny comics, the jaded stripteasers, and even some hilarious musicians having trouble keeping their eyes on the instruments!Even if you aren't planning on watching every short in this two-disc set, it is a great purchase anyways. I have even used this as a sort of conversation piece/ambiance in some interesting parties. The interview of Lili St. Cyr in the liner is also well worth reading.Enjoy the lost art form of Burlesque!!!
0	B at best: I did not make it very far through this movie. Even if you think Jenny is attractive (she's not) then you still shouldn't watch this movie. Thankfully amazon prime gives it to us for free.
0	Dreadfully Unfunny: This was a movie recommended to me by a friend. I turned it off after seeing a fish imbedded in the lower orifice of one of Jenny's dates. He yells, "Touch my bass!" over and over. Need I say more? OK, how about the earlier scene where another of Jenny's dates throws up on her breasts? One of the worst movies of the decade.
1	if u have an off beat sense of humor you'll love it!: In this movie jenny mccarthy stars as rebecca who is dating a typical model who is more in love with himself then her. This movie is not for people who find typical things funny. Everything from her break down on the hollywood strip to finding her boyfriend cheating on her are things that women encounter. I mean the whole part where she goes richard my richard and then starts to cry and then stops calms herself then thinks about the situation again. classic. ive done that although not on the street. and when she walks in on her boyfriend and doesnt say anything my friend did the same thing. everyone has that white ghetto friend. everyone has that ditsy friend. all the stereotypes were done to the extreme and thats what makes it so great and really funny. you cant take this movie seriously and you shouldnt try to. Just enjoy it!
0	terrible: Why did I waste my time watching this movie? It was on the first page of popular picks. It was beyond bad.
0	Aren't there any negative stars?: This was a total waste of time. Bad acting, worse plot, the most intelligent part is the screams of OMG. Not worth the money that you don't pay for it.
0	pure cra*: This is the first movie review I have ever provided and I write it only to save any other person out there a bit of your life. Skip this movie, it is the worst I've seen in my life.
1	Do yourself a favor.... BUY IT!!!!!: I'm owned this cd since it came out and all I can hear is Dave Tregunna kick ass basslines, Andy McCoy's atomic guitar and some major adrenalin ricocheting of off some drummer I never even heard of until I brought this cd.... THE BASSLINES KICKASS ON THIS ALBUM!!!! Dave is a very underated bassist who not only plays very creative basslines but is also able to sing some great backups as well and I needn't say anything about Andy his playin speaks for itself. Billy's voice is fine. So what he doesn't tend to take one direction when he sings. I happen to like that about him. There isn't a bad song on this album. DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND BUY THIS CD!
0	worth a rent, but that's it: I was looking forward to seeing this movie after the write ups I had read about it. I must admit I was highly disappointed. The acting was good, but it was such a cliche storyline. Repressive husband, wife gets tired of it and starts to look for more. I guess I just didn't think it original. I didn't care for the lines or the chemistry between the cast.
0	Poor anti-war movie: I am trying to decide if I am going to throw this DVD away. I watched the whole movie. It was the toughest sit through since "Mosquito Coast" with Harrison Ford. I do not mind watching a movie that is making the case that war is bad...war is bad, even though sometimes it is necessary. However, the movie itself jumped all over the place. As another review said, the relationships were poorly built. At first the animated portions of the film were interesting in an artsy way, but they kept coming back and were over used. The battle/war itself should have been more focused upon. The Crimean War was badly fought and this could have been a much better movie if it had shown the poor quality of generalship on both sides instead of just showing the character of the British and French generals.
1	Pretty Good: I have the Night Before Halloween so I decided to give this book a try. It starts off very good. It fell off to me toward the middle. But, overall still a very funny and entertaining book.
1	Children loved it!: We heard about this book and bought it for our grandchildren, they loved it but so did the adults. It is a funny book!
1	Cute: I like how this book is realistic yet kid friendly. My 3 yr old can relate to almost every page and it teaches him a few new words like "needles" on the tree and "sugar plum" to which he always calls out it's candy! And he laughs when the baby pee pees on Santa. He also likes when the girl says "bad kitty" because our pets are always knocking down ornaments, too. It is almost creepy how close this comes to depicting our family, my husband even came down with the flu, too. Would recommend this for an evening read-aloud with the kids because it is cute for parents too.
1	Loved it: Interesting period piece. Well written... this manuscript won an international competition by Wallace publishing (Chicago) as well as a $10,000 prize for it's author, Jeffrey DePrend (Oscar Prendergast) in1919.
0	bad experience: I thought i was getting a dvd i could view in the USA!Unfortunately it was for viewing in China!I was told i would have to pay for shipping to send it back,wow. This was from MovieMars,beware
1	Excellent Read: I have read this book at least 2 times in the past few months - it is an easy, but very good read that explores lots of concepts and practical steps. Chapter 3 definitely rocks!
1	First Buy: At least this on played on my dvd unlike S2. Really enjoy this series so glad I purchased the series so I can watch it whenever I want to.
0	Build Your Own Pentium III PC: As with most of the "build your own" books on the market, this one is pretty out of date. Also, the book supplies you with very little information which would help you select which components will best meet your needs and which components work best together (ie- which motherboards, video graphics boards ...). Basically this book just explains in very breif detail how the system all works together.The most difficult thing in building your own system IMHO is deciding which components will best meet your needs and will work well together. I did not get any helpful info from this book along these lines. In fact the author does not even seem particularly knowledgeable about the subject matter in the book. I think I could have wrote a better book and I do not even consider myself a computer geek.Bottom line, I waisted my money...
0	Not really that great.: Bought this and "Sterling NFT-D Disposable Fly Control TrapWith Attractant"After a week this Jar had about 50 flies in it.The other, had hundreds.Only downside to the bag working so great is its pretty much already full after 2 weeks and I need a new one.Might just dish out the money for a bug zapper.
0	Not as effective as had hoped... and it REEKS!!!!!: We leave a bowl of food out for our outdoor cats, and it attracts a LOT of flies... this fly trap has helped somewhat, but the results are minimal. The odor from the trap is absolutely horrific and unbearable. If you don't have a bowl of pet food sitting outside, perhaps this trap will work for you (and definitely place it where you won't smell it!).
0	do not buy: Green top does not hold the weight of the water well.Hung mine and yes the lid was on tight.Next thing it fell from green top and was all on the floor.Green plastic top does not hold weight of water at all.
1	Underrated blues/rock band compels musicianship to new level: Much in the spirit of Zeppelin, the Badlands take their smart rock and outline a detailed map of musicianship that easily makes todays Limp Bizkit compost creations, a musty meddle of distasteful whiner garbage. When it's said that this CD is hard to find, there is a duel meaning. Finding a copy to own for yourself may be quite a challenge, but more importantly, a CD of this calibur is hard to find in a world where it's cool to regurgitate already virulent ideas. This CD is more than enough to make the group's cover of James Taylor's "Fire and Rain" a rock n' roll classic.
1	HILARIOUS: IF YOU LIKE PHYSICAL HUMOR AND STEVE CARRELL, THIS IS A WINNER. ANNE HATHAWAY IS GREAT AND ALTHOUGH THIS ISN'T LIKE THE ORIGINAL SERIES, IT DELIVERS THE LAUGHS. MY TEEN SONS ALSO THOUGHT IT WAS FUNNY
0	DIGTAL COPY WILL NOT WORK: A warning that the Digital Copy disc that comes with this Blu-Ray set will no longer work. It "expired" in December 2009 and can no longer be accessed. Just something that should be noted, I think, for anyone buying this Blu-Ray new today.Having purchased it for my son to watch, and wanting to put it on his iPod to do so, was very disappointed that this wasn't known prior to purchase.
1	Funnier than expected: I was pleasantly surprised while watching this movie. The inclusion of The Rock helped decrease the overall dorkie-ness. Lots of fun and right up there with the Austin Powers movies.The Blu-Ray copy looked AMAZING. I did not see a copy of the regular DVD version so I have no real comparison but that aside, it looked crystal clear.
0	Ha-Ha, boy, was this funny?: The main problem with this movie: it was'nt that funny. I think I laughed once, maybe twice. Normally, Steve Carell is very funny; but he had nothing to work with here. Terence Stamp, a great actor, is totally wasted in this punishing film as the main villian, Siegfried. Anne Hathaway was completely forgettable as, er, I forget. And someone please tell Alan Arkin to stop sleeping on the set...oh, he was awake? Could of fooled me..One laugh was generated by Bill Murray, playing Agent13. Besides that, I can't think of much else that made me laugh. This was a comedy? Good points: Nice crisp,clear picture and this was a free rental.
1	Can't be beat: I don't usually like these kinds of movies. I am more of a Disney fan, but for some reason this one really tripped my trigger. I love how it is relatively clean, and has a fun balance between action, adventure and silliness. I pull it out whenever I need a good laugh.
0	taking stupid to a new hight: this movie makes the orignal max smart a genius. did not even make it half way through the movie before having too stop watching due to way too much stupidityIf it wern't for Anne Hathaway (t.n.a.) and the Rock. Now I like goofy movies, but this went a little past that point. RENT FIRST before buying. who knows, maybe it will be better the second or third time I try watching this movie
0	Stupid: How this movie is getting such good ratings is beyond me.It just goes to show that people will like anything these days.People are such simpletons that I guess doesn't take much to amuse them.This movie is so stupid and no I am not comparing it to the tv show,I never even watched it.This movie was not funny nor did it have a good plot.Maybe I don't get Steve Carrel's humor,I don't know but I'm not gonna waste my time writing a long review for this horrid movie.I think they should stop making tv shows into movies.(Miami Vice,Land Of The Lost)It seems that it doesn't work.
0	Plain old Boring!: I remember GET SMART with fondness and loved watching it with my dad in the 60's-early 70's, so I guess I was expecting too much from this film and I actually left the theater about 40 mins. in. It just was not funny. It tried hard with the gadgets, and quips from the TV show, but for me it just didn't connect at all. I'm not being critical, just honest.
1	Delicious!!: I bought this Thai Green Curry paste to cook a Thai dish I'd seen made on of the cooking shows. It turned out PERFECT. I almost make that dish weekly now. Can't live without my Mae Ploy!
1	Spicey: This is real potent. It doesn't take a lot to make it firey. This tub should last a long time
0	A waste of talent: This movie has an all star cast but is so horrid. It is so funny to watch how horrible the movie is. Do not buy it, please save your money and buy shaft! This movie is so corny it is like you woke up in a comedy of Goodfellas.
1	WOwzeRs: I'm not usually a rock music person. I saw these guys on the shelf at a music store. so when i got home i downloaded one of the songs. I fell in love. I had to buy it. and so, of course, I did. The vocals on this album are amazing. His voice is so smooth! Well, you HAVE to buy this cd. I am telling you now, you wont be disappointed. My favorites are "Addicted" and "One Day", but i love them all too. So what are you waiting for!? click the BUY button, get ur credit card and.. and yah, from there do whatever u want..
0	Grow some balls, PLEASE!!!: This group is so WEAK I could puke! I am from the Montreal area like these guys, I am really truly embarassed by this band. Their material (I can't use words like art or songs because they don't apply) is so cookie cutter, radio pop, middle of the road friendly BS that I would not waste my time downloading it for free. message to the band: Grow up, I'm sure your all over 21... you have to admit it looks pretty stupid when a full grown adult sounds like an angry13 year old trying to impress a girl or piss off "mean old dad", but I guess good money can make anyone do anything eh guys?There is some really good music out there these days people, AIM HIGHER! avoid this sh*t and go find it.
0	"I think they lost their balls": This whiny pop punk ass bull sucks! If you listen to it, stick your extremeities into a blender. NOW.
0	Why are they compared to Good Charlotte?: They can't hold a candle to Good Charlotte. GC actually has some good guitar parts and SOLOS (yes you heard me). SP has none of that. They play slow power chords with sappy lyrics that are copied off of Blink and GC but are not sung with nearly as much emotion. At least Good Charlotte's lyrics are different, this bands lyrics aren't, its all boring love songs that we've heard a billion frickin times... I gave them 2 stars because I like a few songs but thats all. And you know what, all you people need to stop b****ing over whats "punk" and whats "poser". Good Charlotte have said themselves their not trying to be punk, so whats the use in arguing?
0	Punk? yeah right: Little preppy kids, this is NOT punk, this is pure pop with guitars. I can't stand this group, they sound like all the other pop bands out there like bad charlotte, sum 41, and blink182. There is no orginality here, all the songs sound the same. these guys are as punk as NSTYNC. If you want to listen to real punk rock get a Dead kennedys, rancid, bad religon or sex pistols cd!
1	Best CD Around: When I got this CD I don't know what I expected, but when I listened to it, I was like WOAH! THIS IS FABULOUS! I really reccommend it to EVERYONE! It has something for all. :P
1	Rick: I think all of the people who think Simple Plans album sucks can lick my balls because there is not one song that is not good on the Cd. I think simple plan did a great job making the album and everyone who thiks it sucks can lick my ballsack
0	THIS IS COOL: oh my god I love this band, they are so hot. I love they're punkish hairstyles and the way they dress. The music is awsome. IT's like the coolest cd I own besides Britney spears and good charlotte. The lyrics are like so deep, I almost cry. I'm a teenager too and I know how it feels when your parents yell at you and when you break up with your boyfriend and stuff.Damn my nail broke. Gotta go, American Idol is on. Simple Plan rocks!
0	STay away from all pop/punk at all costs!: Now i decided to review this rancid cd, i mean green day cd, o wait is it blink182? no wait its good charlotte o no its simple plan its all the same though,lol Punk= pop end of story its all the same you want to hear some meaningful music go pick up KoRn's self tituled debut and you can hear Jonathan davis (vocals for KoRn) crying in the background or go buy marilyn manson's antichrist superstar and go listen to the man that you fear now thats real and its not fake! Another person reviewing this garbage said the lyrics were sad?!?!? sad?!??! no pathetic heres pretty much what you get when you listen to this crap o no i wrecked my daddys car boo hoo o no god hates me he lieks to pick on me and i wish i was dead cause lifes to terrible thats bull*hit!!!! but its another band for the preppy popular kids. so sad it really is. It really is.
1	Yeah, yeah, yeah.....: Hey, moron.... it's "I'M SORRY, i can't be perfect" not "daddy, i can't be perfect".... Nothing else to say, just doing my part in trying to educate the losers of the world.
1	Simple Plan Rocks: If youre into bands like Good Charlotte, Green Day, or Blink182 then you should definitely get Simple Plan's album. Especialy if you like Blink and Good Charlotte, since some of those guys guest star in this album. Addicted,My Alien, and God Must Hate Me are just a few of the great songs on this album. If you love new punk music then you need to get this album.
0	Man, this actually sells?????: Now let me tell you right now that i DO like pop-punk(The starting line, Midtown, greenday, Fall out boy). But this is just garbage!!!What qualifies for music these days is just horrible. These guys have NO punk essense whatever. they are just pop. just cause you dye or spike your hair, wear a studden belt and skate shoes deos not make you a punk. these guys target demographic is11-13 year old girls who think thier life sux cuase a guy deosnt like them. They are just a boy band with guitars. This is as manufactured as mainstream pop garbage.
0	I wrote a poem on this band: Simple PlanYou say your punkThat is bull $h!tYou sang "I Don't Want To Think About You"Those Lyrics Connected To Me Cause That Is How I Feel About YouAll Who ANswer No To If This Review Is HelpfulCan Lick My....HandIf You Like ThemThen You Go To School Wearing Abercrombie and Spend Hundreds of Dollars Say Your Punk and The Only Ones That Agree With You Are Your Immature Poser FriendsSnoogans!Love,The JonesIf you agree your kick@$$!
0	REALLY BAD...: it's completelly embarassing the posture of the guys from simple plan....they must be 30 years old men, but sings naive lyrics with a complete lack of talent and the songs seems the same...TERRIBLE!!Almost everything on earth is better than this silly product.
1	Simple Plan Rocks: I was never into punk rock before I heard Simple Plan. Now I'm an all out punk rocker. Their album is incredible and basically tells the story of my life. I like it because I can relate to almost all of their songs and their sound is great. Not to mention their lead singer, Pierre, is so hot! I can't wait for them to come out with a new album. Everyone should own "No Pads, No Helmets... Just Balls"
0	badd: hprrible punk emo sellouts, try to sound like a band that deserves credit ANBERLIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0	THIS is What is Wrong with Music of Today: I don't have much to say but bands like this have no originality. I'm sick and tired of hearing pop punk emo whining bands that all copy off of each other doing the same old crap and making albums complaining about girls and whatever else. I'll admit, I haven't listened to this whole album, but just from the singles and clips I can tell exactly how this is. Come on people! Music is about new sounds and originality, these are the same chords and whiny lyrics we've all heard far too many times. Don't support this trash.
0	Well..: Well, I have listened to parts of this album, it's not very good. I just wanted to review because I wanted to be cool and bash a band like the "punk" fans on here. I want to fit in too :(
0	Sucks: See my review of their live cd.And god, go easy on the caps lock, you poser punk band loving psycho.
0	No balls... no helmets... just pads!: Maxi pads that is! I saw a poster of these posers, and they tried to rip off the Casualties. In this Casualties poster I have, the band is standing all pissed off in a junk yard, in the Simple Rip-Off, they stood tryin to look cool in an abandoned lot(i bet they had security to protect their rich boy asses!) I hate posers, and i am tired of rippin off the Casualties and other true punk bands.0 stars please!!!
0	*yawn*: It's obvious that Simple Plan is primarily aiming for the younger teens with this. At least I hope they are. The lead singer is not very good, and his voice may grate on your nerves. People bash Avril because they say she is a poser. Avril's never said she's putting out punk music. These guys believe they're punk....they aren't. Still, if you like sugar-coated, trl/radio friendly pop...with the tiniest breath of punk in it, then by all means, you can't go wrong here. If you want real punk rock, go with AFI. I would also like to urge you to check out KILL HANNAH, a little known band whose cd is coming out sometime next month.
0	Killing Rock and Roll: Many analogies fly, comparing Simple Plan to actual musicians. Bands like this, although obviously imitating better bands like Green Day, shouldn't be mentioned in the same sentence let alone "compared". Every time the music making department at Atlantic releases something like this, they may sell oodles of records, but they kill music a little more. I agree with that other guy. Go buy Nevermind. Music is an art, not a product. But that's just my opinion.
0	no pads, no helmets........just [bad]!: (i am actually14 yrs old)My friend has this cd, and I asked her if I could borrow it. Worst thing I ever did. The singer is really whiney. I could see why he was an unpopular person...
0	I HATE WANNABES!!!!!: i absulootly h@ wanabes they make me sick! ppl think their punk if they buy th@ sh*t from hottopic and listen to simple plan and other sh*t! it's the same evrywhere, they listen 2 avril lavigne and call themselvs sk8er bois, or they dress in black and call themselvs gothic! labels r 4 soup cans, and only some1 w/out a personality would just follow the crowd and buy whats popular! i also h8 whiners and preps, there r so many people whining about how terrible their life is and so on, we don't need to hear a grown man whining about their life, and pretending 2 b teenagers! hotopic just supports all those people buying th@ cheesy sh*t, so while im complaning about simple plan and all th@ sh*t might as well tell the world what i think about hotopic!!!
0	And this cd is the worst one ever: You know it's a sad day for punk rock when12 year old preppy girls flock to the NFG simple plan concerts. Why does punk rock suck so bad now? This cd is the epitomy of [bad] punk rock. If you want to listen to good punk/emo go buy Les Savy Fav ...
1	Another pop-punk band: Simple Plan is anothe pop-punk band. This CD is pretty kick ass. They've given the guys a hard time with the IMMATURE stuff but they're trying crits! I got the record as a present and I really liked it although I wasn't planning to buy it. The guys are growin up and I'm sure critics are gonna shut up on their next album.Simple Plan is simple...if your a teenager and y u?re trying to write up a song then you?d probably come up with something like one of SP?s songs. The bonus (Grow Up) and hidden (Christmas) tracks are really good and probably they?re the songs you could relate to the most.I would really reccommend this album to anyone who likes GC, NFG or something like that.
0	Ugggghhhhh...: The same rehashed Pop/Punk thats been used over and over again. Flavor of the week guaranteed. Let them have their moment in the sun. Let the little kiddies call themselves "punk". Let them have a taste of the rock star life style, but in a year they will be forgotten. This is what happened to Blink182, and Sum 41 was really big for a while, but they're losing it already. Now, it's New Found Glory(who are starting to lose it), Good Charlotte, and this unholy drivel known as Simple Plan. This pop/punk thing will be over... give it a year or two. THERE IS STILL HOPE FOR GOOD MUSIC!
1	Simple Plan Rules Canadian acts: I love Simple Plan adn i love this new album! all of the songs are really fun and easy to sing along with. It's constantly in my CD player and i take it with me every where. The boys are so talented at their insturments and I love Pierre's voice! This CD is definitly one to buy!
1	Sad lyrics with happy music... oddly nice.: Almost every single one of SP's songs are terribly depressing.It's obvious that lead singer Pierre has some issues with his family. The utterly depressing, tearjerking 'Perfect' is one of the saddest songs I've ever heard. But the rest of the CD blares out happy-go-lucky guitar riffs, juvenile lyrics, and just plain fun. I've had the pleasure of meeting these talented guys, and that is really what they're all about. This is a great easy listening CD - it may not be earth-shaking or momentous, but it is just good clean fun. Favorites include 'My Alien', which is just a funny song about a rather odd girlfriend, 'God Must Hate Me', which I'm sure is something we all can relate to (luckily He doesn't!), and 'I'd Do Anything'. Pierre's vocals go nicely with the whiney pop-punk music of Seb, David, Jeff, and Chuck. These guys are great - see them in concert, they're even better.
1	Such a GREAT CD!! I love it!: I really love this CD! It is more "poppish-punk" rather than true punk rock, but so good. The lyrics themselves are mostly about the pains of growing up and are sometimes on the down-side. However, musically this CD is so uplifting and is energy-packed. The songs are fun and the lyrics relatable for anyone who has ever been a teenager or 20-something, like me! They are a great band and the lead singer's voice is really unique. I love them because they are not only fun to listen to, but can actually sing. The best songs are toward the beginning of the CD, but really it's all good! For anyone who likes Good Charlotte, Avril, 3 Doors Down, Linkin Park, or Michelle Branch - or even if you don't; buy this CD.
0	Worst...band...ever: Every time I hear simple plan it makes me want to vomit. They have to be the worst band ever. Their songs are stupid and sound just like every other pop-punk band. Not original at all. Overall this album is a -100,000. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS GARBAGE!
0	Garbage at it's finest: This album is the prime example of what really bad pop is capable of. Now, I'm not bashing Simple Plan because it's Pop. There is some catchy pop that I don't mind. And I'm not gonna bash 'em for trying to be punk, though they are not, and if you think they are, you know NOTHING.Let's just focus on the music:Lyrics: Whiny, sappy12-year old stories of hating the world. Tried and done. Some bands do it. This band doesn't, and it sounds terrible.Singing: The lead singers voice is absolutely horrifying. It's unbelievable he's the lead singer.Guitars: Ok, they can play some basic rhythms. Yay. No creative parts whatsoever.Drums: The only aspect of the band I won't belittle or raise. But needless to say, nothing special.I won't even mention how awful their image is. I focused on the basics;Simple Plan Simple ... , God does hate them, and they are Kids, forever.Don't waste your time on this garbage.
1	love it accept for one thing: Great value for the price..... very comfortable and easy to use. The one thing I find which causes some discomfort is the foot cushioning mechanism. Being that you are actually hanging by your feet in full vertical, I feel the cushioning should have been designed in such a way in order to prevent any possibility of pain..... I do experience pain in the back of my ankles once hanging for over a minute, or after doing crunches. I'm 5'5" tall and weight112 lbs., so it is not due to excessive weight. Otherwise the product is a great deal.
1	ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh, finally!: When my table arrived, I couldn't wait for my husband to get home to assemble it. Turned out I didn't have to, it went together without a hitch. From the first use, I could feel a release of pressure in my spine that I hadn't felt in years. I took one star off since no matter how I adjust the height and foot rest, I still have to reach up and pull myself up (if I didn't slip this wouldn't happen). I wear boots so I slip less and can relax my feet, which also reduces the discomfort. I'm happy to deal with a little pressure on my feet in order to experience the euphoric release of pressure on my back, finally! It's amazing how your mood changes when the pain goes away...
0	inversion table: junk you get what you pay for. you better make sure someone is with you even if youve been on one before. im 5ft. 7 and i have to set it at over 6ft. to be able to get back up.that probably wouldnt be so bad but now you are not lined up with the back so its very uncomfortable. its a wonder they havnt been sued yet. also the ankle braces are cheesy and uncomfortable. im sorry i tried to go cheap. i was better off going to sports authority for 200. i got a reebock that i can return much more easily if i dont like it. im going to try and give no stars as its not worth1 star but i already put it in and i dont know if i can change it.
1	Worth every minute I spent on it: Get the facts straight from the source. The author is convinced that MS SQL is the best thing since sliced bread and that fact alone makes you want to keep reading. His positive and professional attitude puts the reader in the right mood to absorb and learn. He's not the "neutral observer" kind of author usually encountered (he's a member of the development team).Simply put, this book has the most actually useful, less known information about MS SQL I've ever seen (I've read more than 6 books on the subject). No "idiot-proof" hand holding, no useless screen shots. This book assumes you HAVE used a computer before and that you ARE a computer professional. Every suggestion given in the book is accompanied by the logic behind it as opposed to "change this setting to this value because I say so".Soukup is now on my list of "must-read" authors. Thanks Ron.
0	Works as a webcam but not as a digital camera: It's a cute little thing, but who wants to pay $25 for a cute little keychain bobble? Put in a AAA battery, start it up, take one photo, and the battery is dead. But it doesn't tell you the battery is dead, so you keep taking pictures, but they don't get saved. When you go to download the photos, you find you've only got the first one. At the cost of one AAA battery per photo, this has got to be one of the most expensive digital cameras on the market.Works ok as a webcam, but because its not really designed for that, you have to hold it in your hand to use it, so it's more or less useless for that application too.Save your money!
1	Love Chick Corea and Flora Purim Together: I used to listen to What Game Shall We Play Today back in1977. I never knew the name of the song or the amazing singer with the latin accent. After hearing the song in my head for over thirty years, I managed to locate it on Amazon a few weeks ago (wonderful benefits of modern technology). I love Flora Purim's voice, and the lyrics are beautiful. I am not a huge jazz fan, but I listen to this song over and over.
1	o.k. terrific: it's absolutely happening here. the gangmembers will probably be the evildoers' new police force
1	Amazing!: I too worked for Wolff New Media writing the NetBooks. Michael Wolff struck me as one of those fairly arrogant, not-much-time-for-the-little-guy entrepreneurs. I always assumed he was just like the many suits who were always coming through the office. It never crossed my mind that he was having his own private war with these guys, the investors or venture capitalists or whoever they were. His book is not only a total eye-opener but it's an amazing piece of writing. I read it one sitting. I can't believe that all this was going on around me and that I had no idea. I guess this book is like Barbarians at the Gate or Liar's Poker, but it's different too. It's real writing. It's great writing. You're in Wolff's head--a place I never imagined I'd be or want to be. But damn if it isn't one of the funniest places I've ever been.
0	Only read if want to read everything available on net biz: This is not a good book. If you want to read everything about net businesses, then go ahead, but I learned about as much on IPOs in the net world from a10-minute Business Week article on eloan, and most of the stuff about predicting where the net is going is his thinking from a few years ago and is outdated. The book jumped around a lot, and it is hard to stay interested.
1	~ The Best of the Star Trek movies~: The long awaited movie of the Star Trek crew did not disappoint. This is the best of the Star Trek movies in my opinion. Gene Roddenberry thought so too. Thrilling scenes of the Enterprise coming out of dry dock. This director's cut adds some superb effects that don't stray from the original film intent. The storyline is pure and in keeping with TOS (The Original Series) the humor is there but not campy and over the top like some of the following Star Trek movies. Highly recommend .
0	Must have for Trek colletors, otherwise...: Not much to be said about this film, use it for a sleep aid replacement. This or 2001:A Space Oddesy.The film is made longer, but not much so, (Even more BORING!)The Special Features are excellent, and much more exciting than the movie
0	Not a good start for the films: Someone, possibly the writer Harlan Ellison, possibly Steve my butcher, once called this The Motionless Picture. He was right. Terrible idea, terrible pacing, terrific special effects, and no fun watching Kirk and crew reunite. I can remember being about13 when this movie came out, actually dozing off in the movie theater. Stick with Star Trek 2, 4, 6 and 8. All the even ones.
1	Excellent...the VI Bible: I have used this book at my workplace for some time, and it is an excellent book. A must for any serious VI users. Now I am actually buying it so that I can quickly grab it for reference, instead of running down the hall to grab your friends copy.
1	Great non toxic product to reduce fly populations: Rescue FTA Fly Trap Attractant works great. Using new attractant in the reusable bottle is much more economical than the disposable traps. While there is a little odor close to the bottle, it can be used safely around pets where you wouldn't want to use poisonous sprays and powders. And it really works!
1	Arctic Dreams- a long read but worth it: Barry Lopez's Arctic Dreams may be a long read but it is worth it. Sometimes the language is a little over the top, and the authors personal ideas are interjected a little too much for my liking but the essence of the text and the beautiful scenes that are set up give a new perspective and really make the read worth it. This is a book I had a hard time putting down and picking it up again with ease, sometimes I would have to go back a few pages to remember what I read before so I could continue. This book really gave me new insight and a different way of thinking about the frozen tundra I really don't know a whole lot about, and made me appreciate its beauty in a new way and understand the importance of the landscape.
1	Great History Reading: I read this book for a college history course. It is a great book to read if you are interested in understanding the effects of world war Ii on different people. If you are not open to New ideas about history, then this isn't your book. If you are open to the fact that an epic event such as world war II can have a tremendous impact on people from all different aspects of the US, then this is your book. Thanks Studs.
1	Great book: I received this book as a gift, and subsequently purchased for a friend. The advice is practical, and the book isn't preachy. My15mo old routinely uses10 basic signs (milk, eat, pain, sleep, etc.), and I think our lives are much better for it. Instead of crying or shouting, she can ask for what she wants. I can't compare to other books, because I haven't read any, but sign language has been a very positive thing for our family, and we were successful using the advice in this book.
0	Poor Product: First time i used this mop, it left a lot of water on the floor and the mop head fell off. The instructions do not tell you how to get it back on. I expected more from a Mr. Clean product. Very disappointing. I have emailed Mr. Clean with zero reply's!
1	This Book is Truly An Eye Opener: I would recommend this book for All to read. It has truly changed my life for the better. I wanted to be closer to God and this book helped me connect with the higher power on a deeper level. This book has given me my faith back and has transformed my thinking and i am grateful that Dr. Stanley wrote this great book for those of us that are looking for answers to so many of life's questions. If you don't already have this book please get it. You will not be disappointed. I have a new way of looking at life and a new relationship with my creator.
1	A Fresh Look...: This book was wonderful. It gave new and practical insight into how we can truly hear from God. Stanley captures scriptural doctrine into every day practices that every Christian can and should implement.
0	Regretful: So I happen to love queer spec fic. I have a fondness for spooky movies that feature gay characters. But The Sacrifice is no Hellbent.The acting in this movie is atrocious. I never once believe that their was more than a passing attraction between the leads. Their interaction was so stilted and the kiss one of the most tepid I have suffered to watch.This is obviously an amateur production and it shows in the casting, the writing, and the scenery. The very ending was convenient and made little sense as the great powers the lead was supposed to possess never played a major role.I recommend avoiding this one. For a more sultry movie, try a DeCoteau - they may not be truly gay, but at least the quality is immensely better.
1	A Horror Treat for the Spooky season: A must see film for the Halloween season! Behind the autumn beauty of a small New England town lurks the decay and evil of a Satanic cult. Behind the lanky frame of a Gay Goth lies the power of a witch. Behind the mundane world of humdrum life there are ghosts, murders, and tales of illicit lust. In his first film, James Fessenden has woven classic chilling elements to create a terror tapestry of cold-hearted malice. Things are seldom what they seem, and there is no room for security in a world that only seems to be tranquil and quiet. As an independent film, it should be judged by its sinister spirit and not by the production values. This is a film that deserves to be watched on a cold autumn night when the wind rattles the house and creaking boards add to the atmosphere. See it with someone you want to freak out!
0	Disorganized, incomplete, and unfriendly: The book has lots of information but one has to go through lots to loops to get to where the information should be and then it may not be there.E.g., the index has no mention of the 'wm' command--one that I often encounter.E.g., another book implies that there is a canvas command 'delete all'. After I finally got to page 61, I found the 'delete' command but NOT any hint that one can use the 'all' command to delete all the objects on the canvas.Another example, even though the book purports to cover TK--the visual side of the language--I find just one chart, .Needless to say, there are very few examples.
1	TCL/TK in A Nutshell: "TCL/TK in A Nutshell" is an excellent reference book with comprehensive detail. It's not for novices, though. Newcomers to the language should be advised to start with something suited for dummies, and from there to search the Internet for specific explanations and examples.
1	everything went as expected: Product arrived on time and in perfect condition. I would recommend this supplier again. I will most likely order again.Thanks
1	Roses: I love romance novels that are clean, This was a very sweet book and fit into this category! After reading it I downloaded all the books by the author, Margaret Widdemer, free! I've not read any of the other ones yet.
1	Album Good For a Stupid Movie: I love this album. Don't scare me none is a good honest song. The movie is one of the worst I've ever seen. It's the reason JM hasn't done anything in the movies since.
0	Does not work buy something else: I purchased 3 traps and this was one of the three. Out of the three different traps this has caught one and I say one yellowjack in a week. The others have had to be emptied at least once...you do the math.
0	Does not work as effectivly as advertised: Our yard was infested with Yellow jackets. After installing 6 of these with the better separately sold attractant we watched yellow-jackets fly around these traps for days without having any more then 3 or 4 actually enter the trap. After the full 3 month term of the attractant we used the trap maybe captured 30 to 40 bees out of what we perceived as hundreds flying around.
0	Rescue My Wallet: Useless, a total waste of money. The wasps laughed at it. Did attract some flies however. So not totally useless.
1	The Gladiator: I first saw this movie when it came out fifteen or twenty years ago and got it on video. I have been trying to get it on DVD for years, but it is not available in Australia. Thanks to Amazon I can watch it again and again.
1	legends at work: listening to roy hargrove and karl denson play is as exciting as joe henderson/lee morgon or miles an trane. nuff said
0	anyone see what i did with this cd? caint find mine...: ...AND IM HAPPY ABOUT IT!i think i might cry if'n it shows up again. fareals.if albums where 3 dimensional this wouldn e'en make the c-side!i love me some roy, but bruh hurt me with this one.i forgive him tho, cause he done gave me much much pleasure up til now... ...um, hope that came out right.*pimp struts off stage/pounds chest with gorilla fist/machismo free flowing*m'out yall, peace!
0	Great movie; horrible DVD: The movie is great but if you're buying it to own a high-quality, pristine copy to watch over and over again, you'll be disappointed.The DVD image is covered with white specks, dust, and long hairs. They appear every second or two and are very noticeable even at full-speed. I would expect a VHS tape to have better image quality than this.In addition, I couldn't get the "special features" menu to work on two of my DVD players (although one of my friends has no problem). This continued even after I exchanged the disc for a new one.If you absolutely must own this movie on DVD, then you have no other choice. But for the others, I would warn that this disc does not nearly match the quality of the other 95% of...discs available.
1	Over120 Inspirational Recipes: Presented by a renowned Thai restaurateur, Thai In Minutes: Over120 Inspirational Recipes is a cookbook packed with swift and easy-to-prepare Thai dishes. Most have a total preparation and cooking time of about15 minutes or less. Notes on Thai culture round out the simple instructions, full-color photographs and explanations of traditional ingredients. A must have for connoisseurs of Thai food who are short on cooking time, Thai in Minutes includes such mouth-watering delicacies as Vegetable Wontons, Pork with Garlic and Peppercorns, Mango Sorbet and much more.
0	Quality of DVD stincks: I love the original series but feel cheeted. There were episodes that I remember that were not included. Mostly though the quality control in these DVD's is realy bad. My father owns a set, and he returned several sets before he got one that is mostly good. My set was good all the way through until the last disc. I have not returned it for fear that I'll get an even worse set.One of the things they did that I hate is they recorded on both sides of each disc, so if you get a bad one, a lot of episodes are potentially messed up.
1	where's Cy??: I wouldn't call this a complete set. Does anyone remember the episode where Starbuck and the cylon are stranded on a planet, and the cylon(Cy) gives his live for Starbuck? A wonderful episode, yet it seems to have vanished!!!
1	Im buying this set!!!!!: Battlestar Galactica is my favorite all time show!Frack!I know alot of people are saying bad things about Galactica.Its All talk and it sounds like some of ya are just jealous!Battlestar Galactica has everything! Awesome music its better than star wars!Great special effects the vipers are so cool!Beautiful cast{Sheba shes nice and pretty,Athena a goddes,Cassiopeia so lovely and with Starbucks sarcasim it goes good with Apollos calm and cool attitude.Boomer is cool too!My favorite episodes is Saga of a star world,war of the gods,the hand of god,the living legend,Baltars escape,the long patrol and murder on the rising star!See ya!
0	Terrible: Possibly one of the worst television shows ever created, this series totally destroys any quality its amazing premise had with horrible plotting and dialogue, and acting that was even worse. Rightfully cancelled mid-way into its second (even worse) season, "Galactica" somehow found its own little niche audience.Like any other series created by Glen Larson, it has a great premise, but can't get anything else right. The characters are poorly drawn, swaggering fools, and the Cylons are even worse. They're slow-moving, dullards of machines. It's a wonder even the foolish crew of the Galactica and its rag-tag fleet were able to defeat them so readily EVERY TIME they go into combat.Avoid this set, unless you're REALLY into watching bad TV and movies. This belongs on the same shelf with movies starring the likes of Steven Seagal and Freddie Prinze Jr.
0	Ohhh, Jilly, Jilly, Jilly: I await each Jilly Cooper book with great excitement. I love the pure escapism of her too good/too bad to be true characters. I love her witty turn of phrase. It takes a lot to get me to laugh out loud and she has accomplished it before. . .not this time however. I actually forgot, several times, I was reading this book--it was boring, the characters annoying and the premise unoriginal. I strongly recommend you not waste your time--go back and review Rupert/Billy the early days.
0	To be avoided: If you are a begginer looking for information on growing MJ or a more experienced grower requiring ideas then you will do very well to avoid this book. The material is poorly laid out, is often confusing as it is littered with spelling mistakes and seems to have been done in a slap dash manner [...] lots of ideas and details on hydroponic cultivation are very dated and would seem to date back to the late1970's.[...]
0	Disappointed: I bought this set to have some extra sockets around the house. I was hopeful this would be a great product, but unfortunately, it's not. The whole set isn't very good in quality and I figure they would probably break if you used them very heavily. I just threw the set in the garage in case every other socket I have disappears, I at least have this set as a backup.
0	TERRIBLE!: Well our friends in CHINA have turned out another CHEAP CHEAP product! Sockets fall off the ratchet and extension with the slighest movement. Socket walls are so thin I am sure they would split with the lighest load! Bought this to carry around in the trunk of my car...I should have known better! Avoid this one! Amazon refunded my money right away and did not want the set returned.
0	DISAPPOINTING: Looked good out of the box. However, upon first use, the yellow handled driver broke. The plastic handle cracked while trying to loosen a nut. Then, the1/4 inch adapter broke while using the ratchet inside the13mm socket.Not a durable set of hardware to say the least.
0	You get what you pay for: For the money, this is not a bad deal. Yet I found it to be of inferior quality. The ratchet looks like die cast metal even though it is "triple chrome plated." It is rough around the edges and is not like an evenly polished higher quality tool set you see at other stores. The driver handle is cheap plastic that reminds me of a similar one I had that split and broke from the shaft. For a flea market type set that does the job, I guess this is what you would be looking for.
0	worth it for the price: the ratchet is too weak. not even able take off one nut before it broke. need to shop for another one now.
0	Cheapest build quality I have ever seen in my life: I know this is only10 bucks and I was certainly expecting cheap and cheerful. But this beats all standards of a poorly made product. The blow molded case is a disaster - nothing fits in its place. The ratchet is the cheapest I have ever seen and the sockets themselves are very poorly finished. Comes with duplicate sockets - one each for quarter inch and 3/8 inch I believe. A simple 3/8 to1/4 adapter would have sufficed, but that's an entirely separate design issue. I would never buy this again, even for the low price.
0	For display only: I decided to buy this because I needed to do an oil change on my car. After two minutes of using it the wrench it got stuck and never worked again. You can actually tell it is bad quality just by turning it by hand. I wouldn't recommend this item to anyone (not even for a small job). The item is on its way back for a full refund thanks to Amazon great customer service. Lesson learned, whether you use them a lot or not, these tools need to be of good quality so spend the extra couple of dollars and save yourself the hassle.
1	Doesn't make you an expert, but more than enough to pass.: I only gave this book 4 stars because of the numerous typos. Bottom line is, it's an easy read--a much easier read than the Sybex book or the Cisco Press. If your goal is to pass the BSCN, and if you want a book that's straight forward, with the authors not trying to impress you with unnecessary technical mumbo jumbo, then this is your book. With this book, and the study questions from cheet-sheets.com, you're sure to pass. I passed with an 816 only reading this book once, reading two chapters a week. Just remember, you only need 690 to pass. Good luck.
0	Quick Shot?: Thomas M. Thomas and his co-authors did a very poor job this time. When I studied for the BCMSN exam, I was glad to have a copy of the McGraw-Hill book, but this one seems to be nothing but a quick shot, published before the others do. Very rarely, I read a book containing such a huge amount of errors. Fortunately, many of them are such obvious that you have to notice them at once; and not all of them can be presumed to be errata (or at least, they shouldn't be). For example, a multicast address of 2214.0.0.10 (!) was stated, and you will be presented a chaotic mixing of hyphenated and non-hyphenated commands which you will surely be asked to keep apart in the exam.Some chapters as those covering (I'd better say: not covering) EIGRP or BGP are much too short because many topics - as route maps - are almost completely omitted. After all, I would recommend to read the Ciscopress book instead to be sure you get all the information needed.
1	One of my favorite CDs: This CD is full of bouncy, upbeat dance music that is fun to listen to. The accordion playing is wonderful.
1	Dora's reviews: My husband and I watch this movie a lot. It is funny. I had never heard of this movie but I am glad I purchased it. I recommend it to anyone.
0	Disappointed child and mama!: My 20-month old son loves Road Construction Ahead and many other videos that focus on earth-moving equipment and "machines", as he calls them. We purchased this video hoping to add a little variety to his collection but have been disappointed with it. For a young child, perhaps under 3, this video has far too much dialogue, not enough action, and loads of ridiculously unfunny jokes and slap-stick humor that little kids just don't get. My son likes looking at the video box but doesn't enjoy the video at all. Try Road Construction Ahead instead.
1	Remarkable memoir, remarkable woman: Ayako Ishigaki's wonderful fictionalized memoir is revealing for it's sometimes subtle, sometimes angry, and sometimes tender treatment of the both the culture she was born into and the culture she experienced in the U.S. It's also a remarkable historical document that presents views of Japanese women that may startle the reader. The writing is fluid and engaging. You can read it easily in a day or two.
0	NOT the BEST from the BEST: The waffle maker and sandwich maker USED TO work great. (I never had the opportunity to use the pizzelle part.) Everyone in the family, including the kids, hated the BAM! written all over their food but the food came out great. It worked fine for three or four months but then the non-stick coating started to bubble and peel off. And it is supposed to be high-end ALL-CLAD? It ended up being returned with no questions asked...makes me wonder how many others were returned. Hmmm...
0	This has got to be the worst batman movie ever.: Batman Returns is just plain sick at times. The Penguin, who used to be almost loveable in the original comics, is a homicidal nutball in the movie. The catwoman (who is in herself at times very disturbing.) is blond (she is supposed to be raven haired) and more of a pain to watch then anything else. The only redeeming value is the occational funny line from Penguin.
0	.: Tim Burton's worst movie, hands down. It's visually interesting, but that's about all. Batman himself seems like a secondary character in this sequel, and unfortunately I couldn't get into Danny Devito very much. He plays the role well, I suppose, but the story is awfully flimsy and there just isn't much to latch onto here. I will say that Michelle Pfiefer ... oh my ... I had a crush on her for months after seeing this for the first time. And it isn't just the skin-tight leather outfit (although it sure helped.) My. But in any case, watching her was the only redeemable distraction I could find in this disappointingly poor movie.
1	Batman: Returns, Awesome but dosent match "Batman":1992 saw the release of the much anticipating "Batman: Returns" and it really is a mixed feeling movie. Its enjoyable but in the way it dosent match its predessor "Batman" it is very cool how it is all dark and got a creepy vibe and its storyline is OK but it just dosent really meet perfection. Penguin is absolutely disgusting and i really hate him and Catwoman is cool but in other words they are cool villians. Same "SPECIAL" featues as #1. This film is good and I reccomend you to see it but if u have to choose1 out of the 2 "Batman" is the way to go.
1	"Gentlemen, start your screaming!": Danny DeVito makes an execellent Penguine. And Catwoman teams up with the Penguine. Batman (Keaton) fights the two villains and defeats one of them. However, it isn't clear if Catwoman got away or not. One of the better Batman movies.
1	The best Batman!: If you haven't seen it, you must. Michelle Pfiffer is the best catwoman...Halle Berry can't hold a candle to her awesomeness. Micheal Keaton is a great Batman. Definite must see!
0	It;s too Dark: I don't what I disliked about this movie the most. The fact that Gothom City looks like a war zone, or the fact that the story's focus is not on Batman again (even though the movie is called Batman) or that the Penquin is the most repulsive one ever created for film. The first movie had Jack Nicolson in it, this one has nothing.
0	Eeeyew!: This movie is disgusting. None of the characters are the least bit interesting and it seems the sole purpose of Danny Devito's Penguin is to be gross. At least the original Batman movie had some wit and decent music. Don't waste your time with this worthless use of videotape.
1	The best BATMAN ever!!!!!: Tim Burton's direction shines in this picture. It's perfect. "Batman Returns" is dark and mysterious the way it should be. The series needs to return to these dark roots again; take the neon off the batmobile, take the nipples off the batsuit, and please get rid of Alicia Silverstone!!!! (And bring Catwoman back.)
1	Great book: This is a great book, honestly I have using a lot of its know-how on my job.My advise is that all reader should know the decorator pattern to understand better the class structure, and I hope in the next version add some information about it.
0	One man's biography: I didn't know this was going to be a one man biography....had expected more detail of Mississippi and the south over this period of time.
0	Not enjoyable: The reviews here reveal that some people found pleasure in this film. Unfortunately, I do not find myself among them. I could not wait for it to end. I watched the whole thing only because I had paid to rent it, but it was mostly a painful experience.No one is really connected to anyone in this film. Almost all the characters seem narcissistic and flippant. There are so many characters introduced who are carrying zany, personal issues, and we are supposed to care about these. But the reader has no motivation to care, due to the disorganized storyline.The attempt to create a warm reunion of people who care about each other falls short. None of the characters have much heart, and there are even several face-slapping scenes! The only appealing character was the young nerdy woman, who appears briefly. Please, let us have more well-written films with appealing characters.
0	April's Shower: It was okay. The acting wasn't all that great and neither was the story line. I did like how April's mother came around so fast and was more concerned about her daughter being happy rather than who she was with.
1	depends: This is a good book if you just want to read about what grace Slick did outside of Airplane and why she decided to do it. It isnt one of those books which documents every single date of release of album and what happened within the record company and how it was marketed in the nation etc.... Those books are good but to me this is a nice change to very complicated books, and although she does write the book in an informal manner, it makes it better as it sort of seems right to talk about stuff away from the band in the tone she uses. this book is mainly sex, drugs, and a bit of rock and roll. Still very funny and good sense of humour though. Just depends what style of book you are after.
0	A horribly written and edited book about the queen of rock.: Where did Grace find this "writer" to co-author her biography? What could have been a terrific and insightful look at one of rock and roll's greatest and most rebellious icons instead reads like entries from a diary. Poorly sequenced and unimagitively written, this book suffers from an obviously inexperienced co-author who has a pre-occupation with Slick's sexual trysts and demonstrates little interest in nor knowledge of her music-making. She should stick to writing romance novels. I'll remember Grace Slick for her electrifying performances and wonderful music, but never this book. Get it from the library and save your money.
0	Disappointing: Considering the life she's led I would have expected more from Slick's autobiography. A big yawn--I skimmed through the last 200 pages.
1	This book had a lovely romantic twist to it!:): I am not a great fan of Mrs. Alcott, but when I began reading this book, I was immeditaly hooked. The plot was so interesting and something happened in each chapter--and whatever happened always had to do with Edith--wheather it was Lady Ida cursing her or Lord Percy admiring her--it always had to do with her. This book had a romantic feel to it, and it wasn't how I would have expected it to be. The romantic part was kept hush-hush amongst the charecters--but the irony of it was everyone knew about it. I really enjoyed this book and I recommend it to anyone who is looking for a new summer book. It's great!
1	Astral Projection at their finest: Astral Projection has been making the greatest trance for years and years. And its great to see that after more than 5 years, they are as good as ever! Although I dont think any track on Another World matched the power of their early classic "Powergen", every single song off this album is amazing. Astral Projection have changed their sound a little bit from their prior "Dancing Galaxy" album, adding some new progressive-sounding synths to their arsenal. Still they keep their own original flavor. This is my favorite album of 99 so far and if you knew anything about true trance music, you would agree!
0	Back Care Yoga A Waste of Money: I was really disappointed by this DVD. My acupuncturist had recommended that I try a Rodney Yee video, but I don't think he knows that this is mostly fluff--there's lots of advertising and talking, but only 20 minutes of actual yoga. So as a yoga session, it's just too short to be of much use except for absolute beginners--but it's clearly not aimed at them, as Rodney uses poses that true beginners would not already know, and does not instruct in how to do them.More important, the yoga exercises are too short. The program is 90% stretching, but the stretches are not held long enough to be effective. The poses are also too brief. And there are not enough of them--real back work involves strengthening back and abdominal core, but there are only a few poses in this program that do that.Based on this DVD, I will not buy anything from this source: it feels like a moneymaker scam to me.
0	Backcare Yoga for Beginners: This product is garbage and Amazon should be ashamed of themselves even allowing it to be sold on line to unsuspecting customers.
1	Terrific purchase: Beautiful Sateen sheet set. Price was great and quality is above average. Will definitely purchase from this merchant for all my bedding needs. Great seller!!!
0	Not much here: I was dissapointed in this little book. It looks like the book was rushed out to capitalize on the war and Rumsfeld media attention. Not much here in terms of learning - Rumsfeld is pretty command and control.
1	Krames Provides a Quality Read on Rumsfeld: I liked the way the book was organized. It distills Rumsfeld into an understandable person with recognizable leadership principles and skills. You can see why he has been successful and even appreciate his no-nonsense approach. A good quick read on a unique individual.
0	Pointless: What a waste of money! She loves the life she didn't expect? Page after pages sounds more like she's praying for a man to come along and save her. Let's all just bide our time until a man comes along. I don't fault her for wanted to get married, but the last thing I wanted to read this weekend were a bunch of short stories about how all her friends are getting married and she isn't. The reality is if she really loved the life she didn't expect she would talk about all the things she has done because she is single. If I had gotten married, I never would know the joy of living on my own, come vacation time I always get to pick where I go next and I love my career. Believe me, there is something to be said for doing what you want, when you want without input from someone else. Sure someday I may get married, but he would have to be a heck of a guy for me to give what I've got. So bottom line, live your life for you, not for someone who may or may not come into your life.
0	disappointing: I was expecting so much more after _Dawn and this book wasa disappointment. I know many people who never bothered toread the last book in the series because this one lefta bad taste in their mouths.The characters just didn't connect, no empathy with them.
1	Love it! Love It! Love It!: Love it! Love It! Love It! "The Pre-Foreclosure Property Investor's Kit" by Thomas Lucier is very informative and a must read for anyone interested in this type of real estate investing. Mr. Lucier tells in detail how to negotiate with homeowners in trouble, how to be the solution to their problem, and how NOT to have the door slammed in your face. He also demystifies the process of dealing with the homeowner's lender by explaining in detail each step in the process of taking the property off their hands. This book, along with Dean Graziosi's [[ ASIN:1593154461 Be A Real Estate Millionaire: Secret Strategies for Lifetime Wealth Today]] have helped me so much in understanding how to be successful with foreclosures.

1	information was easily applied,: This book, was very well organized. easy to understand and apply, I ordered three books and this was the best of all three.
0	Don't waste your money....: Different paperweight, same seller: I ordered 3 of these from this seller. They came defective. Each of the dahlia pictures had flaws/defective markings. It looked like a crease in the picture or a depression made from to much pressure. The quality just wasn't there & I just couldn't give them as gifts as planned. I contacted the seller & shared this with them. They would not provide me with a postage paid return label to send them back & really didn't seem to care that they sent me defective items. There just wasn't customer service offered. I bought it, they have their money & whatever, not their problem. I began researching their reviews & found this was normal for them. I wish I had never made this purchase. I am out even more by having to pay for my own return shipping on these defective paperweights to get a refund & this is money I really don't have to spend. I would never purchase from them again & I hope you don't have the same experience I have had.
1	Just great!: I heard Van Hunt on NPR and immediately ordered the CD. In his interview with Travis Smiley, he mentions that one of his favorite artist is Prince. Mine too!As other reviewers have mention,this is no ordinary artist and an extraordinary CD. Van Hunt is amazingly talent. I can't say what I like more the voice, music or lyrics. It's very hard to categorize his style. The best way to know is to listen to the sample clips.I've played the CD as background music when entertaining guests and have received great reviews. You won't be disappointed.
1	Good book to understand USA for an european: After my own travel through USA I red Steinbekc's book. It has given me the oportunity to understand a lot of your spirit. His openminded vision is one I have not seen so often over your interesting nation
1	One of the Best Travel Books Ever Written: I just finished the book and it was a fantastic read. It was a fairly "light" book, considering the author; it was genuinely hilarious at times, and, as always, Steinbeck created an incredibly vivid, personal, and accurate portrait of the relationships between nature and society. Shades of his earlier can be seen in the prose style, and his unconditional devotion to the creation and development of images and characters can't be matched by anyone from any time.As far as a "Travel-style" novel is concerned, I think I liked this one more than Kerouac's On the Road...but, then again, Steinbeck was far more talented than any of the Beats -except Ginsberg (who might've been in his league, but in a junior-varsity-type capacity) and maybe Neal Cassidy.If you like Steinbeck, you will really enjoy reading this book.
1	Traveling: I liked some of his other works better, but this one is OK. The concept is good but now it is somewhat dated as his trip was in the '60s.
0	This book deserves less than one star: This is the most boring book I have ever read in my entire life, and I have read quite a few books. How Steinbeck could say soooooooo much about soooooooo little makes my head hurt. It is very good if you are an insomniac, though.
0	torture!!: This book is painful to read because you are hosted by a crotchety old man who is annoyed by life and loves no one except his dog. He meets people who he finds boring and visits places that insult him and tells you about all of the lousy things that happen to him and then reminds you of all of the good things that have disappeared about America. If you love Steinbeck don't read this book because perhaps you are meeting the real man and you will feel different about his other beautiful books. If you don't know Steinbeck and want to, try Pastures of Heaven or Cannery Row. Those books are how you want to remember him by, and not by this last, wheezing gasp.
1	As timely now as when released...: This film is a must-see for those who have power over war and peace. Think about it - the peace treaty is about to be torpedoed by high ranking officers of both the Klingon Empire and the Federation, who stand to lose big time if peace ever breaks out.Is there any similarity to the present Israeli-Palestinian conflict? Looks like it... Especially since, every single time there is a chance for peace, some new attack on the part of anyone over there derails whatever progress is made. Almost seems like the rogue Federation and Klingon officers of this film. But I digress...This picture is a huge credit to the filmakers of the Star Trek saga, just when it was most needed (after the disaster that was Star Trek V). If you are interested in serious science fiction, toelrance between cultures or are in the mood for a good thriller, watch this one. If you live in the Middle East, by all means watch this one!
0	Booklet NOT included!!!!!!! Paramount execs are tightwads.: Just when you thought Paramount was coming around and being nice...they find a way to stick it to the ever faithful Star Trek fans who support the franchise and the undeserving pocketbooks of the Paramount executives.After "re"-releasing all 5 movies in its "special edition" format after making the public buy all the movies in its regular "no extras" format, the executives in an effort to "save costs" decide to skimp out on the booklet. Booklets which which accompanied the previous five special edition releases!So after all that the executives manages to screw the loyal fans once again -- enough to make one FUME with rage.That's not to down grade the movie -- which is exceptional due to Nick Meyer's direction. Mr. Meyer, if you read this I hope you give the TIGHTWAD Paramount execs a piece of your mind on our behalf.
1	Fine Trek: Star Trek VI abandons the cutesy humor of the previous two films, wisely returning the series to its serious roots. Kirk and crew are swept into a Cold War game of cat-and-mouse when the Klingon emissary they're assigned to protect is assassinated. Along the way, Kirk must confront his anti-Klingon racism, while Spock faces personal challenges of his own. Darker in tone (revealed particularly well through Cliff Eidelman's effective Batman-like score) and genuinely suspenseful, the film suffers only from a sense of failed grandeur--we keep expecting to see great battlefleets that never materialize. Director Meyer's characteristic anachronisms abound--the crew sleeping in WWII-style bunkbeds; an actual galley aboard ship--but he keeps the pace right, and sexy Cattrall and Iman are welcome additions. This is the last Trek featuring all of the original crew, delivered on a DVD that looks and sounds good.
1	The Final Journey: Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country is probably the most entertaining film of the Star Trek franchise. Released in1991, 2 years after that stinker Star Trek V: The Final Frontier (It had it's brief moments, though) Kirk and crew make their final journey after 25 years of thrilling us with their adventures. Awesome special-effects, excellent acting all around, an incredibly good villian (Chang) played well by Christopher Plummer and a perfect ending, passing on the torch to the crew of Star Trek: The Next Generation. An absolutely thrilling Star Trek film to watch again and again. Kirk returned in Star Trek: Generations meeting a tragic fate at the end. If you haven't yet, add this great Star Trek film to your collection.
1	Not the best Star Trek ever but Great Price: Not the best of the Star Trek movies but none the less a must to complete the set.I paid less than $8 and got it within days, very well packaged. Great Buy!
1	The voyage home is the best: I liked all three movies but it wasn't until they got to "The search for Spock" that they got the editing right on the Star Trek movies. Very intertaining though.
1	Wierd but interesting: Attila was an interesting yet strange book. The character goes through a mixture of complex reality mixed with hallucinations. I specially enjoyed Chapter 5.
1	Used Boat Notebook: From the Pages of Sailing Magazine, Reviews of 40 Used Boats Plus a Detailed Look at Ten Great Used Boats: As expected from Sailing Magazine, a well written and comprehensive guide in the selection of great used sailboats. Covers all of the pluses and the minuses of 40 'classic plastic' sailboats from small to large. Of particular interest is the review of things to look for and problems that exist as well as performance and accomidations.
0	Not worth reading!: Still trying to validate the paper it's printed on. The only thing I liked about the book was the design of the pages. Found the essays not especially well written and am looking forward to discussing it with our book review group to see if they can actually shed some light on the issues. Guess I wasn't lonely enough to want to crawl up with this book....it made me fall asleep.
0	Author in Jail for Criminal Tax Evasion: Larken Rose has been sentenced to15 months in jail for failure to file. If you follow his advice and the IRS prosecutes, you will lose. The information in this video is100% false by the rulings of the IRS and dozens of courts in the prosecution of those who took Rose's advice. This IRS is aware of people using the fraudulent information in this video and screens returns for people making frivolous arguments such as this.The IRS has a publication entitled: "The Truth About Frivolous Arguments" - Larken Rose's arguments are among those in this publication.
1	Redemption for Eddie Murphy: Finally, a funny Eddie Murphy movie that my children can watch. Not the usual garbage mouth from Murphy.
1	Because Of The Songs & The Year:1945 was a very significant year in the history of the world, but certainly not for this movie. I was10 years old & though my parents did not go to see this movie, the song, "Don't Fence Me In" was very popular & became engraved in my heart along with "Tumbling Tumbleweeds."Since I grew up in southern CA, I saw many tumbling tumbleweeds & I am happy now to have finally seen the movie - even though it is not a particularely good movie I am giving it 4 stars just for sentimental reasons.
1	Excellent resource for busy educators: Having purchased many types of teaching resources over the last few years, I have finally found one more helpful than all the others combined. Evertson not only outlines the procedures in an easy to read manner, but she also gives excellent examples of her theories in practice. I was expecting a book that strictly dealt with keeping order in the classroom, but what I received was so much more. This book describes ways to teach that will ensure that classrooms run smoothly and more importantly the students learn. I only hope that other new teachers find this text at the beginning of their careers as the advice contained is invaluable. If your budget or time schedule only allows for one book, definitely buy this one!
0	the movie with kristi swanson was better.: i think that the show is dumb and that buffy in the movie is a senior! in the show, she's a junior. what's the deal? and i think that kristi is a much better buffy.
1	Hot Buffy Tapes a Must!: I am a die-hard Buffy fan and I was thrilled to find out that I could get the episdoes on tape. The tapes include:Welcome to the Hellmouth/ The Harvest, Witch, Never Kill a Boy on the First Date, Angel, The Puppet ShowAll of the shows are wonderful and I highly recommed that you buy them!!!!
0	Poor Product: Don't waste your money on this one. It didn't work for me right out of the package. I didn't bother to replace the batteries since the device is obviously made cheaply.
0	Touchpad mouse: I have had to use the touchpad type mouse for years due to a pinched nerve, causing my hand to go numb.The old one, from years ago was far, far better than this one! I guess they were bought out and the qualityis not so great. I cannot make the software work with Vista. They made a simple thing more compliacted.I wish that my old one had not worn out and it would work with Vista. Please, someone come up with a REALLYgood touchpad mouse for a P.C.
1	Me too...: A friend of mine turned me onto these, in one word... great! However, for my first major day of usage at a local outdoor concert, a young kid whom was looking the other way, stumbled over my footrest and broke it. Being that the footrest is really the best part of the chair, I was extremely disappointed. Unfortunately, no apology was offered. I will attempt a fix on my own, otherwise try to return or buy a new one.
0	A beach disaster: We received two chairs...the arm on the first one broke when the first person sat in it. A160 pound man, not a giant person. The second one won't fold up. So they are useless.
1	Folding Chair Reviewed: These chairs are so comfortable that we move them from the deck to the inside of the house to watch T.V.......and so easily moved that they go back out again in the morning!
1	Uniquely Superb: The Cyclical Serpent provides and excellent review of the wisdom of the ages and how they are relevant and to, and supported by, the latest astronomical observations and brilliant theories of physics that are so clearly explained by Dr. Halpern. This book makes the wonders of the universe understandable and their correlations to our every day lives observable. I highly recommend this read!
1	Great binoculars, great price: I was looking for inexpensive, but functional, binoculars to use with school groups in outdoor settings. These binoculars are WAY better than I expected for the price. The optics are crisp and the binoculars are easy to focus with the rocker-type focus (easier for kids than a dial that has to be turned). They are relatively small and lightweight (given the power). To be nit-picky, the only minor disadvantage is that they have lens caps that do not have straps to hold them to the binoculars, but that's the case with most of the binoculars that I have already. So...I'll set aside the caps and not worry about taking them into the field. The neck strap is a basic, narrow webbed strap, although the strap on the case is wider and potentially more comfortable for extended carrying.
1	Good Packaging: Good packaging, awesome for sightseeing. Has a case and covers, which adds to the protection and care of these binoculars.
1	this is a quality product, totally worth the price: I bought this for binocular for those occassional trips to the national parks. I did not want something too expensive, (as it would be for occasional trips) or too cheap (wanted something with a decent magnification for widlife watching). This is a decent size binocular. Easy to focus, thanks to the instafocus. It produces very bright and clear images, and the 7X zoom also works well for bird watching etc. Tried looking at some birds on trees in the neighbourhood. It comes with a pouch, 4 lens caps, a soft cloth for cleaning the lens and 2 shoulder straps, one for the binocular and the other for the pouch. It has a very solid, well made feel and the entire outer body is covered in rubber for better grip and protection. Overall, a very good product well worth the price.
1	Big Bang for the Buck: I bought these to carry with us in our travel trailer because they were inexpensive and from a manufacturer with a name I knew. My wife and I love them! They were easy to set up and the instructions clearly tell how to use the diopter to get perfect vision, even though I wear prescription glasses and one eye is slightly weaker than the other. We especially like the quick focus feature where you use a simple toggle lever adjustment in lieue of a dial in the center or the binoculars to focus the scene. They have a nice carrying case to protect them from scratches too.I would definitely recommend them to a friend and we might even get a second pair for the travel trailer.
0	Plain stupid: This book is stupid... the romance... the vampires... everything and why did she use that poem? Amelia never actually stated if these vampires are demon or not. They hold emotions of love and that doesn't make 'em demon...
1	I couldn't put it down: The minute I got this book I started it. From that time on, I never put it down... I loved it. I'm not a big reader, but I was so into this book, I think it is an awsome book, along with the one before it, In the Forests Of the Night. I now own them both, and plan on getting the next one soon.
0	Ugh.: I picked up this book looking for something interesting to read.And I must say I was a bit jealous to find that this author is a year younger than I am and has an array of books published.But you know what? I'm no longer jealous. Because a retarded monkey could come up with better character developments and plots than Ms. Atwater-Rhodes has put in this novel.I barely got halfway through this book when I threw it across the room, finished with the drivel that she called a story. It immediately earned a place next to Foxfire and To Ride a Silver Broomstick in my collection of "Books I would never sell to anyone for I would not want them to suffer by reading this crap."Save yourself some time and buy anything by LJ Smith, Kelley Armstrong, or (dare I say it) Anne Rice. Even Ms. Rice is better than this girl, and I hate that woman.
0	Over Hyped: This book is many times more shallow then I would have expected from such a praised writer. For all the magazines (Teen, Y.M etc...) I expected to read a story with some depth.Not one with simple, personalitiless characters that easily fall into cliches. But this is not the only problem the entire concept is done in an amaturish manner.It's obvious within minutes of starting the story it was written by someone without any real-world-experience.The only thing that this book accomplished was to prove that Hype can't make a story.
0	Horrible teenybopper fluff: "Demon In My View" (the title is lifted from Poe's poem "Alone")contains nothing of redeeming value, or any serious literary merit. I think any 6-yr old could produce better art while half-asleep. The story is trite, confused, slow, and stereotypical. The editor should be immediately fired for letting this into the market. The annoying social consciousness, laughable teenage "angst," and downright idiocy will appeal to the "Dawsons Creek" crowd I am sure, but this is not for me, or any other discerning and intelligent reader.
1	And I don't have short arms.........: I had shoulder surgery and had to buy a recliner to sleep in as I healed. I am 5'8" and don't have stubby arms but I could not reach the handle to put the legs down on the recliner. I saw this and purchased it. My whole family is glad, since even my 6'2" husband and father had trouble reaching it to.
0	Big Need for this Solution, Poor Design in the Execution: I am an Ergonomics Consultant with VERY short arms. This product looked like just what I needed to be able to reach the handle on my recliner without over-extending my right shoulded. I injured it about a year ago, and it has been difficult for me to reach the handle more than ever.Unfortunately the design of the product made it only slightly easier for me to reach the handle and the hard metal handle stuck out into the walk way and I must have hit my leg on it 5 times before I decided to return it. I applaud Standers for their attempt at addressing this issue, but they missed the mark in my opinion when it came to design.
0	Left hangng: Troll Quest is a well written book until you get to the last chapter where the author appears to have just gotten tired of writing. The book builds slowly, a well written storyline headed for a climactic finale and then the reader is left hanging with no conculsions and no sequel. Very frustrating and disappointing.
1	Now this is fun....: Besides thrills,laughter,easy readings,great conversations and a bit of mystery and a lot of suspense,you will get a fine dose of humour.McBain at his funny best.
0	Do not buy this book: This book has so many mistakes it should be used as a door stop or fuel for the fireplace. I ended up referring back to inside VC++ 5.0 and looking at the COM section in that book. If you need to learn about com see gopalan sureshes web site. He give practical information on COM and CORBA.
0	what a piece of waste!: this book goes on and on and on about the same thing. the author must love to hear him self rambling in a empty space. there is no useful information in this book. if you want to learn COM and DCOM, buy microsoft press's books.
0	I wouldn't take this book from a friend for free.: Here's a little blurb from the "Why is COM Needed" section:"... Each compiler produces a set of machine language instructions (binary numbers) that are designed to be fed by the operating system into the CPU of the computer in structured ways to produce program behavior....".With gems like that early in the book, how could I take the rest of the book seriously as a technical work? I pressed on, but basically the rest of the book seemed disorganized and filled more with studying example output from "wizards" and such.Maybe if you're looking to study micros~1 Visual Studio "wizard" output, then this book is for you. If you're looking for a solid understanding of the basics, stay away.BTW, ALL authors should lay off the lame attempts at humor. Readnig bad attempts at humor are much worse than reading a technical book that is dry.
1	Great Stuff: The reviewer was quite rough. Not every song on this CD is great, but it has some of the most rockinest music I have ever heard for the most part, especially the first two tracks.
1	great album: I luckily found this cd at a used bookstore. It was a great find, since it is hard to get now a days. I had first heard it when I was in college. It is one of those albums that sticks with you years later. It is a great driving cd. The songs are upbeat and groovy that make you happy.
1	Bunuel at his best: This was the first Bunuel movie I saw and it stays my favorite. I saw it in the movie theater and by the end 70% of spectators had left. The reason was that they were not prepared for Bunuel (It was in Gorki, Soviet Union,1986 or 87). I wasn't either but I fell in love with the movie from the very begining. It stupid to try to reveal the plot, because there's none. If you ask me, the plot of this movie is the same as in That Obscure Object of Desire (my second best Bunuel): You can't get what you crave for. For it's not the plot that matters, it's the mood, l'ambiance. And those little things like the story about Brigadier. If you have never seen a Bunuel film, start with this one!
1	Short, but pretty good.: In UC0079 Zeon learns of a new type of Gundam being built on the colony of Libot. They send a spec ops team to investigate. Bernie's Cyclops is shot down on the mission and he meets a boy named Al. Al is infatuated with mobile suits and follows Bernie around on his mission. Al's neighbor is actually the test pilot of the new machine. As this story unfolds their lives will be changed forever.This Gundam series is only 6 episodes. It's is a bit older so the animation is very dated, but the story is pretty good. Even though this is one of the weaker Gundam series it's still good and worth taking the time time to watch.
1	Best gundam show: I would consider this one of the best gundam series. Highly recommend if one were interested in any gundam series.
0	I got Snaked: This cable looks good, feels good, is easy to use, but only works if the ends are wiggled and twisted. I could not get it to connect correctly on two different amps and one electric guitar. Pass on this one. A lesson learned; you get what you pay for!
0	Assembly is a bit tricky: Disappointed that I found it impossible to assemble the stands. You have to watch out that there are different length pre-drilled holes at the different ends of the pillars. I also didn't have an extensive toolkit to be able to redrill and enlarge the pre-drilled holes to make the assembly much easier. Things were so tight, I couldn't drive the screws in even with a powertool. Otherwise they looked good quality construction and should suit smaller sized rear surround speakers. With appropriate planning you should be able to avoid breaking screws like I did. Onecall don't pay for return shipping and Sanus were happy to send replacement parts, but I decided to return the item anyway. Maybe you'll have more success.
1	Best Futuristic Maiden CD: This CD is another wonderful CD of legendary NWOHM Band Iron Maiden !!!Listen "Heaven Can't wait" and "Wasted Years" , and you'll see why these songs are in almost every Live Concerts of Maiden ....Particularly I love "Deja Vu", It's melodics chords make me feel in another place in another world.....Really It's fantastic...Also it's portrait is the best cover design of Maiden Albums....I recommend !!!!!
1	MASTERPIECE!!: Simply put, the best Iron Maiden album ever made. If you consider yourself even romotely a Maiden fan, you already own this album.

0	Barebones re-release: The He-man and She-ra Christmas Special has a special place close to my heart. This is why it makes me so sad to see such a barebones release. This DVD has absolutely no extras (well, it does have a chapter selection?). This is not even a remastered transfer. What makes this edition even more redundant is the fact that in 2005 there was another version that was loaded with extras.Skip this release as theHe-Man & She-Ra - A Christmas Special(2005) is the one you want. Unfortunately, it is out of print, but you can still get it from some sellers (albeit at a slightly higher price).
0	NOT A Learning Book: This book would have been better had it not included "Learning" in the title. This is not a book for learning how to program in Java. Instead, this book plays a lot more like an overview of core concepts in Java for practicing programmers. This book would probably have been better suited in the "Nutshell" series, but even as a reference, it's a rather weak text because it keeps pretending to be instructional. This book is pointless.This book is absolutely not for novice programmers. You have to have some experience with the C/C++ language and OOP concepts to really get the meat of this book.This book does include a *few* things that are nice for novices to know, but it's nothing you won't find in any other book on the topic.
1	no title: From the producers of "The Terminator" and "Aliens" and it shows. Practically nonstop mayhem. And very much like the last two Mad Max movies, particularly in the costumes, makeup, and the town, which somewhat resembled Barter Town. Liotta, however, is no Mel Gibson; there didn't seem to be that hardness at his core that Gibson can project. However, I did thoroughly enjoy it in spite of the constant violence. Was filmed in Australia, with some gorgeous scenery shots. But far too much violence and very graphic. Although its message was good. I would think some scenes here could cause nightmares among the young and the more susceptible. There's really nothing wrong with the movie's plot; it's just that we're now too good in the technical department, and can make violence so real these days. Maybe we need to downgrade here, and not be so graphic.
1	Pretty Good: Contrary to the other reviews,I didn't have any problems with these headphones. I had them hooked up in a few minutes, it was very simple. The only thing to wait for is the batteries to charge. I walked around the house and outside without any problems and was outside before I had a little distortion, but nothing too major. I wear a size 7 and 3 quarters baseball hat and had no trouble with these fitting my huge head. They are adjustable to somebody much smaller and also much larger than myself. I do think this is a great product considering JVC website has them for130 bucks and I bought them on Ebay for18 bucks new in the box. I will be buying these for my friends and family for Christmas, an excellent product.
0	Don't bother!: After reading mixed reviews, I purchased this product. It was to be used outside but wasn't tried out until several months later. BIG MISTAKE! I'm sure the HAW300RF is as bad. If you turn your head, you lose the signal even well within range even in the same room! Garbage!
0	Aurora Leigh from general books publishers: I bought this book (General Books edition) from Amazon, and am more than disappointed with it. It is scanned and unedited. It is illegible! Now I will have to buy another copy from a reputable publisher. EBB's poem is wonderful! This edition is simply unreadable!
0	A letdown: Doesn't even remotely compare (IMVHO) to her ecstatic1999 live offering, Electrica. The only saving grace is "Para De Chorar," the very funky club-style bonus track. Even favorites that could've saved this set (like usually-amazing "Ill Parole Negra") come off weak. And Mercury's vocals here (again, save the studio track) sound overworked and, at times, (dare I say) half-assed. I am a longtime fan of Daniela and her band, but this one disappointed on first few listens. Who knows, though. Maybe it'll grow on me. (Stranger things have happened...)
0	broke on the first use: I purchased this on the strength of the Mr. Clean name. Big mistake. The handle and mop head parted ways on the first use and refused to be reunited! There was no direction on the packaging on what to do if this happened, the web site was useless, and the 800 number isn't manned on weekends (which is when I do most of my cleaning). After thirty minutes of trying to fit the handle back onto the mop head, I gave up. Everytime I fit it together, the top popped off again. This was a waste of money and time. I would NOT recommend this product to anyone.
1	A Real Lesson that can be applied to life: Snow White-a tale of terror isn't just a tale that is merely entertainment. This tale actually teaches you about life. It's very real, dark and hopeful at the same time. I loved Lili and her courage to defeat the evil stepmother. I liked how it was a battle between good and evil. I think it has a lot to teach about vanity, jealousy, and deception. Not to forget, LOVE. Real Love! Lili was a courageous character and I aspire to be like her.
0	are you kidding me ? so much for the hype.: This movie couldn't hold our attention tonight. Painful to watch in so many ways. Gruesome, really dark take on snow white which looked interesting at first blush. If only there was something more than shock and bland dialogue! Just didn't do it for us. Given the positive reviews I guess we're in the minority.
1	I became a documentarian because of this film.: After seeing this film, I literally changed career paths from narrative to documentary filmmaking.It's authenticity and depth is unmatched by many other documentaries, probably due to the relationship between the documentarian and the subject. If you haven't seen Apocalypse Now, watch that first. I also recommend to anyone that loves Apocalypse Now to see this documentary, because you will have a greater appreciation for both of them.
0	Pact With The Devil doesnt pack a punch or a hit: This movie is about a man named Louis, played by Ethan Erickson (The In Crowd, Tv's Buffy The Vampire Slayer), and he becomes a model, and his manager is the wilyeyed Henry, played by Malcolm McDowell. McDowell tells Louis about the story of Dorian Gray and how he made a pact with the devil. Louis or Dorian now writes in blood and he soon has eternal youth. This very interesting movie gets it fuel towards the middle but it can't help it. Very predictable. Malcolm McDowell (A Clockwork Orange, I:Spy) is wasted in my mind and why the hell is this movie introducing Ethan Erickson? He has been in a movie or two before this and a tv series..come on people get with it. Erickson is an ok actor and he does some ok acting in this. Unspeakably boring for a while, then it gets a shot of something and then it goes into a coma.
0	Bad book: Although there are only a few books currently discussing about the internal of JVM, this book is the worst of them. It copies too many pages such as the bytecode semantics from the JVM specification by Sun Microsystems and these parts consume around half of the books. Also most contents not borrowed from JVM specification is far too simple to be an indepth discussion of JVM. It only took me 2 hours to read the whole book and to find out that it is a bad book.
0	Save your money...: This book tries to cover topics in a very abstract way. You do not get a feel for the components that make up a VI project. It barely touches on Design Time Controls. It just tells the user what these things are, I could have found that out by looking at the help files of VI. I need some pratical examples of how to use these components, which this book has miserably failed to provide. There is no source code availble on their web site either like they say. I went there and their web site kept giving me errors. In short, if you are looking for help on building useful sites buy another book.
0	Contents need more explanation and depth: A lots of mumble-jumble materials which never really materialized for once. The instructions at times can be very frustrating with its example and procedures on showing you how to use InterDev. In the end, for me anyway, I find other books, even if they were not specificly written for Visual Interdev 6, offered more useful references and materials that actually kept me refering back to them from time to time.
0	This Chair is bad: It would not support100lbs. It fell apart as soon as my hind end hit it. If your looking for an outdoors chair, DONT get this one! Just givin some info, SHADY
1	bread flour: Excellent quality flour for bread making. This is the 2nd time I have ordered it and will definitely continue!
0	uhhhhh: when i first heard this album it was garbage,now im in to hip hop like krs-one tribe called quest kweli,but this album is completely lacking tight lyrics or beats please dont buy this album unless you are collecting lol
0	Technically Inaccurate: I bought this book because I am working on a software project that involves Exchange 2000. However, the book's author does not use proper terminology. For example, they talk about SAM replication times but Exchange 2000 uses Active Directory. They talk about site connectors but Exchange 2000 uses Routing Group Connectors. I know this product is still in Beta, but RC2 is feature complete. This book could have been better. Only buy this if you absolutely need to implement Exchange 2000 ASAP. If you read Microsoft's documentation first, you can weed through this book for more details.
0	Recent purchase: I can't really say anything about the product because I have not recieved it. I bought the item in late September and was promised to be delievered early October but never recieved it. It is now October 31, and the item is still not here.
0	Piss poor unoriginal mallcore: Don't waste your time buying this garbage. This band has the worst singer, no memorable guitar hooks or riffs, some leads but isn't enough to redeem them from the hordes of crappy and redundant hardcore stylings. The bottom line is I've heard it done better by many other bands. If you want something that will expand your mind with crazy offbeats then I would recommend bands like Arsis, Dillenger Escape Plan,or anything by Mastadon. These guys suck and I have no idea why the hell they are touring with Megadeth. I hope they get booed off stage. They should have gotten Municipal Waste to open up.
0	Horrible Song: Nelly is doing more singing than Janet Jackson is on this clunker that alone spells trouble. dime a dozen track with no feeling or meaning. this is a ok B-side but not worthy of a lead off single&especially not worthy to remember the Control project from 20 years back. but Janet Jackson has been played out for well over a Decade to me&this song only adds to that point.
1	Good book, but Deathly Serious: Elvis Cole used to be more of a smartass and, I hate to say it, I miss the old smartass days. Now, everything is deathly serious and I'm having trouble enjoying Crais' books as much. It's a pity, too, because he's a good writer. It seems like, from time to time, writers write really great books and then get "serious" about their craft not realizing that the humor leavens the work and without it the writing pulls the reader down. This book puts people close and dear to Elvis in proximity to dangerous, evil people, subject matter much too grim for no smiles at all.
0	The LAst Detective Audio Book: I love the Elvis Cole Series by Robert Crais. I am not reviewing the author or the book, but my purchase. My CD was incomplete. It covered the first chapter, 31 minutes. The rest of the audio was deleted, or just wasn't there. I was very disappointed.The Last Detective (Elvis Cole) [Abridged][Audiobook] (Audio CD)Alvin
0	Surprized: I have been a fan of Robert Crais, thats why I was VERY SURPRIZED with The Last Detective. I was dissapointed at its length at first, 300 pages, but James Lee Burke can write a great book in just 300 pages, so, maybe can Crais. I was wrong! Very dissapointing. And what was the bear thing all about?
1	Elvis Cole is back again!: The return of Elvis Cole is well worth the wait. Robert Crais moves Elvis right into action during the first chapter. He is caring for his girlfriend's son and in just one moment the boy disappears. The ensuing search for the boy centers upon's Elvis's Vietnam memories, and a box hidden in his closet that contains medals and pictures. This is not a mystery solved easily- lots of turns and tangles. Old nemesis and the return of Carol Stanger from a previous novel keep this storyline fresh and right on the edge of your seat. Action and deep thought are all a part of the story. Elvis digs deep to keep his relationship with the boy's mom on an even keel, but this may bethe last chance that won't work out. The return of Det. Stangergives us renewed hope that she will be part of Elvis Cole's nextcase and maybe a new romance...
0	the stitching came apart in the left shoe tongue.: poor craftship when it came to the stitching. they look an feel good but, they started coming apart an I only wore them slightly.
1	Daigrepont's best album.: I'm a big fan of Daigrepont, but not always a fan of his albums, which are pretty uneven. When I want to hear him play this is what I put on.A lot of Cajun music is wedded to tradition, but Daigrepont feels free to experiment. "Bebe de la Famille," for example, has a Caribbean touch. "Bonjour, Dimanche," about a farmowner who's been up all night throwing a party and is listening to the countryside wake up at dawn, is the trickiest song here, simultaneously evoking the narrator's bleary state and the farmyard's early-morning bustle. Daigrepont is expanding the tradition, though, not leaving it behind. There's still bouncy party music like "Tipitina Two-Step," a slow one about his uncle's store where you could speak Cajun French and gamble, and covers of songs by Canray Fontenot and Wade Fruge.All of Daigrepont's albums have good songs, but this one's something special. The worst you can say about anything here is that it's merely good.
1	Mind Bomb does just that!!!: I have such a huge cd collection and I recently went back to listen to some cds I had not given some play in sometime. I cranked up Mind Bomb in the new system and this freakin' cd is so full of great guitar riffs, keyboards, and awesome vox's. It is so unfortunate that it did not get the respected air play in its time. I saw in them "live" here in San Antonio when they opened up for Robhalford's "Fight" project, and they kicked some ass. I recommend this cd. GET IT!!!!!! if you can find.
1	Great book: I chose this rating because it is so adventurous to me! I would recommend this book to anyone who likes immigration and labor movement. But even if you don't please at least try a sample of the book please!
1	You have to buy good books for your family: It's a very good book for my13'th daughter. We live in México and the english teachers recomended us to buy this book
1	I think this book is outstanding.: I'm reading "Letters From Rifka," and I think it is a real interesting book.I think this book is real interesting bacause its a really good mystery book.I mean you never know whats going to happen because Rifka is always getting into something new.THese are reasons why I adore "Letters From Rifka".
0	It never arrived: I paid for it, i need it next week, i've filed a claim, but still no book? How can i review a service when that service was never provided?I will update this review if and when i actually get what i paid for.James McDonald
1	A95 Disks: If you use the Canon A95, this disk is all you will need plus some. You will never run out of disk space. I like the ease of use and the large capacity. Chances are that if you are not a pro, the1mb disk may be too much space and you may only need something smaller like the 512mb.
0	Pricy: Of course as all things computer related, as soon as this was purchased the price dropped drastically. Unit works great but buy the 2 gig. More bang for the $$
0	Slow performance, bad for large megapixel cameras: My main problem with this Compact Flash is that the "real-time" performance is very slow. I bought it a year ago for my 5-Megapixel camera, and it makes me wait a long time before I can take my next photo. This gets frustrating when you miss good photo opportunities.Then, I read this article which reviews Compact Flash cards, and I realized that this particular SanDisk product line is inferior.The review at DP Review says this Sandisk writes at 6x (where 'x' =150 KB/sec). I since then, have purchased a 512MB Transcend compact flash which claims to Write at 25x. My camera works much faster now. I have borrowed my friend's IBM Microdrive and that is really fast too.
1	More phisolophical than technical for sure: The book provides some clues on how errors should be considered. It spends a lot of time describing the current situation in a very verbose style. OK that's fun but not very instructive (I mean, we all know half the messages are stupid, unfounded, incomprehensible, etc.). This beeing said I would recommend the book for the same reason....
1	Bulk Soaker Hose Comparison: Fiskars ceased making bulk soaker hose in 96'. Excellent product and system using there black and yellow compression fittings. I found an online retailer that carries the same product (part #120, .580 bulk soaker hose in100' 500' rolls) with many more items, hose sizes in there product lineup. It appears they have a new formula as of June of 2010, that works so much like the original Fiskars. The mfg. is [...]
0	okay but cheap looking: These earrings are not worth more than the $5 I paid, but they are cute and the company shipped all items promptly. The "dangle" part of the earring above the colored beads look like cheap plastic beads stacked on top of each other.
0	It [stinks]: How anyone could think this was scarier than the first is beyond me. It was so [weak]. Freddy was good for one movie okay, no more Freddy, he's dead face it, people don't like scary movies anymore, they like Scream. Horror is diseased. Too the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Friday the13th, Nightmare on Elm Street, and Halloween I'm sorry. RIP. We will no longer get real horror. We had a peak with The Exorcist, and went down hill from there. The first was scary, the rest [stink]!
1	A great horror movie:: This is a good movie. I love the nightmare on elm street movies.The last one isn't that good though but it's okay. The older ones are the best because they deal with teens. Patricia arquette plays in this. Buy it.
0	Dwarf Cichlids by david Boruchowiztz: I was very disappointed by this book. Vague and woolly. It didn't address the specifics needs for breeding Apistogrammas for example. Great pictures, but you can get great pictures free on the net. The quality of the photography is first rate and if you want a book just for browsing occasionally then its fine.
1	An original mix!: OK, this is an odd mix! but some of the tracks are great! It has everything from the blues to Ska! However, the track which will gain most attention is George Harrison's. Harrison's voice sounds in faltering shape! The Eric Clapton is a good track, and there are many gems in this album!
1	New Family Favorite!: I was so pleased to find this movie on DVD & at a great price! This movie was one of my most favorites as a child & now I am able to enjoy it with my fiance & kids. It is the perfect level of creepy & mystery for kids to enjoy & not end up terrified.
0	Boot Legged Product ???: The movie was like a boot legged video... NOT a Disney movie, NO Walt Disney Castle Credit or anything Disney. Beginning scene as I saw when I was younger was missing and you could see blippy black, white and yellow spots on the screen like you would see in an older projection film.No chapter/scene selections or anythingNOT worth the $18 ...
1	A Christmas Classic: I bought this CD when it first came out and it's still my favorite after all these years. She is at her best on this CD. A winner that is sure to please!
0	Mariah Carey: MC can't sing: she's just another Whitney Houston imitator whose only entertainment value is showing off her body!The traditional Christmas Carol "Joy to the World " track is positively contaminated, no.. blasphemed, by mixing in parts of the 3 Dog Nite song of the same title.In summary, this album SUCKS!!!
1	This is a must have...even if you have the original!: Two bonus songs...fantastic. The videos...fantastic.The video for "O Holy Night"...gives me the chills!The picture is so clear and her performance is flawless.Worth every penny to purchase this CD/DVD.Go now...buy it!
1	Loved it: Love me some Mariah Carey. This was actually a repurchase of a CD we wore out...had to get a new one.
0	A Bad Bad christmas album.: This album is so cheesy, it makes me wnat to puke and swallow my own intestines. What was Mariah thinking by producing such vomit-inducing rubbish!!!
0	Sappy, childish, commercial...: ...no depth at all in this CD. Mariah has no "angel" at all. Ridiculous CD. Don't get it.
0	Mariah has proven herself to be an industry tramp.......: 2005 has shown the true side of mariah, and has shown her greed and hatred for her fans. She knows that they will buy anything that has her name on it, and she is effectively exploiting this!!!!mariah is a ho ho ho ho ho ho!!
0	Legacy Yea Right!!!!!: Both The Lable & the Band are Guilty of Pissing Down the Leg of One of the true Great american Rock bands, Like The Other truely Great American Rock band (Cheap Trick) we have been bombarded with Cut rate compilations of past glory, What the band really has told it's fans is This, We have nothing Tangible to say we have milked our cow dry But we are not quite done Fleecing you so Give us your money because we spent most of our fortune sticking things In our noses & veins so Give us more money beause we are now addicted to your hard earned Cash. stay away from this & all further released albums by this band until they give us more than Hits or Live compilations or Rehashed Blues numbers from artists who did them better in the first place save you money & buy yourself a Muddy Waters CD or a willie Dixon cd see where these rip off artists bit thier style from in the first place
1	Now they saying Ms. before they mention your name, girl!: I feel as though I have been waiting on this CD forever. I have always been a Kelly fan, even back in the day when she with "Beyonce & the other girls", also know as Destiny's child.Beyonce has an overpowering voice that at times can get annoying, although I still love her, but Kelly's voice more soft and smooth. This cd showcases her talents as singer as well as a talented writer.After the BET awards, I was a little afraid as to what this cd might sound like, however after listening to the cd, I've decided that I will just chalk up the bad performance to nerves.I can't wait for more from Ms Kelly.Track Listings and ratings.1.Like This - 4/52.Comeback 5/5 One of my favorites3.Ghetto - 4/54.Work - 5/55.Flashback-3/56.Every Thought is You 4/57.The Show- 4/58.Interlude9.Still In Love With My Ex 5/510.Love - 4/511.Better Without You - 5/512.This is Love-3/5I just wish there were more songs!!!
0	Teach yourself how not to waste money on worthless books.: Not only did I waste money on this worthless book, I wasted a fortune on trying to sell my home using the advise of this guy. By the time I'm done, what little profit I made will surely go to my attorney to keep the buyers of my home off my back.
1	Great Hardy: Good book. Hardy's descriptions of astronomy are beautiful. The characters of Lady Constantine and Swithin are well developed, and Swithin's conflict between love and science moves the book.If I have one complaint, the characters apart from Constantine and Swithin aren't as well developed as a book like Far from the Madding crowd. Jan Coggan, the Maltster, and Laban Tall are one of the best parts of Far from the Madding Crowd, and that is missing from this book. The parson is developed, but he's not funny or lively.
1	Another Unhappy Hardy Ending: If you like Thomas Hardy and unhappy endings, then you will like this book. This Jude the Obscure meets The Return of the Native, but shorter.
1	Greatest movie ever: What can I say? This is my favorite movie. Don't buy it tho unless your a deep thinker that sees lots of depth in zombie movies. Enjoy!!!
0	No.: This movie makes no sense.The title character is introduced as an immoral zombie-killer, who picks up grieving trophy wife bimbos at the cemetery where he works. Later he transitions into a blubbery psychotic mess over the loss of a chick he knew for two days and didn't even seal the deal with. Only to meet multiples of her, one of whom has a phobia of erections...If you LOVE zombie movies, stay away. The makeup is terrible, the acting is mediocre, plot? What plot? The zombie action is boring. There's no connection with any of the characters and you spend the last 3/4 of the movie hoping everyone dies.
1	Dark atmosphere, sexy love interest, great gore!!: Having seem my share of zombie flicks I still can't bring myself to seriously consider them fine film making, but Dellamorte Dellamore comes the closest to keeping my interest for the entire screening.Taking place in old cemetary in Italy, Rupert Everett plays a cemetery watchman who matter-of-factly dispatches zombies with the coolness of Clint Eastwood in a Spaghetti Western using his trusty sidearm.I must confess the acting, aside from Rupert's is 'B' movie quality, but I was consistantly drawn into the movie's eerie setsand the antics of baffoonishly sickening sidekick Gnaghi, played by Francois Hadji-Lazaro and naturally Anna Falchi is a sight to behold by any standards.The gore effects are above average and serve the story in appropriate quanities.I've not seen other films directed by Michael Sovai but this one makes me hope I do. According to IMDB this is the last movie he's made, apparently not a most prolific director.
0	Extremely Disappointing!: All of these positive reviews, calling this the greatest movie of all time are way off base. What makes this movie so great? There are tons of Italian Zombie movies out there and a good 95% of them are better than this drivel.After reading all of these reviews calling this a "classic" I went in expecting something of an "Evil Dead" or "Dead Alive" type of film which are filled with gore and have some nice comedic bits. "Cemetery Man" is simply BORING, that's right it BORING! Slowly paced, dim witted and down right JUNK!If you want to see a good Italian zombie flick check out some of Lucio Fulci's work like "Zombie", "City of The Living Dead" or "The Beyond" all superior works compared to this god awful movie. Save yourself about 2 hours of your life and stay away from this extremely boring film.
0	Terrible movie: This was a total waste of 90 minutes of my life. Terrible, boring, stupid, and senseless don't begin to describe this waste of film. How anyone can rate it 4 or 5 starts is beyond me. I think I'm open minded. I watch horror, slasher, foreign and suspense films all the time. This has nothing going for it. It is NOT scary in the least. And the special effects are about as well done as a high school play. This is just garbage. I would have given it zero stars, but that's not an option.
0	Cemetary Man: Italians are good at Gore, but fail at plot. The movie plot was all over the place. DO NOT waste you time watching more Italian gory junk!
0	More of the same: Yet another movie that presents the psuedo-gospel of "get right with God so you don't have to go to hell with all the other sinners". If you've seen left behind, omega code, etc. This is only different in having a smaller budget, smaller plot, and equally bad acting. Someone please start making movies about the life of fullness and great joy that Jesus invited people to rather than another fire insurance movie like this one. How many do we need? Who are they for? I am sure God can use this for His glory and purposes, but I found it rather dissappointing.
1	Christian movie for Anyone. Plus the Rapture.: The sign of the times are all present and sooner or later the world dictator will make his debut onto the world scene. The movie "Six" even though it is a movie is a close representation of what it will be like in a couple of years. Six talks about the Tribulation time in where all people on this earth will have to use a mark on there right hand or forehead in order to buy and sell anything in the market. The cash society will be non-existent. This is a great movie for the Christian person and for the person who does not know Jesus Christ and who wants to, who wants to change to the Christian Religion. People laugh at this time from ever occurring but if you look at the news things are going on which only indicate that the Lord will be coming soon.Pray alot, and hope to get picked up during the Rapture. As for Six the movie, get it, and watch it, and learn from it.
0	continued disappointment: The author puts forth a "New view' and changes his story characters so then I didn't get my wish of 'how I would have hoped Soalme's d. turned out.'
1	Excelent book: I received my book from within15days insteadof 8 weeks they told me, excelent and i love this item, signed as they said, very nice buy.
0	THE ALBUM THAT ALMOST DESTROYED HELLOWEEN....: In this album Helloween tried something new, but without a clear direction the album turned out to be a loser, confusing his hard-core fans and gaining almost none new ones.
0	''Why Helloween Why'': This one is nothing compare with the oder helloween albuns.Chameleon and Pink bubles don't have the real heloween music. I prefere the bands new and old albuns.
0	WORST HELLOWEEN ALBUM: Why can't people recognize the fact that after Kai Hansen left, Helloween was gone for sure ?? See what Gamma Ray is doing and compare it with what Helloween has been doing ... Anyway, I'm not saying that all Helloween albuns after Michael Weikath took control are horrible. But this "CHAMELEON" is. It is exactly whjat its name means: a transformation of metal into garbage.
0	Piece of junk: Helloween almost was destroyed forever after this turkey, who flopped simpkly because it really was that bad. The band tried to "innovate", adding a lot of keyboards, horns and whatever, in a mixture of poorly written songs that nobody will ever remember, and that were scrapped forever from their live set. AS a result, singer Michael Kiske and drummer Ingo Schwichtenberg were fired (for differente reasons), the band lost their contract with EMI and had to start all over agains, never totally recovered from guitarrist Kai Hansen's loss.
0	Good unit except.....: As a previous poster already stated this unit only supports up to 2GB SD cards. Unless Philips releases a firmware update for SDHC cards or you have a large supply of 2GB or less SD cards stay away from this unit. Other than this major shortcoming, it's a pretty good device.
1	WONDERFUL ENTERTAINTMENT: Don't seek any academic insights from this book. This is a piece of pure entertainment, full of memories and anecdotes that can brighten up a hundred dinner tables over the years. Hoveyda was a founder of France's snootiest film review, the Cahiers du Cinema, but writes with the ease and wit of a free spirit. While recalling his friendship with many of the innovative film-makers of the last century, Hoveyda also debunks some of the myths about the New Wave and independent cinema. A READER IN LONDON
1	Ooooooh my Godddddddddd !!!: Like most of Betty Carter's albums, this one demands patience, attention, availability. You cannnot appreciate HER music if you want to discover all the riches at once. If you're a man, you got to be a gentleman. It's been three days now that I keep listening to "It's not about the melody". I did not want to talk about it, because it's so beautiful... You know what I mean? It's a bit like when you got a beautiful girlfriend, you're not going to yell at everybody that you've got a beautiful girl friend, are you?... See what I mean? ... Huh, what did I say? nothing. OK, I must be going now........
1	Excellent and forceful: The stories are of two types here -- short, one page sketches that verge on being prose poems, and longer, fuller stories which still contain an elusive quality. Although critics, to a man, preferred the longer stories, I find the shorter ones equally compelling. The writing is first-rate; it is nuanced, poetic, and contains a wealth of psychological insight. I think this is Phillps's greatest accomplishment: her merging of the psychological and the political in stories that are always accessible. Those looking for pretension will find it only with reviewers who trash sophisticated story-tellers while including the (see more about me) tag at the beginning of their own reviews.
0	Didn't much care for it.: I didn't much cre for this book. It had too much sex stuff and not really any stories to follow. I thought it would be a good book, too since other well-known authors have praised it so well. I do not see what all the fuss was about.
0	Say, wha?: Um, can you say one of the worst movies ever? The only man that fell here was me..falling for the price of renting this horrible movie! Lifeless, dreary, and humorless. Perhaps has something to do with the depressing plot: A loser janitor (Dylan Baker), listens to opera and has emotional and social issues. Fast forward to he meets up with another loser (Hutton), and his loser shop-lifting wife (Stone). Stone looks stoned. Stone looks yucky. Somewhere I lost interest. I think it was like right after the opening credits. No. Maybe it was the awful acting. Still, it could have been the lack of a coherent plot, I don't really know or care. But if you want a "gripping psychological thriller" as the box claims, then you'll do yourself a favor and keep looking. What a waste of talent.
1	Lots of good Information and facts.: This book helps a lot. It teaches you how to train, when to train, what sorts of things you should do, and different foods to eat. This will help you prepare. It is a great purchase.
0	bad to the bone: this movie sucked, it was better than the dreamchild but the worst one, the deaths were ridiculous and it had to much humour, the ending was a total let down, the fight between Freddy and his daughter was not a big finale, this movie was a waste of my time, and if your looking for a good movie, this is not a good choice, even die hard freddy fans won't like this, even the acting was bad, don't rent this or buy it, worst Freddy movie
1	"I'll get you my pretty and your little soul too": I loved this Nightmare film, this, the1st one and the 3rd are my top fav 3 out the series.This one has no horror, but it has the most comedy ever, Freddy will make you laugh your ass off in this one.My fav part is when hes playing the video game, so brilliant. And when hes messing with that dude with the ear plug, really cool.
0	Is Freddy dead yet?: Just a typical Freddy sequel that is actually quite good. A few good deaths and wise cracks. Although they seemed to finish Freddy off quite quickly that it would seem like they had another sequel planned.
0	sucked!!!: this one just stunk overall there is no dought about that. after 5 I thought it couldn't get worse, well it did in this one.
1	Freddy's done it again!: This movie was great. Robert Englund was holarious. The graphics and special effects were great. I thought there could been more body count though. It was a great combination of horror and comedy. I think you should see it.
0	0 STARS: AWFUL!!: "Freddy's Dead- The Final Nightmare" is a terrible installment to what was a great horror movie series. This movie is a total joke just like the previous two sequels before it...this garbage, a horror movie?? Give me a break!! This movie is not scary...it's ridiculous!! I highly recommend sticking with parts1-3, which are undoubtedly the only "NOES" movies that should have ever been made. This movie sucks...shame on the people that made this trash.
0	3-D Sequences barely save this sub-par finish to the series: To fully appreciate this film you have to either seen it in the theater or have a DVD player. The 3D sequence is the film's saving glory. The film seems like it was rushed because the script is bland. I think if the film had brought back Wes Craven then maybe it would've been a superior finish to one of the greatest film series in history.
0	Same ol' song and dance: A friend of mine bought this book and shouldn't have. Laura Schellhardt isn't a seasoned pro at screenwriting, she is a TEACHER. Not a good one at that.Yes, the book is informative, but it doesn't say anything different that any other book does, other than the Screenwriter's Bible by David Trottier. Trottier is a professional writer with numerous credits under his belt. So my advice is to "Schell" out an extra dollar so you can buy the Screenwriter's Bible and just leave Screenwriting for Dummies alone.
0	Pseudo-science: Lomborg's book may appear to consist of logical arguments, and therefore appeals to many, but closer examination reveals this not to be the case.I would urge other readers of the book to treat Lomborg's work with the same view to skepticism as Lomborg himself...
0	Soft targets and biased selection: This book pays little attention to the peer reviewed scientific literature on environmental problems. That is the basis for policy and has established the seriousness of many environmental problems. In addition to picking "soft targets" of writings by advocates, the book ignores inflated claims by industry about the economic losses that will accompany environmental regulation. This demonstrates its lack of balance.
0	Very misleading and shallow: So many people will believe anything they read if it agrees with their beliefs. This book contains errors and distortions. Unfortunately, the reviewers just add to the confusion. For example:"...government workers faked lynx presence..." Sorry, it didn't happen. Read the follow-ups, not just the first headline. Visit the Audubon Magazine website for a comprehensive article on the incident.The marine harvest data is flawed. China has been lying about their catches for years. Even the not very left-leaning U.S. News reported that yields have been dropping dramatically. "Marine sleuths find that faulty numbers from Beijing have masked a worldwide drop in catches".This book is recommended for the person who wants to refute arguments about environmental problems and doesn't care about accuracy and facts.
0	Outdated and Uneducated: An environmental book written by a statistician! 90% of all statistics can be used to show either side of the argument 50% of the time! This author uses this skill liberally.The first chapter makes a very valid point: be aware of what you're reading and be skeptical! The rest of the book is slanted toward his OPINION and he disregards information that doesn't support his viewpoints.Many things may not be as bad as some portray but they aren't as rosy as this author portrays either. READ WITH SKEPTICISM!!
0	Not the best: Wether this verson has been updated and cleaned up, doesn't really matter.What I've seen is a very poor recording, very bad sound (that makes it hard to hear what is being said),and bad picture quality.A film from the master of suspence should be given the recognition it deserves.
1	Singing voice that mind gets warm: It is a famous piece of music collection which keeps being eternally heard.
0	ULTIMATE RIP-OFF: Do not purchase this download. Track15 has a serious glitch in it at about 2:30 seconds. It may well be in the master, too.
1	Great!: So many people have never taken him seriously. That's because they have no understanding of talent or superb craftsmanship. A great example is in the one star review below. Sigh. Making fun of him is pretty cliche. It went out of style 20 years ago. Maybe it's time the naysayers grew up a little. People might of made fun of him, but guess what?. 20 some years later and he is still here!. This CD debuted at number 3 on the charts in a world filled with Britneys and Limp Bizkits. Mr. Manilow has definitley gotten the last laugh. The detractors can laugh all you want, but it won't amount to a hill of beans. He proved himself decades and decades ago and is still doing it. Laughing at him is as meaningless as ever.
0	King of Kitsch: It is unfathomable that here, in the early days of the 21st century, there are still people who not only listen to the King of Kitsch, but will own up to it. There is a reason why Barry Manilow has spent the better part of a quarter of a century being the punchline of jokes and twenty of those reason can be found here. Sappy songs galore, almost all having the same "beautiful music" structure of slow tempo throughout each verse and chorus, before ending in a bombastic crescendo. Sadly these songs can still be heard in elevators and dentist offices across America. Even sadder is that people will pay to hear them again at home.
0	MANILOW A HUMPERDINCK WANT TO BE: MANILOW SHOULD JUST HANG IT UP.HE SHOULD GO BACK TO PERFORMING IN BATH HOUSES.BETWEEN A BIG NOSE AND A VERY AUDIBLE LISP THIS GUY CRUCIFIES THE MEANING OF ROMANTIC MUSIC.HE IS A ENGELBERT HUMPERDINCK WANNA BE.MAYBE HE CAN GET A GIG SHINING ENGELBERTS SHOES!IF HE IS LUCKY!
0	For Cultural Lemmings Everywhere: Please! Five stars for a collection of the sappiest songs of all time? It is pretty hard to take seriously someone who claims to have invented music ("I am music and I write the songs") yet the abundance of five star reviews here proves that PT Barnium was right....
1	AWESOME, AWESOME, AWESOME!!!!!: I was so excited when this finally arrived in the mail! I have been listening to it non stop... It certainly takes me back and reminds me of all of the good and special times in my life. This is a great CD with all of the songs you love to sing along with. Enjoy!
0	It's a shame cos it's a good movie..: ..between horror and deep emotions with a capital fault:What the hell they think they are in giving us a clear statement against euthanasia??? We are no longer in the middle age I thought.. Even for American standarts this should cause a big scandal!
0	Absolutely horrible: Absolutely horrible.1 star at best. What's there not to like? The acting is absolutely horrible. The special effects, especially the make-up, look amateur - the blood (and there is lots of it) looks very fake. Email me if you disagree. I hope I find a buyer for this DVD when I sell it on ebay...
0	Yawn!: I thought the plot really dragged in this sappy, semi-scary film about a young women who's frightened of hospitals, but has to go into one to rescue her husband. Of course, in conquering her fears she saves his life, blah, blah, blah. Her husband, meanwhile, discovers that four of the nurses are blood-drinking lesbians in one of the most blatantly stupid scenes in the entire film. Clearly, somebody on the production staff must have realized that this film was a dud and that perhaps by adding a completely unimaginative girl/girl/girl/girl encounter they could somehow save it. But alas, this film is one patient that was beyond saving.
0	Don't even bother - save your money: The DVD is a dissapointment. Over1/2 of the music footage is missing.It's a "tribute" concert, yet the biggest tribute to Freddie, Extremes medley of Queen songs (which is BY FAR the show stealer) and them performing "Love of my Life" w/ Brian May are stricken from the DVD.Do yourself a favor, hunt down the VHS copy. If you threw out your VCR, it's worth buying another one to watch it with.
1	Great Concert: hearing George Michael do SOmebody to Love was a great Moment on this set.ELton John&Axel ROse Dueting was something special as well.it was a great tribute.Seal,Annie Lennox,Bowie,ETC.. made this a Special COncert.
1	Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert: An awesome concert of superstars as a tribute to one of the greatest vocalist of all time. I still have the original VHS tape and love it. This DVD (finally) is a must for all the fans of Queen and Rock & Roll music.
0	Smells nice, doesn't last: Smells great...doesn't last that long. Thought it was me, asked others...they all agreed. We couldn't smell anything after a couple of hours. What a waste of money.
1	Loves kitty: We started using this gym when our son was 2 months old. He absolutely loved it. Every time we spun the ball and the cat made music our son went crazy with glee. He is now 41/2 months old and he still likes it, but he does seem to get bored with it quicker and he likes his larger play mat better.
0	boring...: Thought that this was very cute and had many things to do however I think it looks better than it actually is. My daughter really could have cared less about the entire thing. There really is only 4 things hanging down and they really don't go OVER the baby. I think that the entire point of a baby gym is to have the toys over the baby to reach out a grab. This is a total miss.
0	Do yourself a favour, do NOT buy this book!: Note the worst book in the world, but fairly darn close. I bought three study guides for this exam and the only one that seemed to be helpful was the Coriolis Exam Prep by Talbert. It got a bit detailed in parts but was the clear winner of the three I read.
1	great scary movie from wes craven!: I find this movie very well done, it has a lot of scenes that would probably at least make you a little bit scared. This film has good acting by Heather Langenkamp(Nancy Thomson) and Johnny Depp(Glenn) and by Robert Englund(freddy). If you are in the mood to watch a horror film then this is one film that you should not miss
1	Iconic slasher flick: This is it. The film that introduced the world to Horror icon Freddy Krueger. Of course Freddy wasn't the ONLY slasher in the '80s (with Michael Meyers and Jason Voorhees), but to me, Freddy is the absolute best! There are plenty of moments that'll make you jump out of your seat and there are also some just plain downright disturbing moments. If you're a fan of slasher flicks then this movie is definitely a must-see!5 stars/5
1	One of the best horror movies of all time: Fred Krueger, a psychotic child murderer that was torched in his boiler room by the enraged parents of elm street. Ten years later he returns and this time he slashes kids in their dreams. This movie is fun and entertaining, no doubt Wes Craven's best movie. Unfortunately it had to be followed by a couple of try hard sequels.
1	The beginning of your nightmares!: This is the first Nightmare on Elm Street and it rocks! How many people out there have been scared by Freddy? Millions! In the movie Freddy attacks you in your dreams, and he makes your life miserable. I first watched this movie when I was seven and it scared the living daylight out of me! Ofcourse going to sleep is hard after you watch this movie cause you think Freddy is after you, and he is.... nah, Im just kidding. So anyways, if you want to enjoy a good movie, A Nightmare on Elm Street is the one, I mean, look at all the sequels it has, its a great flick!
1	SENUOUS AND SENATIONAL FROM START TO FINISH: I LOVE THIS MAN AND HIS WAY WITH A SONG. SMOOTH AND FLUID; FILLED WITH PASSIONATE AND POETIC LYRICS.LISTEN TO "BUT BEAUTIFUL", THE CLASSIC JOHNNY BURKE BALLAD. IT LEAVES A LUMP IN THE THROAT.LUCIEN TAKES HIS TIME AND IT'S A PLEASURE!
1	Very Interesting View of The Future: I really liked this book, although there were some parts to it that I didn`t understand. The author creates a future world, where humans are genetically engineered to "be happy". I think the idea behind this book is to point out some of the weaknesses of our society (eg. our reluctance to face our problems - we tend to take some "soma" instead, which is a widely used drug in the book to make people forget their problems)and to make us aware of what could happen in the future to humanity if we aren`t careful. The future described in the novel is very realistic and some of it is already starting to show up - whether we like it or not. When reading the book, you get the feeling (or maybe you don`t) that something is wrong with this future world. Engineering people to work and be happy is wrong, because the happiness they are feeling is not real. I guess it doesn`t make any sense now, but after reading the book it gives you something to think about. A great book!
0	Hmm...: I don't get it. It's very unusual. Controversial in its time, but still widely read throughout schools in the United States. I must say it wasn't all bad, the ideas he portrayed were revolutionary and original, although I was extremely let down at the end. It is clever that drugs aren't for pleasure anymore, they are everyday, for the use of increasing entertainment. That's how someone explained their interpretation, but I still [dislike] my English teacher for making me read it. It just seemed as if I was being led to believe one thing throughout, expecting some kind of epiphany, but got a guy walking in circles at the top of the stairs...
0	I expected so much more from such a high-rated novel: I was so enthusiastic and worked up to expecting a splendid and original read, but came off greatly dissapointed and got frustrated trying to think of what all the hype was about with BRAVE NEW WORLD. I tried so very hard to like and enjoy reading this...but my mind just didn't want to cooperate. Such a complex and creepy look into a superfical world into this book was hard to grasp, this just wasn't the type of book I expected. I prefered1984 and Animal Farm much more than Brave New World. I mean, it's hard to say that emotions can errupture with just a little pill, and vice versa. Oh well, maybe I'm a bit tuff to give such a beloved classic just1 star, but that's what I deeply and truely think this book deserves. I'll stick to my old favorites: Eliot, Hardy, Orwell, Willa Cather, Wharton, Dreiser, and Gustave Flaubert. Hehe, I never get to tired of my favorites. Viz., I didn't like this classic.
0	The ultimate in idiocy: A world where nobody is unhappy... this is supposed to be a bad thing in Huxley's story. What nonsense.I find it strange that Huxley supposedly had any affinity towards buddhism... The ultimate goal in buddhism is the ending of suffering... other things... freedom, love etc... are unimportant next to this. To say that you want to "keep the right to be unhappy" (as one of the characters in the book says) is the most unbuddhist thing anyone could say...What stupidity... taking pride in your ability to be unhappy...
0	Doesn't fulfil even the lowest requirements for fiction: I don't understand why Mr. Huxley is so famous. Okay, he has a very strong message, but then, his writing skills are non-existent. This book completely lacks fantasy and originality. As a result, the possible appeal of Mr. Huxley's ideas is overweighed in a hundredfold by the despise his "prose" (sorry for using this word here!) makes you feel. How is one supposed to enjoy the beauty of a wonderful landscape by a scribble of a three-year-old? Instead of this "novel", Mr. Huxley should have written a short newspaper article titled "Things I Don't Like".If Mr. Huxley is a writer, anybody who talks is a linguist. Reading this book leaves one perplexed - how could the author voluntarily expose himself to such ridicule?
1	into medialis they do go, yes: there were corollary tendency. without sshining light the new generation do you? uh?
1	Great Classic: This book is a great classic of Sci-Fi, couldn't put it down read it in two days and was very engaging.
0	Not all it's cracked up to be: Brave New World has many thought-provoking ideas. To dream up an utopia in Huxley's time is genious, but the story is not. I read this story for eighth grade, and though it had some things that i'm sure no one had ever thought of before then, they have now. It's not good enough to have a good ides, you have to write well, too.
1	Pleasently Surprised: I picked this book up at a rummage sale to add to my little library of books. I didn't plan on reading it for quite awhile... until I learned that this book was banned when it was first published in1932. This is scifi at it's best. There is a lot of scientific information, but not so much that the reader has to re-read every single paragraph to figure things out. There is a very easy to follow story with some great turns, interesting characters, and a picture that is built for the mind to see. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone under17 due to the sexual nature of the book, but I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a really interesting read.
0	1984 was much more enjoyable...: A decent book, but compared to1984, this book was not that good. Orwell's1984 was much more enjoyable to read whereas, at times, I felt lost with Brave New World. The line between protagonist and antagonist seemed blurred throughout this book until the end. Perhaps I should read it again to better understand the plot, but overall, I thought1984 was a better read.
0	open your eyes, read it, THEN THROW IT AWAY: BNW a novel with many labels: utopian, dystopian, sci fi, a metaphor of the present, a warning of the future, a great book, a companion to1984...I only half read it in high school. I don't think it should be part of standard curriculum, just as I don't think Fahrenheit 451 should be. Huxley and Bradbury's bursting desire to make the world aware of the disorienting menace of media and information control is wasted on adolescents.The book IS thought-provoking, though I wish it had been a short story. As such it would never as been as popular: the characters ARE interesting, but Huxley relies upon THEM to explain everything. The only descriptions are left to them, and as storytellers, they all fall far short of extraordinary.This is not a world I would want to live in.And1984 is better written.
1	Best Negative Utopia I've read (And Yes I read1984): I have to say right off the bat that this is one of the greatest books I ever read. Everyone already commented on the glimpse of the future...chilling totalitarianism, yada yada yada...I'd love to give you a complete analysis of the book, but it's10:30 and I'm tired. THe story is thourougly engaging, kept me enticed until the end...kind of expected it, but in another sense it cought me completely off guard...it was a masterpiece...better than1984, which, while quite cool, struck the reviewer(I have to refer to myself in the third person once per review...it's policy :)) as a bit dry and tedious.
1	An ominous warning of a possible future. A must read!: Aldous Huxley grips the mind, and keeps you locked to this book as he describes a future, one which is completely homogenius and conformed. Practices like artificial conception and genetic tampering are the standard in this uniform society, where very few choices are allowed, and questions are rarely heard. Huxley skillfully describes this gloomy premonition in incredible detail, and in many instances, including artificial insemination and genetic altering, he predicted the actual future. If it does nothing else, this book should send an ominous signal to today's society.This book is a must read!<BR
1	Fantastic light: I bought this for my husband for Christmas and he thinks it's the best headlamp he's ever used. He's amazed at the long battery life and the bright lite. We live in the Cascades and he uses it all the time either for work or even to get firewood at night.
1	Great reliable headlight!: I have used this headlight for weeks now in hunting and camp situations and found it to be exactly as advertised.It is very good quality and the run time is nice. I use it mostly on low and it lasts very well with the 2-AAA batteries it uses which by the way are another reason I tried this in the first place because AAA are common and available as well as cheap to use. The Enduro is awesome for the price and the high setting is pretty good for about anything within reason for a light of this caliber. I can't speak of its waterproof design but it looks like it will take a drenching with no problem with the oring seal it has in the battery compartment cap.You can't go wrong for the money.
1	good light: Super light, cant even feel it on your head. also good because you can clip it to your hat too. 2aa batteries, better than most compact lights which require 3aa. bright enough to do any working task. highly recommend it.
1	Good book for beginners: The book raises a lot of issues that need to be dealt with in designing a web site. This is not a book on how to create a web page. A lot of the material in the book is common sense, but good as a refresher. The book is well written and easy to read.
0	Slow and obvious: This book may be OK if you've just been put in charge of an intranet and have never used the web before. If you have spent more than a week surfing the internet in your life, you will feel, as I did, that this book states and restates the blindingly obvious ad nauseum. I actually failed to finish this book, I found it so terribly dry and unenlightening. Another thing that really bugs me about it is that the authors pose question after question, but never really supply an answer. Sometimes they make tentative suggestions that this-may-work-then, but never many good examples. They also reference screenshots of one little area of a given website, but this doesn't work because (if you believe the basic premise of the book) a website is a coherent item, not a distinct set of pages. Therefore highlighting specific elements of a website out of context is meaningless. Better spend your time surfing the web and thinking for yourself why some sites work and some don't.
0	Waste if time; waste of money: I should start by saying I didn't read the whole book. That's because I found it insulting that we were to believe this was a true biography. I resented the author passing off what he thought Gene Kelly must have been thinking during the AFI awards, I disliked the author painting Gene Kelly as mean-spirited and shallow. It was maddening to have the beginning of every chapter fractured with this conjecture. I considered this a total waste of money. Although I freely share my books with others, this book has been consigned to the role of doorstop.
1	Great country/rock: Excellent product with great vocals. We do a fast line dance to "Dance". Great CD with lots to like!
1	Good, Quality Cable: I have used this cable for a few years for recording my Casio electronic piano onto my computer and I love it. Once you set it up for the first time, it is quick and easy to use with a nice sound quality.
1	Every Christian should read this book!: The church has not acted with love toward the Jewish people. This book explains why we, as Christians, should be more appreciate of them and why we owe them a debt of gratitude. Be prepared to learn a lot!
1	Babylon & Ting: OK, so everyone already knows the reputation that this early orb effort carries, tracks such as OOBE and Blue Room are widely recognised as chill-dub classics. The fact is that this album is the epitomy of what makes the orb, the orb....The songs are long and consist of layoured soundscape backdrops for dub rhythms and drifting samples. This album is an extremely accomplished work, which changes tempo, style and even volume with no flaw as you move through the tracks.Blue Room is a favourite track of mine and I wish I had the single, Wobbles bassline adds to the track immensely. Towers of Dub follows it and gives the listener an insight into the orb's sense of humour (you need to have seen Victor Lewis-Smith's TV work) which is black at the best.If you have [the money] in your pocket and your in a music store knowing that this is the only album you will ever buy, go on - endulge me and try this.
1	Space Dub: This is it - the "Blue Room" space-ambient extravanganza from the Orb. Great free-ranging basslines traverse the unknown while little voices whisper in our ears. The second CD contains several outstanding "Blue Room" versions. SO sweet.
0	Boring, but not the worst in the series: If you're a fan of the NOES series, you'll probably end up seeing this one, but let me tell you, it's the same plot they've been using since the original. It's sad. To the point: to rate this movie is hard, but all you have to do is compare it to the rest of the series, and compared to #5: The Dream Child, it's way better. Don't be fooled, this is still a real bore!
1	PURE EVIL NEVER REALLY DIES!: Proving there's no rest for the wicked,the unspeakable,evil Freddy Krueger(RobertEnglund)is again resurrected from the grave to wreak havoc upon those who dare to dream.But this time,he faces a powerful new adversary!As her friends succumb one by one to Freddy's wrath,telephathically gifted Kristen(TuesdayKnight) embarks on a desperate mission to destroy the dream stalker and release the souls of his victms once and for all.After Kristen gets killed her friend Alice(LisaWilcox)is the world's only hope.Alice now has Kristen's powers she is a DREAM MASTER.After Alice's friends start to die including her older brother,Alice prepares to fight the deadly killer for the last time.After Alice kills Freddy she goes home to her boyfriend.

0	Not easy to dance to: I was so disappointed with this dance video! It is so confusing and not fun at all. She will say in the video now go to your right and she is going left and I don't know which way to go. When she says dance to the left she is going to the right. They should have done this video in front of a mirror. Big disappointment.
0	garden gnome: A real let down the pictures look so good, but in reality they are very small and get lost outdoors in a garden setting, the plants overwhelm them, good price but they are not very practical
0	Only the obvious copied and pasted: This book I found rather disappointing. It is DEFINITELY for the beginner. So much that most information is nearly copied from all the help information provided during the installation process itself.If you are a beginner I would not recommend buying this book. Look for something else!!
0	Penelope lays an egg: Fans of the original Hal Roach series should be outraged at this piece of junk, which is highly overrated at even one star. The cast of look-alike children are completely devoid of talent, the script is wretched, and the direction is even worse. P.U.!!
1	A great movie for kids: The Little Rascals (1994), *****, starring Travis Tedford, Kevin Jamal Woods, Jordan Warkol, Zachary Mabry, Ross Bagley.I first saw this movie on the exclusive Starz On Demand service that came with Comcast Cable. I love the Little Rascals and that is my main reason for watching it again and again. In the movie, I love how there's every main movie genre--excluding science-fiction and fantasy and animation. There's romance when Alfalfa (Bug Hall) woos his words of love to his young soulmate Darla (Brittany Ashton Holmes). There's drama when Waldo interferes in the budding, inseparable relationship between Alfalfa and Darla. There's comedy when Alfalfa goes about half-naked when he undresses from the ballerina costume and when Butch (Sam Saletta) and Woim (Blake Jeremy Collins). There's plenty of action during the cross-city go-kart race. That's the best part of the whole movie. I recommend this film for male and female, young and old. There's everything for everybody.
1	Best Kids Move Ever: I've never seen any child who didn't want to watch this move at least twice if not three times.
0	disappointed: I was extremely disappointed and caught very off guard by this book. I completed this book with a women's group and couldn't believe the point of view. I felt like the book expected and told women that they should be "June Cleaver". Very disappointed in the message that women should have no say so in anything and just fall to the feet of their man. Also, I did not understand how this book's message was in any way the message given in the bible as to what a wife should strive to be.
0	Very statistical: I was kind of dissapointed with this material. It only talks about statistics... more like a thesis or something...Was hoping something more conductual-psychological oriented.
0	Be A Doormat For A Man's Ego: The entire book was about stroking a man's ego at the expense of anything the woman may want.You have to submitt yourself towalking on eggs in order to keep his ego full of pride.Isn'tpride a sin? This book is not helpful,the book will cause thewoman to second guess herself.
1	So interesting!: This has been a very interesting read. I purchased it because I just started dating again after 27 years of marriage and the death of my hubby. I have 3 boys and lots of men in my life and never knew some of the things I learned here! I suggest this for all women.
1	fun: nothing but fun freddys one libners genious his kills bizzre gross and inhuman the actings great aspecialy by alice freddy and her frien yolonda.
0	And they continued the series because why?: Nightmare on Elm Street, A: The Dream Child (1989) Robert England, Lisa Wilcox, Erika Anderson, Valorie Armstrong, Michael Ashton, Kelly Jo Minter, Whitby Hertford, Danny Hassel, Beatrice Boepple, D: Stephen Hopkins.In the fifth installment, the nightmarish dream-stalker Freddy enters the dreams of survivor Wilcox's unborn child, attempting to place the souls of those he killed into the fetus, and enjoys his favorite pastime by going after her friends. Again, bizarre effects are the only pro here, but the movie's a bust. They saved the worst for last, but it's followed by FREDDY'S DEAD: THE FINAL NIGHTMARE.Running Time: 89 minutes and rated R for language and gore/violence.
0	Nightmare on Elm Street 5: The Dream Child: The second to worst film in the series. Not that good. Kind of boring with hardly any death scenes or comedy. Starring: Robert Englund, Lisa Wilcox, Danny Hassel, Erika Anderson and Kelly Jo Minter.
0	The new Vhs and Dvd version is terrible: This version of Nightmare on Elm Street is so terrible.Where's the special features at either on this new Vhs or Dvd there's no deleted scenes like the uncut vhs version.Dan's motorcycle scene was more graphic his face was ripped off and a needle stabs his abck,and Greta's death was longer Freddy cuts her stomach and feeds her own livers.There should be a new Vhs or Dvd version of the uncut version.
0	A sore dissapointment: Freddy [Robert Englund] returns to haunt alice [Lisa Wilcox] and her friends once more. But this time, Alice is pregnant with a boy and Freddy is using her unborn son to haunt her. As this is all going on, Freddy continues his rampage on those around her and it's again up to Alice to find a way to stop Freddy. This is one of the worst movies in the series [Behind only Nightmare 2], Mainly because of the weak storyline. There is, However, A rather insightful subplot which involves Freddy's mother, Amanda Krueger. The film's gothic tone could've been very beneficial to this film [If it only went with a better story!]. The acting is bad and the movie seems as if it has no genuine thrills to offer and therefore, It runs out of steam very quickly. If you want a good Freddy movie, Look elsewhere! Followed by Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare.
0	who could expect anything from this mess?: this, like the entire nightmare on elm street is another dull, silly and boring excuse for a movie. No one should expect anything but boredom from this.
1	good read about write: There are many good photographs and tasty tidbits in this fascinating glance at the writing inspirations behind our favorite songs. A little of it must necessarily be speculation, but it is thoroughly researched. One question: where did he get the drawing that inspired "Lucy In The Sky..," and is it authentic? He doesn't give a source.
1	Love this film--and the blu-ray looks spectacular.: One of my top ten favorite films, Polanski and the spot-on cast made one for the ages with this one...and I was really knocked out at how good the new HD version looked. Really wonderful to see a film of this age look like it was shot yesterday...Now I just want "The Last Picture Show" to get the same treatment, and I'll be happy :)
1	As Close to Perfect Film Noir as one can get: Early Jack Nicholson is edgy and powerful, and Faye Dunaway is an absolutely superb emotional wreck, in this examination of evil, and the limits to our ability to combat it. The surprise climax is very, very powerful.
0	Fine performances, but...: Watchable for the performances, but wildly overrated, as is nearly every Polanski film. "LA Confidential" probably could not exist if "Chinatown" hadn't, but the truth is "Confidentail" is everything this film isn't. Now if we could have just time-morphed Nicholson and Dunaway into "Confidential..."
1	Great job again Anchor Bay!!! This 4-DVD Gallagher Set rules!!!: Great job Anchor Bay Entertainment!!! This great 4 DVD set includes14 great Gallagher shows,very funny stuff indeed,Gallagher is a very unique and one of a kind comedian!!! So if you love Gallagher,this set is quite a bargain,the animated slipcover is also very cool,when you open it up a cardboard Gallagher smashes a cardboard watermelon,sort of like a kids pop up book!!! It's Sledge-O-Matic!!! Two thumbs up!!! Five stars!!! A+
1	tops: We have had a cake pan like this for over 38 years and everytime we use it my husband always said he wanted another. So, when I found this I COULDN'T WAITE TO ORDER IT. It's great for holding bar-b-que meat in as will as baking. And with the metal lid you can stack other dishes on top in the frig.
1	great: I had been looking for a cake pan with a metal lid for awhile to replace my old one... this is so great I ended up buying 3 and giving them away....you won't go wrong buying this..
1	Exactly that "An American Coup": Really gives good insight on what really happened as opposed to what we were told on that fateful day. You may believe all, some, or maybe none at all but it gives you a lot to think about. Fascinating.
0	Add us to the negative list.: When we rented it, we believed the people who had given 5 stars. After viewing,1 star is stretching it. I won't repeat, just read the1 star reviews and believe.
0	stupid people who only listen to those that agree: These Idiots wouldn't know a conspiracy if it were to kill them personally. The only thing this movie shows is how easily led some people are. If it were possible to give0 stars, I would.
0	Loose brains: Watch the documentary that was aired on the National Geo or Discovery channel of experts looking into the claims made in this video and they explain it all and conclude that the planes brought it down. But you arm-chair experts know more, bull crap.The floors of the towers were made of concrete, which were VERY heavy, just a few weakened steal beams as seen on the news is all it would take. The weight of the upper floors on those beams caused the upper floors to come crashing down upon the floor that was hit and caused a domino effect of ever increasing weight that just smashed the towers.Use some brains people.
1	Better than I thought: I watched this a couple of days ago. It was funny, and a bit on the "creppy" side, but it was great. I'm glad I took the advise and watched it. Existential crisis at its best!
0	Even the lead actress couldn't figure out this movie: Unique beauty Emmanuelle Devos led me here (seeRead My Lipsto understand why), but 'La Moustache' is a hard movie to like despite another winning performance by this beguiling actress. While suspenseful, the movie is ultimately infuriating because like another recent French release,Cache (Hidden), not only is the viewer unable to figure it out, turns out the actors are unclear on the concept as well. Indeed, in the "Making Of" featurette included on the DVD, Ms. Devos literally shrugs her shoulders and admits to giving up on figuring out the movie and simply focusing on her role. Moreover, director Emmanuel Carrère and writer Jérme Beaujour tell featurette viewers that they reviewed the first cut of the film and realized that they needed to chop out the explanatory scene (hopefully the one that lets on whether it's the wife or the husband that's gone off the deep end). Maddening.
0	An exercise in futility.: This film is like two films in one. The first half of the movie (in France) is wonderfully taut and suspenseful. We wonder about the motives of the characters. The second half (in Macau) is filmed like an amateurish indy film. The ending is a frustrating exercise in disappointment and need to be explained away only by watching the interview with the director (on the DVD). I borrowed the book to compare the endings and think the book ties up the loose ends better. All in all a rather frustrating and meaningless movie after the suspense in the beginning.
1	Another good Ahern story: I have liked Aherns characters every since his survivor series. The series also has some good characters and action. Kind of a fun read.
1	Freaks: Even people jaded by the extreme "realism" of the 21st century will be shocked by this one. I don't think any mainstream film maker today would have the guts to film this without some sort of political or socially correct manipulation. The story itself is rather pedestrian - opportunistic beauty takes advantage of besotted midget, and runs afoul of his friends. The action takes place in an old time circus, complete with the freaks that are no longer de riguer. The shocker is that few special effects are used, and the freaks are played by themselves. The result is a film with less of the 30s Hollywood melodrama, and a more realistic portrait of people who are physically different - some tragically disfigured. I found the experience moving and harrowing at the same time.
0	Good music: It was a great DVD. But I did realize it was a DVD. I wanted a CD. It would have been nice if it came with both
0	Damaged goods... Pay attention to vendor name.: The item was damaged, and previously a returned item. Half of the wire top was not attached.Guessing from the vendor name and the fact that this was a previously opened item, I believe it was a defective item. The vendor is less than scrupleous to send defective items... fool me once... never again!
1	Excellent guidebook for visitors to the Old City: If you have the time needed to follow the guidance in this book, you will find it to be a most worthwhile purchase. Although several years old, it's still new enough to lead the way through the various revelations that one can find in the Old City of Jerusalem.
1	The Consummate Traveller: Just when I think I've written a great travel story, I go read Palin and remind myself how it's done. I just love his incredibly obtuse descriptions and attention to unimportant detail. To read this, or any of his books, is to travel side-by-side with Palin as if a companion. I raise my glass to you.
1	Must see for fans of traveling shows: Michael Palin provides an offbeat and interesting documentary of his trip from the North Pole to the South Pole. This video makes you wish you could have gone with him!
1	sucked in.: I found this book to be one of the best in the Anita Blake series. For me, it started off a bit slow but quickly sucked me in. I don't want to give up any details, but the wonderful detail of the 'fight' scenes, the tension between Anita and Jean-Claude, and everything in between makes this out to be a very good read.
1	Circus of the Damned: If you loved Ann Rice you will love laurell Hamilton. Read thenm in order, this one is #3.
0	The Decline of Our Gang: Do not confuse the 52 Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer shorts with the classic comedies produced by Hal Roach Studios. When Roach sold Our Gang to MGM in1938, the creative spark quickly diminished until the series became unwatchable. Apart from the initial1938-39 shorts (highlighted by "The Little Ranger," "Aladdin's Lantern," "Men in Fright" and "Alfalfa's Aunt"), these one-reel travesties lack the charm and spontaneity of the Roach efforts. Spanky, Buckwheat and the gang were badly served by MGM's joyless, heavy-handed approach. On the plus side, the DVD set features excellent and uncut 35mm prints - which cannot be said for the sloppy RHI/Genius "Little Rascals" collection.
0	Our Gang + MGM = Bad Comedy: I'm amazed at the reviewers who have given this Our Gang DVD collection five stars. We're talking Spanky and Company at their worst! The first half-dozen shorts from1938 are OK, then MGM trashes the series beyond recognition. Though Hal Roach stopped producing comedy shorts for economic reasons, it must have pained him to see what Leo the Lion did to his beloved property. If you are truly an Our Gang completist, then consider Roach's "Hide and Shriek" the grand finale.
1	One hell of a businessman: Schwensen's business-like nature is sometimes annoying. He name-drops a lot and fawns over the genius of Carrot Top, offering as evidence of his creativity the fact that he makes money. But if you can supply the artistry, Schwensen definately knows the business. He has a lot of direct, useful information about how to market your act at all levels of competition, from novices to headliners.
0	This is what killed my ear for music.: Not trying to piss anyone off, this is my personal opinion after years of torture with this music. I HATE THIS CD AND STILL HOLD A GRUDGE AGAINST MY MOM FOR MAKING ME LISTEN TO THIS GARBAGE! Its not that I hate folk music, I love folk music (I love all music) and lovely people like Judy Collins and even early stuff by the seegers but half of these songs are off key and its twangy and horrible training for any young ear. Let your kids listen to real music please and not stupid kiddy versions that if they have any intelligence they will know are beneath them. You aren't doing your children any favors by buying them this crap. I'm sure there's some redeeming value because some people like this but I just cannot see it.
1	I love this: I love this. My children have all loved it. It's just great, authentic folk music, easy to listen to, easy to sing, easy to apply to whatever you might be doing. The way folk music ought to be.
1	Good Book for Experienced Test Takers: Buy this book if you already have substantial experience with NT4 and Windows 2000 and you need help passing the MS tests. I passed the monster 70-240 with this book. The "On the Exam" tips were especially helpful. Also, the "In the Real World" comments were very entertaining.
1	Antidote for a bad mood: Natalie MacMaster's music will lift your spirits any time, but don't miss a chance to see her perform onstage. She is a terrific entertainer as well as a masterful musician.
0	"The Reaping" should have been called "The Sleeping"...: because that was what I was doing after a few minutes of watching this Cardinal Sin being called a movie.If at confession you're given penance by your priest to do a thousand "Our Fathers" or to say the Rosary a hundred times, then count your blessings that he didn't force you to watch this movie just one time. Perhaps there truly is a place called Hell, because I felt like I was there for an hour and a half.This movie could have been so great, given the genesis of the story and staring Hilary Swank, one of the best actresses of our day, but it ended up being a complete mess. Even the quality of the blu-ray transfer was terrible.Please save your $19, or go buy "Seven" (which deals with this genera brilliantly), "28 Days Later", "28 Weeks Later", or "The Skeleton Key", which are all far superior films that you will enjoy time and time again.Happy movie watching :)
0	Of Interest to Preteen Girls: Oh, how Jane Eyre was such a boring read! But, of course, I've never been a little girl, the target audience for this story. It reads like a diary, without the "Dear diary, ..." part a nd covers Jane's life - as imagined by young Charlotte. I only read it for a literature class.
1	Excellent rendition: Amanda Root does an excellent job of bringing the story to life. She seems to truly understand the message Charlotte Bronte communicates in her superb dialogue. This is my favorite audio CD. Amanda Root's telling of the story does not sound like someone reading from a book, but rather like someone living a life. I highly recommend this audio book.
0	What a piece of crap: The only thing less exciting than this book would be watching paint dry.Stuffy english characters abound in this failed attempt to be Dickens-esque.
1	The best book I have ever read!: I am only12 years old but at least read a book a week. When i first picked up this book i felt i would not beable to finish it because of my ablity to get bored really quick. I started reading it and couldn't put it down. I got in trouble in 2 classes because i had been reading it under my desk until i reached a point (which was very rare) that i could put it down. I love Jane Eyre's way of thinking and how she trys to make her life as full as possible. I would recomend this to everyone! I keep on going back in the book to a part i liked best or a place in the story that captivates me. It seems i will never grow tired of this book. I hope all that have read it feel the same!
1	My All-Time Favorite Book: Jane Eyre is a wonderful masterpiece! I absolutely love it. The characters are so well drawn that you become one with Jane and everything she feels and endures. Mr. Rochester has to be the greatest male figure in literature! Move over Heathcliff! I got goosebumps by the end of the book and wanted to immedietly flip it over and begin again.
1	The best book I'll ever read!: This book is a wonderful story. It is a real page-turner. I couldn't put it down. Charlotte Bronte does awesome discriptions. I recomend this book to everyone who likes most classics. I wish people still wrote books this good. I guess you could call this book a trying-to-find-your-place-in-the-world story. Jane is totally amazing! Even if I am only11, I can understand what Ms. Bronte is talking about.
1	You'll either love it or hate it,: I was given this boom to read over the summer for school. I saw how thick it was and I thought oh-mi-god!! I read the first 2 chapters and could not get into it. But by the time I reached chapter 5 I couldn't put it down.It's one of those books you'll either love or hate.
1	Jane Eyre: This book is a wonderful book, but it drags quite a lot. Half of the book is Jane rambling on about Mr. Rochester. This book is very religious (this i don't mind) and Jane rambles on about this later on in the book. Nonetheless, the book was great. It had a many twists and turns. Yet it ticked me off that it all fell into place all of a sudden, for it dragged the conflicts. The book brings up Jane from a young girl of 8 to a woman of19. This book would bring tears to your eyes. Don't get deceived by the first150 pages. It is not all dull dull dull. The plot builds up like a snail crawling on grass but then at the top it falls like a roller-coaster. I do praise Charlotte for this work of art. It is as sweet as can be though I am not for romances.
1	A "Regular People" Review: OK, I'm no smarter than you are, and I read Jane Eyre and thought it was great. The book has so many themes to it, its not just about love, or money, or whatever- a lot of things are touched on. The main character is someone you'll never forget, just as I write this I'm mentally going over the book and I have that warm feeling in my stomach, thats how I know its a great book, so read it..... and keep me updated!
1	Jane Arrogant: Jane Eyre, a woman with courage, with passion, with determination, demonstrates a remarkable amount of pride while she lives her life. Her mixed life mingles between feeling sorry for her orphaned self and trying to be a romantic wife to Mr. Rochester. The novel, Jane Eyre, is an excellent work of Charlotte Bront not only because of the work itself, but because it is a relation to herself as an autobiography. Charlotte Bront was not that much different than the main character, Jane Eyre, in that they both lived without parents and they both know what loss can be like. The book flows eloquently from start to finish and contains many life morals concerning pride, love, and what it takes to live in this world. Jane Eyre shows how one can mature in to the person that they will be for the rest of their life. Because of this book, my life has been enlightened with good morals and I would recommend this book to anyone and everyone.
1	Wonderful!: The introduction includes a dedication and thanks to William Makepeace Thackery, author of Vanity Fair. Bronte and Thackery both admired the enormous capability of women even if not recognized by nineteenth century society. Jane Eyre, and Becky Sharp of Vanity Fair, are both strong women but in different ways. Jane is selfless, innocent, filled with love and yet heroic. Becky uses people. And she outwits nearly everyone. While they are different types of people, both are strong women who take the initiative.Jane Eyre exposes the narrow mind of the dogmatic evangelical. He wishes to serve God. However he doesn't care much for people. On the other hand, Jane in her own loving and simple way, seems to be a much better person. She reminds me of Dorthea of Middlemarch.This wonderful book should be read by one and all!
1	Beautiful classic!: I just finished reading this for the first time. I'm so happy I did. It's a great read, albeit a long read but worth the time spent.
0	Jane Eyre review: It was boring and filled with doodoo and i didnt like it at all and it sucks and i hate jane
0	cheap paperback: Classic novel, great price but the print is from the top to bottom of page and very unappealing to read!
1	My favorite book!: I am14 and I love this book!!!! I have read it 2 times and could read it again. This book is my favorite book ever, it held my attention all the way through(unlike the Jane Austin books which I like, but take a while to get instering). This is definalty the best romance I have ever read! Let me finish by saying I read it once as soon as i finished I was like man I should read it again, not much latter I was going for a long car ride so I did, and as soon as I finished it I thought the same thing, and I would have but my grandma wanted to read it(and this is such a great book that I had to let her read it beacuse everyone at least once should read it). One more thing I cried reading this book(add this to my list of books that make me cry: Marley and Me, The Return of the King, and now Jane Eyre).
0	The most BORING book in the world!: I am writing this because I just had to read the book as a requirement for English. It is the worst book in the world, and it drags on and on and on. I definitely would not recommend this book for anyone who likes action, mystery, or high paced books. If you want to be bored out of your mind, sure, go ahead and read it. Don't say I didn't warn you! If you ask me, sparknotes are the best thing for this book.
1	Jane Eyre: Enjoyable read! Did not read this while growing up, I thoroughly enjoyed the writing as well as the story. Refreshing!
1	Jane Eyre Still on Top: I loved Jane Eyre in high school and I still do now.The heaviness of the Victoria description, while way too heavy for me in books such as The Scarlett Letter, were much more comprehensible and approachable in Jane Eyre. I loved the character development in the book. And the story line of course, from rags to riches, had you rooting for Jane all the way. Adversity turns aside and she lives out her life in happiness and love. A wonderful story!
1	It made me love to read!: I've never been a reader but I joined a book club and this was the book of the month. I was very sure that I would never be able to read one of the classics and that I would be bored to tears. To my delight and surprise, this novel far surpassed any expectations I ever had. I was hooked from the beginning and looked for any opportunity to get away to read the book. It is not a fast read as the language was a big difficult at times but I learned to overlook the things that weren't so important to me and get on with the story. I have read two more classics since this novel and although Jane Eyre was my favorite, I am now a full fledged reading junkie.
1	A Bront Sister's Masterpiece: When I was looking through the books at the High School Library, the librarian, Ms. Pimentel, asked me if I was looking for anything in particular. I replied that I was not and she said to me, "Every girl from the age of nine and up should read Jane Eyre." I asked her to show me where the book was. It looked terribly boring but I wasn't about to say, "I'm not interested." So I took it. That night, I read through half of it. I couldn't help it--I was not able to put it down! What would happen to Jane next? Questions would race through my head and so I wouldanswer them myself by continuing to read. I finished it the next night. Ms. Pimentel was right. Every girl SHOULD read Jane Eyre.
0	Slow moving, feminist book.: I thought this was one of the slowest moving books I have ever read. Mainly focused on "romance" and unappearant drama. The ending to this book is also very predictable, I won't say it here because that will give it away. If this book had an unknown date and author I'd of thought it was another one of those trashy "love" novels written by Danielle Steel. Pure crap. The only reason I can find that this novel my even be remotely considered a classic is because it was written by a woman and it is Victorian.
1	Jane Eyre: I was missing out by skipping the end.: I tried to read Jane Erye in college, but I didn't budget my time well and didn't get to the end of the book before I had to take the test over it. Needless to say, I never finished it. Then a few years ago I read Jasper Fforde's hilarious book, The Eyre Affair, which uses Jane Eyre as a backdrop, and I decided to pick up the book again.When I began reading, I got frustrated with the excessive description and the unlikable characters at the beginning of the book. But I pushed through, and by the time I was half finished, I couldn't put the book down. On the surface Jane Eyre is a compelling love story, but underneath it is a heavy handed take on the scripture "if your right hand causes you to sin, then cut it off. And if your eye causes you to sin, then gouge it out." Despite the excessive description of trees and sunsets, Jane Eyre gives readers much to think about.
1	A job well done: This book is one of or the best that I have read in a long time. The writer of the book did an excellent job creating and evoking a variety of feelings within me. I am glad I read this book and I hope you will be too.
1	Good, solid copy: Jane Eyre is my very favorite book, and this is the copy I'll pass down to my grandchildren. It's aesthetically pleasing, and I'm sure it will hold together for many years. No arguing over the price, either. Thank you, B&N!
1	A Great Edition of a Classic Novel: If you are a Jane Eyre fan, junkie, or a first time reader, this is a wonderful edition to pick up. Dame Darcy brings the Gothic elements to life in her illustrations with an artistic flourish. I love these illustrations! They both complement the novel and are great on their own. This book was great to have on hand in class discussion on Jane Eyre and gothic literature.The text of this copy is the second edition of Jane Eyre with it's great preface by Bronte. It is a wonderful novel.
0	Too small: I did not realize the "collector's library" edition of this book would be so small - almost too small to read.
0	Vintage Classics Edition--proceed with caution.: I just received this Vintage Classics edition of Jane Eyre, chosen for the striking red cover, only to discover that 50 pages are missing (251-298). There is nothing more frustrating than being caught up in a wonderful book and having to come to a screeching halt because of a manufacturer's error, especially since this was my first time reading Jane Eyre.
0	True love is blind *well, it is for Jane, anyway*: Bronte shows through Jane that sex is Not one of woman'snecessities. Rochester is ugly, but he has a mind. I wish all womenwere of this opinion.
0	The book never came: The book never came, after some email exchange with the seller, no conclusion, I filed a claim with Amazon and got the money back.
1	Nice classical read: This is another good classic I had to read for Literature by Women in college. Following Jane's life is sad, yet interesting. It takes some good twists and turns. Recommend reading it!
0	Bootleg Version: I'm sure Raintree County is a grand film, that's why I wanted to watch it. Unfortunately I was unable to watch the film due to bad quality of the picture. I think I know what happened there. All the original prints must have been lost because this picture looks like someone has had put a little cheap camera in front of a TV screen and recorded it from the VHS version of it. Even worse, the camera wasn't focused properly and the white balance must have been way off. On the other hand the picture on the cover of the DVD is blurred, so I guess no one can accuse the producers of unscrupulousness and dishonesty! Problem is I bought this online so I had no idea.
1	Incredible energy: I don't know how Jimmy Sturr does it. CD after CD, the energy level is amazing. He always includes a cajun number or two, in this case Cajun Fiddle, and a country track, this time Big Ball's in Cowtown. He's so prolific that, on track12, he tells he Can't Afford to Be a Star. I hope that's not true, Jimmy.
0	Nice try, but...: This book is a sincere attempt to deal with the incredible mess of LINUX networking. It's better than nothing. It has a lot of useful information. It also has a lot of typos and misstatements and turgid descents into pure confusion. It needs summary sections covering "all the things required to..." and a serious troubleshooting guide.
1	My son loves it: Great toy for my 9 month old. I couldn't even get it wrapped for Christmas! My son chews on it because he is teething, defiantly not meant to be chewed on but I still love it :]
1	Absoutely Wonderful: Recieve the Body Back Buddy last week. Have suffered with pain in shoulders for years. Always had to find somebody to work my pressure points. Not any more. My new best friend the Back Buddy can do all and more that was advertised. Some of the best money I ever spent.
1	Great for spot massage: The Body Back Buddy is great. This is the only device I have found that allows me to pinpoint a tight spot in my back to work it loose. This is perfect for use in between massages. It is much better than using the door jamb. I can easily massage my feet also while watching TV.
1	Awesome deep tissue pressure!: I get so tight in my neck and back, and it's hard to massage that away by myself. This thing looks funny, but man, it packs a punch. The pressure points are small, so be careful if you're not into deep tissue. There are pointed spots and more rounded spots, so if you like it on the lighter side, use one of the rounder spots. I use both. I tied a satin sheath over one of the protruding "branches" and that works great for sliding the thing around (over a shirt/blouse), without "sticking" when it comes to the plastic/skin contact. I can get rid of the tension in my neck and back very well with this thing. It sometimes hurts the day afterward, and I don't care. I just use it again, and the muscles are loose again.If you like it gentle, be careful with this. If you're like me, and aren't that delicate, then get this thing. It's well worth the $20.
1	Covers it all: Great item. Covers all the pressure points without paying for a therapist at $85 for 30 minutes. Great remedy for what aches you.
1	Body back buddy: This product delivers what it claims. I find it very useful and extremely effective at leveraging hard to reach places on my body and massaging deeply areas regardless of location. I would recommend this product to anyone who has muscle pain/ tightness and can't afford / doesn't want to visit a private masseuse. Considering what you get this is a great value!
1	Helpful product: I use this to message trigger points in my upper & mid back, as well as my upper traps and neck. It's very helpful in reaching otherwise difficult spots. My problems are quite chronic so this hasn't fully alleviated my trigger points but with more use I'm sure it will. I've found this works well with the "The Trigger Point Therapy Workbook" which you can buy here on Amazon.
1	Small but nice: It's pretty well done, nothing to say about that. It's really tiny though, and won't hold anything bigger than small letters.
0	not the same in the picture: when i was searching for one of these it was for my mom for a christmas gift this year. That was all she asked for. When I saw this one I liked it. it looked nice, big enough to hold letter without them hanging over and it also looked like it could hold them sideways.But when she got it and opened it up. It was totally different. Not at all what the picture looked like. I was very disappointed. Of course she hung it up. i dont understand if your going to advertise a product and someone buys it atleast send the one that is advertised.Other than the size it is nice work. I love the light color of the wood.
0	Too Small!: This product is way to small to hold any mail.... if you are looking for something to hold your mail in do some research first this only holds up to an index card size envelope!
0	NOT RECOMMAND...: TOTALLY DIFFERENT DESCRIPTION, TERRIBLE ASSEMBLING... VERY SMALL...NOT RECOMMAND... IF YOU WANT TO BUY ENVELOPE CASE OR SOMETHING... TRY OTHER PRODUCT....
1	Gift for teacher: I gave this to my favorite math teacher and she loves it. The projects make math concepts easier to understand.
1	Highly underrated: Great little movie. I'm surprised it didn't get better reviews. Kids and adults liked it. Check it out, good addition to your movie library.
1	Another Bette Davis Classic that does well: This is a pretty good performance by Bette Davis, Karl Malden in a movie that features a "poor twin" and a "rich twin". The "poor twin" kills the "rich twin" and takes over her life.Pretty similar to another movie called "Stolen Life" that explores the same theme, except she takes over the twins life after an accident, not after killing her.Although not one of her best, it is still a good watch and a good performance by both actors.
1	Very Good: I enjoyed this old movie. It is one of Bette in her later years but she still had it.The storyline was a twist too..
1	BRAIN DONORS?! MORE LIKE LAUGH LOANERS!: This movie is just too good for words. It gives you as many laughs as the red green show. The slapstick shenanighans keep comming as the laughs keep rolling. I once laughed so hard i fell asleep and woke up and turned the movie off. One liners, Obesity, Gags, Puns, ensue. Go and rent this now along with once bitten.
1	An amazing book, one of the best I ever read: A sparkling defense of the one thing most people seem to think indefensible, Christian orthodox thought (You know, old school). This book is a positive, intelligent, funny defense of the faith. One of the best I've ever read.
0	Horrible Formatting: This book has THE WORST formatting I've ever seen. It looks like it was hastily put together using Microsoft Word. Very amateurish. The cover doesn't even have the title on the spine, so I can't recognize it on my bookshelf.The version from BiblioBazaar:Orthodoxyis MUCH MUCH better, well worth the extra dollar or two.
1	A REALLY GOOD GAS GUN.: GUN IS VERY GOOD. LOOKS REAL, EXCEPT FOR THE ORANGE TIP. HEAVY, BUT NOT TOO HEAVY. SHOOTS WELL. CAN USE TRIGGER, SLIDE OR JUST POINT AND SHOOT. MAGAZINE HAS A BUTTON TO REMOVE BB'S LIKE A REAL GUN. I HAVE ONE PROBLEM THOUGH, ADDING GAS IS A PROBLEM. IT ALWAYS LEAKS, EVERY TIME. I HAVE A GAS REVOLVER, THAT NEVER LEAKS. I END UP GETTING BURNED, IF I'M NOT CAREFUL. I'M SURE IT HAPPENS WITH OTHER GAS GUNS. REVOLVERS DON'T SEEM TO HAVE THIS GAS LEAK PROBLEM. I GIVE IT A 4, CAUSE OF THE GAS LEAKAGE. THANK YOU
1	If you love Cajun or if you love rock 'n' roll: you'll love this great CD. The Bluerunners, yeah! Get 'em all!
0	not very useful: It kiind of works but I would rather use a magnifine glass. I have to tilt it to get light in and see what I am doing.
0	Marginally Acceptable: I would probably have returned this "loupe" (actually a cheap magnifying glass)if shipping hadn't exceeded what I paid for it. I have a true loupe, a 4x Schneider that cost me $80 on eBay. I thought that, for $6, a10x loupe would be handy for focusing my medium and large format cameras. It didn't work out that way.Only the very center area is in focus, more or less. One's eye has to be back about 5-6 in. from the "loupe". This all means that you only see a very tiny area, which makes using it a real pain. Comparing what I see with this thing at10x and what I can see with my Schneider at 4x, I wonder if it's really10x.I''m not a happy customer. This is the first crummy thing I've gotten from Adorama, having been a steady customer of theirs for several years. I'm disappointed and saddened.
1	Nice loupe, good price.: I bought this to replace an 8X Agfaloupe I used to have for slides and negatives. Both are good. At this power some of the negatives edges are cut off, but it's easier to see facial expressions. If you need near full frame go with 8X, more detail10X or even15X.
1	Good Clear Quality Loupe for price: Good Clear Quality Loupe for price. Construction could be better, but its a great value for the price.
1	Healing from diarrhea and Ulcerative Colitis: I have struggled with diarrhea from Ulcerative Colitis for the past year or so. I have tried many alternative therapies and as a last ditch effort to stay off of prednisone tried what this book recommends.I have been completely amazed at the results. I went from diarrhea all the time to better than I have been in many many many many years (I'm 43 now). I highly recommend this book and I thank God that He led me to it and made me desperate to try what this book recommends as it has been a major lifestyle change in what I eat.
1	Restoring Your Degestive Health: Love this book and Love Dr. Brasco -- just recently acquired him as a physician was so awesome to have a physician PERSONALLY call you when you're having issues instead of office help -- doesn't happen much anymore -- I learned alot from talking to him personally and from this book.
1	A Whimper not a Bang: I give this book 4 stars for taking on the topic but agree with other reviewers who find it disappointing ... perhaps because one gets one's hopes up to read a title like this, "the story of the King James Bible". McGrath has done some thorough research (it is his profession) and introduces some interesting data from the past but he is unable to weave his story together in a way that conveys with power, passion and enthusiasm what was one of the most stunning events in Anglo/American history. I think this book suffers in great part from lack of good editorship. I give it 4 stars for subject matter and being a unique attempt to explore and present in laymen's terms information about this spectacular creation, second only to Shakespeare for those of us who love the English language! -- but I give it a 2-1/2 for the rest.
1	In the Beginning: The Story of the King James Bible and How: Very well written, extremely informative and interesting. I learned alot more of how the Bible came about and how different Bibles developed. Interesting not only to the Christian community but also to history people. Fascinating read.
1	Thorough, complete, and quite witty as well: Alister McGrath has a gift for clarity of expression and unbiased treatment of the theological thought and history of any era of which he writes. In the Beginning, unlike his more scholarly works, makes the periods surrounding that of the King James Bible very accessible, even to those who have little knowledge of the time. His highly readable, often hilarious, style provides a very easily understood, very comprehensive treatment of both the theology and politics of the High Middle Ages and Reformation times.
1	worth the read: I am taking a class on Harlem renaissance literature and this was the first book assigned. It is easy to read and an enlightening story, the background information provided was interesting as well.
0	Gets there: It was an interesting read. At first it was tough to follow, but about halfway through you really get interested and the reader cannot put the novel down!!
1	GIRLS ARE MADE FOR LOVING: THE MOVIE IS A GREAT CULT CLASSIC FROM THE 70'S. A LITTLE SLOW AT TIMES BUT FUN.
0	Can a book be any duller?: Abby, the successful engineer returns back to her hometown after10 years where she meets Chase the former high school hottie. He has a big secret which we find out is the fact that he is illiterate... Their differences in education don't seem to matter, they still get together and plan to spend their future as a married couple, endless rambling on about it later I wish I had not wasted my time on this book.
1	Beautifully colored: I use the Universal deck in my professional work, but I love the coloring of this deck for personal use. It's strong and evocative, but in a quality way, not loud or garish.
1	MUSICA NORTENA #1: HOLA, UNAS POCA PALABRAS PARA DECIR QUE SI QUIEREN OIR MUSICA BUENA PUEDEN OIR A PESADO, IMAN, INTOCABLE, CONTROL, ALAZAN, RAMON AYALA, SICLON, PALOMO, INVASORES, CADETES DE LINARES,ESENCIA NORTENA, DULO NORTENO, Y MUCHOS MAS SIN OLVIDAR AL GRAN GRUPO LA FIRMA. TODAS SUS CANCIONES SON DEDICADAS A UANA PERSONA MUY ESPECIAL AL QUE QUIERO MUCHO. ARMANDO Y YAJAIRA POR/ VIDA
0	old-school text: Oi, how much more convoluted can a text get? With every edition, this text gets less organized. Or that is at least true for the last 3 editions, anyways ... Eg. In how many chapters can the topic of "symmetry" be covered? Keeping it to1 would be much easier to digest, thankyou.The text is written in old-school rambly style... sure, it covers all topics, but it is hard to learn from (and in my experience, even harder to teach from). There are better options out there. Nesse "Intro to Mineralogy" text.
0	returned my copy: I am surprised O'REILLY published such a weak book. To keep it short, it is one of those "click here, click there, you are done!" kind of books. I doesn't go much deeper than the Cocoa tutorials on Apple's developer site.
0	Good School Bag Not A Great Travel Bag.: I bought this bag for traveling. It is not very comfortable, the shoulder straps feel like they are filled with packing paper, and compared to similar priced bags the material is cheap. It looks great and has plenty of storage. I was replacing a 5 year old Targus Port Bag. Due to the edition of roller gear on the new port bags I decided to go with another bag. For my needs, I should have gone with a different company. Also to note is that the storage is great however, a fully packed bag will not fit in the over head bin of a smaller jet airliner.
0	Not worth the time....: I really was excited to start reading this book, thinking it would be full of smart, well-crafted essays that would truly make you think (you know, like Bill Hick's stand-up did). So, I was deeply disappointed to find this book just to be fill with uneducated rants that spent more time worrying about fitting a new Bush joke in, then about actually making a point. Great idea, horrible execution.
0	A bunch of whiny losers: Maybe this show appeals to some people, but to me the characters seem like a bunch of annoying, whiny retards. I can't stand the voices of the main actors - two of them shriek rather than talk. Rather than provide comedy that everybody can enjoy, Will & Grace revolves around cliches and gay sex jokes. Debra Messing is the only salvation in the show, but she's not enough to save bad comedy.
0	Bad re-imaging: There are several parts of the film when it just goes to a still photo and voice or backround music is heard. If I knew so much of the original film was missing I probably would not have bought it. I was disappointed in my purchase.DPrice
1	Best movie musical ever: An epic musical, flawlessly produced by Garland and Luft. A classic tale of stars treading on the (often perillous) arc of fame and popularity, has been beautifully told in song and story. Garland, Mason, Bickford and Noonan: superb actors -all. And that Judy Garland sang those great songs...They don't come better than this great movie musical, the most brilliant of all: a seamless marriage of song and story, with it's one true competitor being Garland's Wizard of Oz.
0	Wonderful Production but1937 Version Was BEST: Judy Garland's singing and dancing & George Cukor's directing saved this film from being a total flop. James Mason was horribly miscast as Norman Maine as were almost all the other characters. In defense of Mr. Mason who was an outstanding actor, noone could replace Fredric March as Norman Maine. This DVD has about 55 minutes of Premire Footage outside the Pantages Theater in1954 with interviews with attendees like Joan Crawford, Cesar Romero, George Jessel. This alone is worth the price of the DVD.
0	not enough: It looks like a microsfot brochure for the people who have no odea about Axapta. it is giving some basic knowledge for beginniners.
0	I did not understand the codes.: Book looked like hundreds of people had just read it. I haven't read it yet. Because to small print-worn etc.Of course Taylor Caldwell will not disappoint me.
0	I just can't get into it: I've had to force myself to read halfway through this book. The pilgrim chapters are the most interesting, but overall, it's just boring.
0	awful squeaking: yes this is cheap but that's for a reason. the slats are weak and my husband snapped one while assembling it. and worst of all, it is increadibly squeaky, and is getting worse.
1	just listen it: Scene from the second story: The god machine. All I know about this band, they from Montreal(Quebec) and they have a another album before scene from the second story. If you like post-rock music, you gonna really like this band, you just have to close your eyes and.....the energy of they music is unimaginable. I can't choose a song in particulary because they all make the album. If you like Mogwai, Slint, ...try to get a copy because unfortunately is discontinued...but I really don't know why!!!!!!
1	Good Ctrl, Promising Software (doesn't work always): Nice controller, comfortable, Plug n play. No problems, if the game detects the buttons, but had problem with quake 3, with the controller activated, the whole screen started going round and round (spinning). MDK 2 worked great though with analog controls. The analog controls work fine in Unreal tournament as well.The software is promising but could not get much out of it. The best use is to use it as plug and play and enjoy the games it supports.
1	Very confotable and configurable gamepad.: It's confortable, specially if you have big hands. I use it to play Fifa 2003 and X-Wing alliance. The software that maps the keys of the gamepad to those required by the game allows you to use it for any game.Actually I prefer it over a joystick for flight simulator games. It's a lot more confortable.
0	these are double dobby stripes: nowhere in the description does it say that these sheets are dobby striped. i was looking for solid white sheets. another disappointment!
1	Good general source: Although exploring nothing new about the Eastern Front and even making some mistakes in the introduction (for example about the Red Army Purges) this book is a very good source to have for the general account and movement of the German Army throughout1941 on the Eastern Front as well as the respective response from the Soviet side. Although more sources could and should have been used, I can understand why they were not, as the book would be too cumbersome and hard to follow. Detailed studies can be found in various other books of individual unit actions, but that is not what this book is for. If one has an interest in a certain action and/or day that an event occurred on, they can do their own research with this book being their beginning general account/source.
1	A source for some information: This work contains some interesting information, and can be used as a source in researching particular topics. But it , in my opinion, was never really comprehensive enough. And having had its most recent edition close to fifty years ago is not up-to- date.
0	Don't believe the Hype: I bought this movie after watching the previews on another movie. I am an action junkie; and this movie looked like tons of action. It was not. They must have shown all of the action scenes in the preview. This movie is VERY LONG, VERY SLOW, BORING, with a very disappointing ending. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME!!!
1	Glimpse into a hidden world: This collection of stories is more than simply a memoir of a childhood lived within a secluded harem. It is also a story of a process of change that took place decades ago as the country of Morocco was becoming an independent nation state.I was fascinated by the stories of the women who spent their lives hidden from the outside world within the family enclaves of the middle class in Morocco. I've purchased it for friends and colleagues who were interested in women's stories, both from a feminist perspective and from a humane one.The stories are told with sensitivity and compassion, as well as a deep respect for, and understanding of Islam.
1	Important read: Well written. Insightful. Entertaining. Informative. Important issues for our times. Interesting to compare Mernissi's childhood experiences with all that she has accomplished since.
1	Amazing: The content, research, and intellect that went into this very detailed book is nothing short of amazing. Very deep and extemely well written, you will find you cannot stop in the middle. If you want something to stimulate your thinking, challenge your ideas, and push you, READ THIS. It should be a textbook. OUTSTANDING...BUY IT, YOU WON'T BE SORRY...
0	Keep Looking!: This book was too ambitious. It covered too many topics, spanning from childhood to adulthood, without really getting to any helpful information. Don't waste your time or money on this one.
1	Safekeeping: I read this because I so enjoyed "A Three Dog Life," about a later period in the author's life after her husband suffered a traumatic brain injury. "Safekeeping" is not as engaging, but worth a look for those who enjoy memoirs and are interested in crafting their own.
1	_: This outstanding essay is included in Chomsky's book American Power and the New Mandarins. Great as it is, I would recommend spending a few dollars more to get American Power and the New Mandarins which contain this same text as well as chapters on "the responsibility of intellectuals," "the revolutionary pacifism of A.J. Muste," "on resistance," and much else.
0	Bridesheads Revisited: Interesting read, not really sure what I expected. Tended to be a bit ponderous. Still, it was a nice change from the usual modern story I often pick up
0	The SLOWEST read I've had in a long time! Boring!: I usually read a book in one or two nights after dinner. I've been on this book for over a week and have absolutely no problem putting it down. It is just a SLOW read; certainly doesn't have anything in it to hold my interest.I'm a person that refuses to give up (except for a few that I filed in a Mistakes folder) on my kindle. I think I'm up to 62% read now and will probably force myself to finish it but it will definitely get put into the mistakes folder.In other words --- it's just plain BORING!
0	Not JavaScript Objects: Not up to par with the normal writings of Wrox Press. This book talks a lot and gives ideas but fails to properly explain the code or the objects. Chapter 6 is an introduction and discussion on a database application but fails to be anything other than an expanded users guide for the app. More time could have been spent explaining how the object structure in the applications is being used. In my opinion the title miss leads you into something that the book really is not. It should be called "Ideas for what to do with JavaScript".
0	Waste of my Money: I have worked with javascript for some time and wanted to learn to create javascript objects and impliment them into my code. I thought that this would be the perfect book for my needs but I have never been so wrong. The book could be called "creating data structures using javascript" because it jumps right into complex examples of creating data structures with very little explanation of what is happing from a language prospective. I did get far enouph to write some BAD object code and post it out to a news group who got me on the right track. THIS IS NOT THE BOOK FOR YOU IF YOU ARE TRYING TO LEARN JAVASCRIPT OBJECTS FOR THE FIRST TIME. It is now in my trash basket.
0	Faulty Information?: Apparently the author has lived abroad too long. On page one he states: "A child born in the U.S., for example, is a U.S. citizen even if both of his parents are illegal immigrants." Not only is this untrue, a baby born to LEGAL immigrants isn't automatically granted citizenship. The rules changed long before the publishing of this book--the author should verify his facts. I can't help but wonder if the whole book isn't fully of erroneous information (I only read the first ten pages, which are available at the publishers site).
0	my child called this "the worst game ever": I will say the 3-d fx do work...for a hand-full of pictures, you have to lay out all the cards ( you will need a massive table or the kitchen floor) and search for random objects great concept poorly executed. as the title of the review stated. The10 year old said "this is the worst game ever" we played it once and it's collecting dust on the shelf.
0	bearing problems: Both the original and a replacement Keller dovetali bit quickly lost the lower seal on the bearing which will allow sawdust to build up in the bearing and will lead to premature failure.
1	Great and professional product: This is one of the best RC Ni-Starter out there. I did a lot of research before buying this product. It's with no double one of the most durable and professional.
1	Best bedding set out there!: The Safari set is the cutest set around and affordable!My mom purchased almost every item in the collection online.The ONLY downfall was that we couldn't find any items in a store near us and there are items we would like to get, like the lamp, and Target doesn't carry it anymore.With a10% discount, we payed under a dollar in shipping.We were even more satisfied when we viewed the items in person.I HIGHLY recommend this set for a baby girl or boy.
0	Rethink before you buy: It is in no way the bedding that I don't like. I absolutely love the bedding, however as far as Target making it accessable. that is an entirely different issue. If you plan on getting this as a set you better start checking E-Bay now, because that was the only way I could complete the set. Unfortunately I didn't buy EVERYTHING at once and by the time I went back to purchase the bumper and dust ruffle the manufacturer had discontinued the item.(It wasn't a significant amount of time either). In addition Target was VERY unwilling to help. To make a long story short- if it says arriving soon, rather than a ship date chances are you won't recieve that item, because it is no longer made. Again the bedding is adorable, but for the hassle you'll have to go through to decorate save youself the time and go elsewhere.
1	Love the Look and the Quality!: I've purchased or recieved almost all of the pieces to this set for my baby boy's nursery and I absolutely love them. This set has bright colors and a fun feel to it! With a different wall paint color, it could easily be for a girl as well. The quality is excellent as far as I can tell and is an improvement from the plain pastel colors that everyone else has to offer!
1	Look on EBAY: I bought the set as well and love it!! I went on ebay and saw a seller that had a lot of the accessories I wanted. I emailed her and asked her if she could get other items I needed. Now I have all pieces to the collection.
1	Very difficult to locate all items: I absolutely LOVE this set; however, it is terribly difficult to locate all of it! Only one store in my area even has it in stock, and they don't have everything. I bought the dust ruffle and it doesn't fit on our standard crib- it is an inch too short (not length of the ruffle to the floor, but end to end), I was very disappointed. I adore the &quot;wall hanging&quot; animals, but, not only are they unlisted online, but they are quite hard to find. Once Target sees the popularity of a pattern-they should make a better attempt to make it available; might I suggest a way to locate what local stores have it available to save a multitude of phone calls etc...
1	Perfect for newbies (like me)!: I'm new to c++ and decided to try to learn it through this book.It works magnificent in teaching me how C++ works, how to code in it and how to convert C code.It is writen in a very conversational way and it always have some code besides the explenation (I for one enjoy reading the code also when I'm reading the explenation of a new feature!).This book is realy good for teaching people the basics!I hope you will enjoy this book as much as I do (I ain't finished with it as I'm writing this review).
1	Suhrhold deck Brush: My latest purchase of the Shurhold brush head is a replacement for one that I have had for twenty five years. It is the only brush I will use on my car as it is soft enough not to scratch the paint. The old brush is reserved for cleaning the garage floor. It is still useable after 25 years.
1	Locke gave a thorough understanding for society.: I thought that this book did a good job of explaining the role of the society and of the government. It also sets up a State of Nature to justify the State. It tells the role of the individual, and the rights entitled to the individual upon entering the State. I enjoyed this book, and enjoy Locke's philosophy.
1	Optima Deep Cycle Yellow: Great Battery. I use lots of accessories and with a high output ALT this battery does the job. If you run AMPS etc this is the battery for you. Lots of reserve power for the Optima Yellow Category. I recommend it as your next Battery....
1	Detailed and informative, BUT.......: Robert Gordon's account of Muddy's life encompasses the entire spectrum of a great bluesman's struggles and successes from birth to his death in1983. The additional notes at the back of the book are great reading and I enjoyed the time I spent learning of Muddy Waters' life.However....there are two major mistakes in the picture subtitles. One identifies Ron Wood of the Rolling Stones as Mick Taylor. Mick had quit the band years before the1978 photo was taken. Another photo showing Muddy and Son Sims in1943 identifies the guitar that Muddy is holding as a National steel guitar, when it is obviously a wood bodied resonator, not a steel bodied guitar. If Mr. Gordon is this free and loose with his checking of the facts on the pictures, it leaves me in doubt as to the quality of his research on all the other data in the book.
1	funny BUT bad: It is FUNNY... VERY Funny!!!!! its just too bad he has to be so vulgar... beyond the very often F Bombs he drops..... he is a very funny man!
0	Just so you know...: Carlos is neither Mexican nor original. He doesn't want us to get offended by his empty racial jabs (which don't offend me), but I do take offense at his ripping off other, better comedians. It's not an easy thing to come up with material...well, good material anyway. Think of it like a song or a novel. If you wrote a terrific song, performed it at some club and then heard a crappier version of it, recorded by another band, on the radio wouldn't it bother you? Why is comedy any different? If you think it is, then by all means buy this hack's junk, but if you respect integrity don't support this jerk.
0	Hoff doesn't really understand human nature.: I don't know if it's a flaw in Taoism or in Hoff's logic, but he preaches the importance of appreciating things as they are and not struggling against them, while ignoring the fact that the nature of humanity is to change things. Humans struggle to become (or at least appear) other than what they are, and this involves changing the self and the things around oneself. Hoff foolishly ignores this and reduces humanity to the level of fish that are trying in vain to whistle.
1	The Irregulars: This movie is so pleasant and funny that any audience will love it. The resultant outcome is not conservative at all but does play to most everyone's joy.
0	Inconsistent performance: (+)Great price, high speed(-)HOWEVER before you buy this consider whether a cordless phone is used nearby. The DLINK card consistently drops connections when I use my 2.4 GHz phone even at 200 ft away. Yes, I should expect that due to the fact they use the same frequency but I NEVER experience interference with my 2Wire wireless card which was so much more reliant and is used at the same location. The DLINK card keeps dropping connections when the phone is used. It is incredibly frustrating and I am going to consider returning it.Third DLINK product I've bought, third satisfactory result from them. I've also used a total of 6 wireless cards and 3 wireless routers/access points. Although DLINK isn't at the bottom of the heap, it sure hasn't performed at the top. Checkout 2WIRE (hard to get retail) or Netgear's equipment.
0	absolute junk: I have had nothing but trouble with this product. no matter how many times i have dowload new, or older, drivers, the installation is never complete. their help desk neither has been able to provide with any help to this problem (though they have tried).i will not spend money on another dlink product.
1	a very good wireless card: This card has given me the ability to be crazy and sit outside with my laptop and do my work from there. For some reason I feel much more creative when I am outside in the open air rather than inside in the boring stale air.This card was installed in almost no time at all and it felt like it was almost too easy. But after the reboot I was able to find and see that the card was installed correctly and the quick time wasn't a bad thing, but a good thing.The wireless range seems pretty good. I use a DI-524 as my wireless router, but I also don't have a very big home. Either way I am satisfied and would think others would as well.
1	Fast and stable, if you don't protect access: It works fine with D-Link DI624 wireless router, if you don't set any kind of protection tool. I have got stable and strong connections at108 Mbps in any point of my house, even with many walls between DWL-G650 and DI-624.At this moment, I am connected for almost 6 hours, without crash and always at108 Mbps. It works fine with my Sony Vaio notebook and with Toshiba's. But its stability vanishes when I configure any tool for secure networking (WEP, WPA, WPA-PSK ...). So, it works fine, but is not secure.
1	A real winner: I am glad this was my first choice for a wireless adapter. I was told to go out and buy a wireless adapter and with help from the local store's employee he recommended me this card. He said D-Link was a good reputable company. I believed him and bought this card and brought it home. Besides if he wasn't right I could always return it right back to him. :)Either way I was able to get this working by following the intstructions and was connected to my work's wireless network in minutes. I thank the helpful employee who helped me and I thank D-Link. Thank you both.
1	works really well: I think most of my frustration is due to my ISP, but this thing has been great really. The best feature doesn't even come in the box, but the tech support is phenomenal. I spent a bit of time on hold, but the guy I spoke with had me up and running in no time at all.In general, the setup is easy (I'm using it with the D-Link DI-624). The program installs everything for you, I ran into trouble after my ISP shut down my service for some foolish reason and made me change some settings which I guess messed with my network setup. In any case, this comes highly recommended for anyone that wants to set up a wireless network, even if you aren't particularly computer savvy, as I am not.
0	Does not install properly on HP notebook running XP: Did not install properly. DLInk customer services was not one bit helpful. Drivers have not passed Microsoft's scrunity. I cannot recommend this at all.
0	Poor quality: Very poor recording. Sounds like it is muffled or filtered. Fortunetly most of these tracks are recorded correctly on the 2 CD set "The Magic Touch". Skip this and go to "The Magic Touch"
1	Works Great.: I do a little bit of gaming and have compared wireless to running a hard wire and don't find any difference in speed or signal strength. It works well throughout my house (two story 2500 square ft).
0	Piece of Junk: I chose D-Link because of their customer support 24/7 for the life of the product. I have gone through 2 DI-624. DSL and Cable Modem (Road Runner). It keeps DROPPING THE SIGNAL. From reading another review, its true that the firmware updates are what kills this router. Each update creates new problems. Everyone tells me to use Linksys and I am getting one now... PS I have used D-Link for over 3 yrs!
0	Don't Waste your time or money: This unit is terrible, its poorly made, cheap does not work well with Macintosh computers and the tech-support is terrible! The tech support - barely speaks english, is difficult to understand and the phone connections are awful - made me wonder why they even offer tech support. Trust me this is not a good product.
0	shipping: The router is good- ... 3btech is less than dismal on shippingI ordered with a 3day select ups ship and received over the 3 dayperiod - they had some lame story about not shipping until the1st full business day - .. which was two days AFTER I placed the order - they refused to do anything refund wise -I will never do business with them again-
0	piece of crap: d-link needs to get its act together. this router of airplus is a laugh. never seen so much problems from one equipment. lost connection, rebooting itself every half hour, losing signal, rebooting computer to get back signal. returned twice over a span of 3 weeks. fianlly returned back for good for another brand. a linksys speedbooster. now that works great!!tech support wasn't helpful either..spent more time on phone with tech than anybody else. still didn't get the problem solved. each one kept telling me to return the router back and get another one after there book runs out of troublehsooting ideas. tired of that...:( the tech needs help with updatng there knowledge of the equipment and manners. d-link needs to rebuild there router again.its not worth it......buy a linkys speedbooster or netgear instead.
1	3btech & Amazon: I ordered a DI-624 from Amazon by way of 3BTECH. They sent the wrong Router which was an upgrade a DI-624M. But I used the DI-624 on my system and there is a difference in the speed. 3BTECH told me they where the same but if you read the manual they are not. They would not take it back without me paying a shipping charge and restocking fee. Don't deal with 3BTECH because Amazon will not back them up and you don't get the same service like when you deal with Amazon. Stay away from this 3rd party company. You can only contact them by way of e-mail.
0	dlink sucks: i am so disappointed because tech support was unhelpful. they could not get my laptap wireless running they blamed on my laptap. i was using smc wireless perfectly except its speed up to 54mbps.
1	Great workhorse: I've been using this router for years and it has never given me problems. The setup is easy and the maintenance is non-existent. The signal is strong enough to get to my Xbox 360, which is downstairs and across the house.What's so amazing is that while my computer and its components get replaced every few years, this little workhorse has stayed with me through it all.Highly recommended.
0	Waste of money - no range: From the word go, this router has been painful. I have a1-room radius from this piece of junk. Sometimes, I one bar on my iphone with it sitting ontop of the router!Easy set up and everything, just doesn't work when set up!
0	Connection Problems - cannot use all features: I have had this router for over a year. It worked well for the most part. But every once in a while I got problems with connection, for which I had to call customer support.Now suddenly it has become a big pain ... Both wired and wireless connections drop every10 mins because router reboots itself. I have made over a dozen calls to tech support, but the problem has remained.The other thing is that D link tech support always tells you to go with basic 802.11b config with no encryption ( the most they would let me do was WEP, and always turned down WPA ). So even though this router has a lot of cool features ( super G, WPA, gaming mode etc. etc. ) , you are not allowed to use any of them. That is because if you try and it does not work, tech support will always tell you to turn all of them off. Thus all I have is a powerful router being used as basic 802.11b.
0	Didn't work for me...: I futzed with this for about a week. Had d-link tech support's number programmed into my phone (power down the router, press the reset key, replug everything, yada yada yada). I bought this router and the PCI wireless card for my desktop because of the excellent reviews I read on this item at CNET and PC Magazine. The PCI card froze my desktop EVERY time I turned the network on and the router would not connect to my laptop even when the units were a few feet apart. Exchanged for Linksys and have had not one call to tech support. I suppose this will work for a lot of people, but for me this operated as a1 star product. Do buy from a place you can easily return (like Amazon!) because if your experience is like mine, you will get fed up talking with the tech support people and try something else!
1	Over my head?: Frustrating at first because it took me a little while to learn how to use the D-Link Router. Once I learned what all of the terms meant, it was smooth sailing. Now I have a safe wireless computer, am able to work outside or at a neighbor's house! One more thing I must say, this is working on an OS X v.10.3.9. This wireless system almost felt like it was made for my little Mac. I did a lot of research to find the best wireless router for this computer and this is the only one I could find that claimed to "welcome Mac." computers.
0	Ripoff: I bought this product from Best Buy about a year and a half ago; my family got cable and a wired network just wasn't feasible with our layout, so we went with this D-Link device.Connection drops every few minutes, and sometimes it won't come back up until the router is rebooted...which requires unplugging the router and the modem, then putting them through their boot cycles one at a time. When it works its best we do this every other day, at its worst we do it daily; today it had to be rebooted three times in one hour.I've tried multiple connection devices, DWL122, DWL G650, DWL G520, and whatever one came built into my sister's Dell. Getting closer to the router hasn't helped; it still even dropped packets. (As an example, an instant message or two may simply never reach me.)Needless to say, my family's looking for something new since their tech support's suggestions were useless.
0	Buy another router-unstable connections: DI-624 router frequently disconnects itself from all computers, wired and wireless, attached to it. What's more, it will reboot and might take up to 5 minutes to establish a connection, which may happen in the middle of a download.D-link suggests that you downgrade the speed to10Mb which will reduce files transfer speed in your network by a tenfold. But the issue is not resolve. Upgrading to new firmware (2.50)won't resolve the issue either. Furthermore, replacing the network card for a new one won't resolve the issue.If you want to spend many hours fussing, calling & e-mailing tech support and rebooting a router and reconfiguring it until you are red in the face....go for it...
1	Caveat usage: Like the previous reviewer, I am finding lots of incompabilities between vendors. My D-L 624 works just peachy with the built-in in my wife's Dell, and likes my Proxim Orinoco. It hates my son's Linksys when any form of encryption is enabled, but with WEP off handles it fairly well. For work I coupled the D-Link 624 with the 650 card and it works just fine. I had my son buy a Linksys card because the router that he's sharing at school is a Linksys, but which refused to recognize the Proxim card that works with my D-Link. I think all of this indicates just how imature this technology is. It probably ain't you if it doesn't work.Also, DLink does a pretty good job of updating their firmware, and you probably want to take the time to update the BIOS (easy, just follow the fairly clear instructions) before you start loading MACs and enabling things (you can't import your old settings after you flash the bios - you start over from the beginning).
1	Delivers as promised: Not only does this product deliver all that is advertised but the service from D-Link is without a doubt the best in the high tech industry. Every vendor should take notice.
0	can't handle browser idle time (poor support): Installation was easy and everything looked great. Until I tried to access the internet via my browser the next morning ("page cannot be displayed"). All ideas of the helpdesk how to fix it didn't change anything (we exchanged about 20 emails) so that they agreed it was a hardware problem. I returned it and got the next one with the same problem. The answer of the helpdesk this time: don't use ZoneAlarm. And if this is not the problem, then it must be Windows XP. Unfortunately, shutting down ZoneAlarm didn't fix the problem. So the problem must be Windows XP in their opinion. That's an easy excuse because nobody can prove anything and I got stuck with my router and my problem. So I returned it.Conclusion: if you have a dial-up connection and don't stay connected while being idle, this is a good product. If you have a cable modem and don't shut down your computer all the time, try a different router.
0	Awesomely horrible product: Wow. What can I say other than this has got to be one of the worst electronic purchases that I've ever made. The DWL-G650 is a pretty good PCCard, however the DI-624 router is absolutely horrid! From the moment I plugged it in it wouldn't quit rebooting itself every1-2 minutes kicking me off the network. Firmware flashes didn't solve the problem at all nor did a replacement product. (Incidentally, Amazon.com was WONDERFUL about sending a replacement product). How D-Link gets away with selling this product is beyond me. I'd read similar reviews on the product with it constantly rebooting however I must admit that I'd written those off as the typical "home user" that really didn't know what they were doing. Well, as a network engineer and systems administrator at one of the world's largest computer companies, I have to throw my towel in to the absolutely worst network product I've ever worked with here in the DI-624. Please... avoid this router at ALL costs.
1	Not as good as season one, but...: Season one South Park was hilarious, an absolute riot - But unfortunately it lost its way a little in season two. However, season two is still really funny and these DVDs are well worth buying. If you have a high (and I do mean high!) tolerance level of all things foul, then you HAVE TO buy South Park: Bigger, Longer, Uncut - UNBELIEVABLY FUNNY, YOU WILL NEVER SEE ANYTHING MORE FUNNIER!
0	Not so funny: Just got through watching this. The jokes are cruder, less funny, and they just keep on beating on the same thing again and again. I enjoyed the first 3 volumes but these don't cut it. Also, you can't fast forward thru the credits or FBI warnings (that appear with each cartoon. I was disappointed in this release.
0	Awful!: This is one exploitation that has no story; or the story is so hard to follow that it is incomprehensible. Rita Calderone is gorgeous, but other than that - this movie is thumbs down.
0	In a word: Terrible.: How anyone could rate this debacle above one star is beyond me. First of all, this is not the Grateful Dead that you hear playing all your favorite songs. This is a sad and withered remnant of the once great band. I love the Grateful Dead so I decided to buy this box set hoping that, although the shows are from the early 90s, that the band could still rock. Unfortunatly, I was wrong. Their playing is awful. Its sparse and sprinkled with lame synth garbage with whatever keys player they dredged up this time, it really doesn't matter who. They play such classics (hint: sarcasm) as Wang Dang Doodle, Touch of Grey (which was, incredibly, their only chart topper even though its an awful song), My Brother Esau, and sundry other lame songs. Do yourself a favor, if you love this band, don't buy this box set, its like watching a dying lion. You know how powerful it was in its heydey, but all you can see now is a sick, mottled mess. Stick with their audio stuff.
1	Recommended: The conclusion and final disintegration of the formerly powerful patriarchal family. Brings one through the third generation of tradegy, loss, and spiritual transformation and leaves almost every individual in misery. I enjoyed the first and final books in this trilogy and feel I came away with a better understanding of the conflicting forces at work in Egypt as well as the impact of culture and morality on individual actions and spirituality.
1	Awesome!: Omg These are so dang cute! I can't wait to try them out! I used the top part as a 'cookie' mold but I'm gonna use the entire thing next time. :)
1	Could be compared with Living Colour: These guys remind me of a softer Living Colour (Vernon Reid, etc.) Not bad for mid nineties. The music hasn't aged much at all. Highly recommended.
0	terrible, even at a low price: I bought these clippers for cutting hair at home. Even when fully charged they offer very little power and tend to bog down when clipping only mildly thick hair. The charge doesn't last through one haircut.The trimmer blades come off when you try to advance them with the thumb slider to adjust the length of hair being cut, and they don't trim evenly. I finally gave up on the trimmer attachment and went with just the trimmer blade over a comb.I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone. I was extremely disappointed in it.
0	Piece of junk - do not bother.: I've been very disappointed with this since we got it. Even with the unit fully charged & operating with the cord plugged in, it struggles to keep up with normal hair cutting. It takes multiple passes to cut, what would have taken our last trimmer, a Norelco plug in model that lasted 8 years, one pass.Build quality: poor. Everything in the kit feels cheap.Too bad we held onto this past the 30 day return policy. Do not buy this trimmer.
1	Excellent for the money: I have used a Wahl hairclipper for many years, but wanted one that was more portable and had guidecombs that would allow me to cut my hair a little longer. The Wahl model 9627 is compact and flexible. The guidecombs allow me to cut my hair up to1 and 3/4 inches long. The unit can be used with or without a cord and the smaller size makes it easier to maneuver than larger ones. It does an excellent job of cutting hair. It does not appear to be as durable as my other Wahl clipper, but that is an acceptable tradeoff. It worked flawlessly out of the box and has a two yr warranty. The money I am saving on haircuts makes that a bargain.
1	If you want to improve your health, read this book: I highly recommend all of Norman Walker's books. Although written many years ago, I think they are even more relevant in today's world. It is an easy to read book with information that will have you wanting more even information about the subject. Also, please read all his other books.
1	Great!: I thought this movie was awesome. I've always thought Dana Carvey was a hilarious actor and this movie was just as funny as he. I recommend it!
0	A waste of talent: This movie was probably the biggest bomb of1994. It's a real shame too as it has some talent in it's ranks like James Earl Jones, Dana Carvey, and Kevin Pollak. However, this was very unfunny. Mind you my heart really wasn't into this movie anyway as I had a rejection the night before I saw this, so I couldn't focus into the movie, but there really wasn't anything to focus into here. It's about a guy who has amnesia whenever he goes to sleep, and he ends up witnessing a murder.....what's so funny about that? I honestly feel that this is one of the worst if not "THE" worst movie ever made. This was even worse than "Ishtar" folks. I don't have any desire to see this again, and I won't own it either. Like I said this was the biggest bomb of1994.
1	The beauty is in the truth: People,wake up!The truth may hurt sometimes,but,it gives a picture.Lee has given me what I needed,an insiders view,albeit a bit of a kick to Beckett at times,but,I was never there,was I?I see music,or hear music,and,Tim Buckley is me seeing,hearing,and knowing my home.Lee has given me an answer to why my home is thus,and thank the lord I am not alone.I read Blue melody 3 hours straight,and finished it off this morning,I ate it,rather than read it,and,Lorca and Starsailor demand my attention,these seem to me to be the main message in the book,don't talk,just listen..As much as David Browne may seem sincere in his writing of "Dream brother",there is no substitute for knowing the man,Tim Buckley,than for reading Blue Melody,by a friend who was there.Starsailor,you will never dim.Lee,shine on.
1	My Pup Can't Get Enough of Them: My Rottweiler is allergic to almost every animal protein on the planet. So far, he is doing ok with whitefish and salmon. That is why this treat is so good. It does smell strongly of fish, it smells good. Its got a crunchy texture, its unlike any other pup treat I've found. My pup loves it, when I take the bag out of the pantry he runs to the kitchen and sits for his treat. Don't even have to call him.The 28oz resealable bag is great, the treats last a long time. If your pup has allergies, you may want to think about giving this one a chance. Guaranteed, your pup will love them.
1	A realistic view of what it is like to have dementia: This was a book that was kind of hard to read at times because it was written by an individual who actually had Alzheimer's. However if you really want to see how the individual themselves are affected by the disease this is a good book to try to read.
0	Only for those in absolute need of resolution: I never thought I would say this about a book in this series, but I hate this book. I was absolutely disappointed with the way Card chose to resolve his story. I'll give him license since he may do what he will with his story, but I feel so bitter about this ending to such a magnificent saga that I can't recommend this to anybody that isn't dying of curiousity at the end of "Xenocide".And to those who believe you fit in this category, I'm sorry for the feelings you will like possess upon completion. I honestly feel the same unrest now as I did when I finished "Xenocide". I hope everyday that Card will come to his senses and revise his plot here to be more logical, less rushed, more conclusive (which some may argue with), and more fulfilling to a character of such quality as Ender Wiggin.
0	Should never have been written: I highly recommend NOT reading this book, which managed to diminish the magic of Ender's Game for me. Stop at Xenocide, which was pretty good, and skip straight to Ender's Shadow, which is VERY good. This book is exceedingly disjointed, makes way too much of the Valentine/Peter dichotomy, and is boring, boring, boring. Where I couldn't put the other Ender books down, I had to really struggle to finish this one. And then wished I hadn't.
0	Weak ending to a great series: I was disappointed with this fourth (and presumably final) installment of the Ender saga. Indeed, this story isn't really about Ender at all but about the 2 Ender "clones", Peter and Valentine. While this does not make this a bad novel, frankly, I was hoping that Card would have found a way to make the demise of Andrew Wiggen, one of the more interesting protagonists in science fiction, more memorable. Wiggen's death is reduced to almost a footnote in this installment and I could never generate the same degree of interest in either Peter or the young Valentine
0	A poor ending to a great story: I can't tell you how dissapointed I was in this book. It was not what I have come to expect from Orson Scott Card. Many authors take a concept to the point where they just fill pages with words (i.e. Piers Anthony & his Xanth tales), but I expected more from this author. I know Card is capable of better work Treason, and the entire Alvin Maker series are a testament to that, but this last book in the Ender Wiggins saga is not in the same class as his other works. My best advice is to ignore this book and enjoy the Ender Wiggins Trilogy
0	How could this happen?: I dunno--I liked the other three books in the series. For some reason, though, this one just seemed tedious. Character interaction is there, sure, but it seems dull and plodding. Everything about it just seems to lack the spark that usually makes Card so great. I suppose if you've read the rest of the series you'll probably want to read this one too, but don't expect too much. Card's biggest (only?) letdown.
0	Card should have quit while he was ahead !: He misses the mark on almost all counts. The charecterization sucks and the plot *feels* manufactured. The growth of Ender Wiggin from a child to the speaker for the dead has been dealt with beautifuly in his earlier books but the entwining of ALL threads into this story is frankly unacceptable.In fact I even see traces of Alvin in Children of ..
1	GREAT ENDING TO THE BEST SCI-FI SAGA EVER WRITTEN: "Jane closed her eyes, smiled, and then all four of them were gone. Only the mothertree remained in the center of the clearing, bathed in light, heavy with fruit, festooned with blossoms, a perpetual celebrant to the ancient mystery of life" I write this last paragraph of "Children of the Mind" from memory as I felt it was worth it to memorize the ending to the greatest SCI-FI saga ever written. This book ending the "Ender's Saga" is a masterpiece of writing. The characters are rich and full of life both good and bad. The morale battles waged are gripping and thought provoking. I recommend without any reservations that anyone who loves to read a well written story that they buy all the books in the series and pass them on to friends, family and loved ones as you will be giving them a gift of more than just words on a page but a gift of what life is all about.
1	A new triumph of a great mind: This book, the forth in the Ender series shows whyOrson Scott Card is one of the best writers of ourtime.Every novel in the serie has been as different fromthe ones before it as books in a serie can be.In this novel Card brings to conclusion the storyof Ender Wiggins in a way that is both surprisingand highly imaginative.This is a book that no Card fan, and in fact noscience fiction fan, can afford to miss.
0	Too many miracles....: Children of the Mind read similarly to the stories I wrote in 2nd grade. Though more sophisticated, it had the same rambling tone, as if the author didn't quite know where to take it, and wrote the story while searching for a way out. In doing so, the story became too unbelievable, to be enjoyable. There were too many miracles, too many near deaths, too many almost destructions. Every time Card couldn't think of a way to get himself out of a tight situation, a new "miracle of science" was discovered, making the story a winding tale. The question is raised: Is it fair to give a lightsaber to a man facing lions?The ending left you hanging, but I, for one, have no desire to learn or read more. I have a feeling this was not meant as the end of a series, but the beginning of a new saga. A saga that may draw in others, but will continue to destroy the perfection of the original, Ender's Game
0	Things kind of got crazy...: ...and the thread of the story seems to just run further away from the original concepts. Wasn't thrilled with the new ideas expressed in it and wouldn't recommend it as a good read.
1	Very scary and very good!: Once I started this book I couldn't put it down! The only thing I didn't understand was the ending. Otherwise this was a great book!
0	I didn't get "it": I like Adam Sandler, but I didn't like or "get" this movie's point at all. Forewarning: This is not Sandler's typical role. I'm all for him branching out into different styles and I think he's quite capable, except I had a very hard time getting past that because of all the weirdness in this film.The opening sequence is just bizarre and you wonder throughout the entire film what the point of the instrument is. The relationship between Sandler and his love interest is equally bizarre. This has DEFINITELY an indie type of film feel, but does not come close to ONE HOUR PHOTO, which I think also has the same type of feel, yet is far superior. This movie is disturbing at times and confusing at others. I felt like I was doing drugs during this movie (which I can assure you I was not). The ending is a "Huh?"
0	Move on: I saw this movie when it was originally released and have to say that may thoughts of it have not gotten any better in that time. I had high hopes for it going in and kept waiting for that moment when I would feel that my money had not been wasted. The moment never came. This was an awful movie. Boring dialog, uninteresting characters, painfully slow pacing. This is really no different than any of the other movies Paul Thomas Anderson has written and directed. This is the worst of the big 3 but they are all highly overrated.
0	Worst Movie I've Ever Seen: I've seens some bad movies in my day, but this one takes the cake. There is no subtle charm in this movie whatsoever. There are several scenes that have nothing but silence - no background mood music, nothing. Then, many of the other scenes have painful background music that drags on and on. Further, the cinematography is horrible. There are random camera shakes which I thought are part of the plot line when in fact it is just poor production. Not surprisingly, Adam Sandler cannot hold his own in a non-comedic role. His acting skills left a lot to be desired. As I walked out of the movie after about 40 minutes, I noticed that the door in the back of the theater was left open. I soon realized why as more people began walking out after I did. Make your own decision here, but I strongly recommend seeing anything else, or go golfing or something. Don't waste your time.
0	Don't Bother: How anyone could think this movie was anything but complete garbage was beyond me.I guess a lot of these reviewers are extremely "deep."
0	Not Worth Watching -spoilers-: This movie is a bore! And kind of annoying!It's not a romance/comedy! Drama...er...a little? Not a lot.Alright, the story itself is good. Plot is terrific, characters alright. Acting is great.The constant music through-out the movie was just annoying. The camera angles and shadow shots were just irritating. The only character that wasn't a complete Mary-Sue (or one-dimensional) was the main character, Barry.This could have been a great movie if it wasn't for the script, the shooting style, and the annoying background music.
0	Save your time and your money...: I saw this movie after seeing trailers for it on a couple of occasions. I thought it looked like a light comedy/romance. What a waste of my time and money! The only thing that kept me from leaving the theater was the hope that it HAD to get better eventually. Wrong. I'm not a big Adam Sandler fan, but that wasn't it at all. I actually thought he was pretty good in this, but I thought the movie itself was disgusting and depressing. One review I saw said it was a "dark comedy"....well I agree that it was definitely dark! Not much of a comedy, though. Thank goodness we all have differing tastes, because some people may see something redeeming in this movie, but I truly thought it was one of the worst movies I have ever seen!! Again, save your time and your money!
0	Sad, sad, movie: I love quirky and insightful movies. I watch THE USUAL SUSPECTS, SPANISH PRISONER, GLEN GARY GLENROSS, and all the rest and enjoy them over and over, relishing in the twists and turns and messages that these movies dispense. But, I'm not going to slap kudos on PUNCH DRUNK LOVE. This move is as disturbing as it is sad. The violence is not enjoyable. It was nothing like the trailers portrayed it to be and I will not recommend it to anyone.
0	punch drunk love: This has to be the worst movie I have ever seen. Adam sandler is the ony reason i kept watching. No plot, No real story to the characters. SAVE YOUR MONEY!
1	The Craziest Most Beautiful Movie In A Long Time: A great example of a film that was able to combine a weird dramatic tension with a crazy emotional tension: laughter/crying at the same time. Crazy dialogue and situations that logically shouldn't work, but do in the most amazing way. The best American film since David Lynch's Mulholland Dr.
1	ANOTHER GREAT NOVELLA BY THE AWESOME DIVAS: I truly enjoyed this work of fiction by my favorite authors. I hate to tell what is in a book, but when you see these four authors and including Felicia Mason, pick up the book and run to the counter. Each story centralized around age, divorce, widow, lost love and true love. Each story was awesome and you wouldn't be upset at all that you decided to purchase it. Pick up this book and let the adventure begin. Read the other reviews and they will tell you a little more. I love to read and watch a good movie and I get highly upset when I am told about it before I got a chance to read or watch it.
0	Flexrake100A: I have had a hula hoe for year. It has worked will and the handle is worn out. After receiving this aluminum handled Hula Hoe it broke after two weeks. It is because of the way the aluminum handle is inserted into the hoe head. They make cuts along the end of the handle and insert it into the taped end of the head. This makes it very weak. I bent after a little use. I contacted Hula Hoe and they are sending me a new handle. However, until they swedge the end ot fhte handle to fit the head instead of cutting it the handle will only break again unless it it reinforced with a wood plug, which is what I plan on doing. Intill the design is changed I would recommend only the wood handled model.
1	Four Stars - For this price you know what to expect!: I'm not going to get into many technical details. Not because I can't but because at this price range you KNOW what you are getting. With that said this unit has performed very well. Most of us will never run this at the high end of the volume spectrum, so distortion isn't an issue. The average person will be more than satisfied with this unit. One thing I will mention is that the "Auto Calibration" (for speaker set-up) using the included mic was not close enough for me. Most people probably wouldn't notice. There is a Robust menu for customizing your sound with many features found in higher end receivers. The remote is a little cheesy, as most are lately. I'm using it in a smaller home theater in my bedroom. Main/only home theater use would be fine, plenty of power and way better than the receivers that are in most "canned" systems (all in one's). Good receiver/great price (approx. two hundred dollar range).
0	My third POS Sony...: The left rear surround died after 2 years soon followed by both front speakers. Complicated setup, heat sensitive. Give it a pass. This is my third and last Sony product I will ever buy. I've got a '70s era Pioneer in the shop that runs forever, I think I'll give them a shot this time.
0	Worst receiver I have ever bought: Mine lasted all of 2 years and now it has stopped working. Up until now, I have never had a receiver last less than 7 years, so I am a little peeved. I ordinarily have good luck with Sony products, so I am fairly disappointed that this receiver died so soon. And FYI, I keep all of my electronics on surge protectors...
1	This book is well written: This book is well written. I love the details of the history of Seven Oaks. It does include some pictures which help to illustrate of a time and place long lost.
0	BEWARE! Pan and scan DVD: These two movies are not Conway's best, but they are still pretty good. The only problem, and the reason for the1 star rating, is that the DVD presents these films with the sides cut off. In other words, Pan and scan. Had I know that, I would not have bought this.
1	Great Movie: In received my video very fast. I love doing business with Amazon. I never had any problems with them. The movie is great if you like Tim Conway. I love the old movies. They are classic to me. So you should enjoy the movie if you enjoy him.

0	Not so good: Bad, It really couldn't catch my attention. So so acting and not so good effects. The plot has been overdone.
0	"But what are her chances?!": This movie is great to watch if you're having a bad movie night with snarky friends. As a serious movie, it's a joke. The acting is atrocious, the effects are beyond cheap, and the plot *rolls eyes*. But like I said, it's good for a laugh especially on a bad movie night.
1	Another Supreme Vampire title!: this one is good very good in fact! imagine vampires came forward and revealed themselves to the world (only about 4500 world wide) sun does not harm them they are allergic to silver (umm werewolves eh sheesh) and beheading is fatal its a modern future that looks decayed such as ww3 took place (in london no less lol) but the explanation of vampires as an evolutionary step rather then supernatural was refreshing for a change yes they can climb walls yes they drink blood and yes they are super strong ( as demonstrated in the video of vampires showing themselves lifting something not so light hehe)4 of 5 stars only one star loss for being a little talkie but theres enough action and vampire action to make this film a must own to any true vampire fan!
0	a million thumbs down: I only gave this movie one star because there wasn't an option for NEGATIVE 5 stars, but since I did give it one star that star goes to the pseudo 'special effects' (split screen, going backwards, speeding up) which is the only plus about the move. The rest of it tanked, big time. The plot was numb, the characters numb, the acting from some seemingly talented young hot stars was numb. Overall, this movie made my brain go numb. The voice overs were nauseating! Yeah all those things happen to teens in college, but they went a little overboard.It was really bad and I didn't realize it was a Sundance movie, otherwise I would have been a little more prepared.The only treat was looking at the cute gay guy named Paul. Shannon Sossamon was the only stand out 'performance' if there had to be one.DO NOT BUY OR RENT THIS MOVIE...!
0	When the movie ended the fun began: Seriously, the best part of this movie is when the credits roll. That's when Erasure's "STOP!" kicks in, a raucous song that will have you up and on your toes.I tuned in and out of this movie when it was on HBO, it never really held my attention. Sure there were some cute actors and actresses who were stripping down now and then but the whole movie was just bizarre. I kept watching though because I was bored. Finally this piece of junk ended and my favorite band started singing.Instead of buying this, just go buy any one of Erasure's great albums instead. More bang for your buck.
0	Awful: Spend your money for some other DVD. If you're interested in watching this movie, just rent it.
0	where are the rules?: Simplicity of it... the first of 45 minutes of it was intriguing, then it just falls apart.
1	Quite Possibly ...: This has to be the best, or one of the best pieces of cinematography that I have ever seen. The spit shot scene, the numerous shots of time fast-forwarding and rewinding, the multiple character thought patterns, all help to add this to my favorites list. I am very impressed with the well thought out characters, extraordinary dialogue, and character motivation. If you haven't seen this movie I recommend that you do it's an excellent piece of movie magic.
1	Excellent book: The book is composed of different events that happened in the author's life. It is the life of an Armenian immigrant family in the beautiful San Juaquin Valley. Although, the story is about events that are happening in a particular Armenian family, in reality it is the life all immigrants in America. The stories some how effects all Americans. I am positive that some where in our lifetime we were criticized for a certain cultural trait. It is the story of the ultimate underdog who is determined to succeed. At the same time it is a very fun and easy book to read. I could not put the book down.Saroyan has to be the best writer to come out of the West. He should have been recognized more for his genius work.
0	Really Sad!: I remember the first time I heard Nelly, it was back in1999/2000. I am sad to see great musicians fold under the weight of the music industry. She sold-out big time and will never be the same. The album title is very appropriate as she is nothing more than American sex appeal and MTV. I miss the music...
0	GWEN'S LEFT OVERS: I bought this album cuz it was on sale for $7 bucks. It ONLY has 3 good tracks: Maneater, Promisuos,& No Hay Igual. The rest of the album is boring and unexciting. This album sounds like Gwen Stefani's left over from LOVE, ANGLE, MUSIC, BABY.
0	a Corperate Broke attempt at Gwen Stefani: sine Nelly Furtado's last album basically went Reynolds Wrap here in the states the Record Company was like we gotta get you some grooves,lets get Timberland. Timberland during the mid to late 90's hit his peak as a Beat-Maker,but never really added anything to himself beyond beats&he eventually fell out of Groove. Nelly Furtado is now forced to play catch up with Gwen Stefani in a attempt at a Accessible sound&style that while has a minute or two coolness,loses it's appeal rather sooner than later. vocally she is a lightweight. her best attempts at coming back are on places where Timberland can't be found.this is only her 3rd release&the record company already is pushing her to being a Gwen Stefani Clone. the irony is that Nelly is more comfortable in this style than what I heard on Gwen's Solo Album,but on the real neither album made much of a impression on me on a whole.
0	A little catchy, pretty disappointing: It's more grown up than her previous albums in bad way. I can't play a few of the songs with my kids around. While the inappropriate songs may be catchy, it's disappointing that they had to be so "give it to me". It's also missing the "rap/yodeling/soul" stuff that made me like her so much in the first album.
0	What a sell out!: I loved Nelly Furtado's cd Folklore. But what I used to love about Nelly Furtado was that she prided herself in her music... not bumping and grinding with Justin Timberlake. Why does nearly every single famous female feel the need to suddenly become a sex image? She's a gorgeous girl and she doesn't need to sport a baby tee to prove it. For that reason alone, I can't see myself purchasing her cd despite her talent in music.
1	whatchutalkinbout?: people are saying nelly sold out and changed but why? She was always a little bit of r&b and hip hop anyways beneath all those folk tunes. She was in a hip hop group before her first album, cited mary j blige as one of her favourite artists(queen of hip hop soul), duetted with missy and did turn out the lights which sounded hip hop. Stop messing around with nelly just cause you don't have the talent she does for songwriting and being able to switch genres and looking damn beautiful all the time! What's also great about this Cd is that she's having mass appeal reaching out to blacks, whites, europeans, asians etc. and people off all ages from mothers to teenagers to college kids. and this isn't something every single artist out there is able to do. My hat goes off to this chick for kicking booty this summer!
1	Plain and simple: YOU NEED THIS CD!!I have been waiting a long long time for another N. Furtado album and it was honestly worth the wait. Granted it's completely different from her previous work (which are also great) but its ok for artist to change, evolve, and simply play around with other forms of music. Honestly, I perfer to listen to artist who are willin to take chances and try different things because I know I'll be entertained. This cd is crack from beginning to end.CAUTION: May be addicting.
1	Cold War Fun: I hadn't seen this movie since I was a kid and when my Dad recommended getting this I was glad you did because it is so funny. The humour is still fresh despite the cold war being over. A movie like this could never work today but its still good clean fun.
1	movie: I wanted a copy of this movie because my husband is in it.I haven't watched it to the end yet, so I hope he is in the credits.Came quickly,good condition.
1	Classic movie!: Been looking for this movie on DVD for years. One of the all time classic comedies. Comedic timing perfect! Not your "action packed" comedy, but nonetheless a star-studded classic. Put on par with the original "Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World."
1	The Russians Are Coming, The Russians Are Coming: A very entertaining film made during the cold war. There are numerous humorous scenes that typifies a New Englander, from the town drunk who envisioned himself as reinacting Paul Revere's famous ride to the old Veteran who thought he should organize a militia to protect the city from what was viewed as an impending attack by Russians who only wanted to find a way to get themselves back to sea. I think it is well done. Alan Arkin does a great job portraying a Russian officer who is frustrated with his Captain.
0	the movie is great, but the two on dvd i received are NOT coded for the USA!!!: this is suppose to be a multi-national, coded dvd, but 2 for 2 were rejected by my new dvd player. i then placed both into my lap-top and a message displayed that 2/5 codes worked while 3 were inactive (USA, being1/3 inactive codes). so, don't purchase this dvd unless you watch it on your computer online. HOWEEVER, the movie is excellent!!! it is totally clean, comical, with some drama, romance, and warmth of humanity. so i have cept one of the 'not coded for the USA' copies for my laptop, because i cannot get it anyother way apparently. NOT EVEN FROM AMAZON!
0	Mail Order Ties...: I can't recommend ordering ties on line--or at least, from this vendor. Tie was not Navy--it was ROYAL blue. Plus, the stitching started falling apart after 2 uses.
0	Mixed feelings: So I feel weird about this book. I am down with Montessori "schooling", but this book didn't give me anything new, in fact most of it was pretty dated. And much of the theory was very common sense, such as how to show your child how to do something, I was like "um...yeah, no kidding". Also, I don't know if this is because it is so dated(40's?) but many of the tasks for "3 to 5" year olds my11/2 year old can do, or is already learning, I felt like much of the things this book guides you to show your two year old, my bobbler already gets. There is even a part where it suggests we start teaching colors at age 3, my kid knows all his colors even though he can't say them. I am not bragging here, it was just weird. Also the "busy board" is put together with upholstery tacks, and I am pretty sure I wouldn't want my kid playing with something that included tacks.There was NOTHING here that I couldn't find on Montessori sites, or mom blogs.
1	Excellent addition to your collection: I collect action figures and when I saw these I immediately thought they were the most original action figure I've seen in a long time. They are fun to assemble they have a good number of variants coming out and they are completely interchangeable. In fact the website even encourages you to make your own parts and to paint them. They are capable of providing hours of fun for anyone from 8 to 60+.
0	disapointed 8 year old: My son bought the green and tan stikfas. First he was disapointed that there was only one figure. He'd imagined a number to set up a battle. At this price that is unlikely. (Maybe this is a creative toy for grown ups in there early 20's with lots of money.) He built it, searched the web site, did an experimental bit of decorating and left it on the dining room table for a week. They are currently living in a zip lock bag.
0	Very Disappointed!: I was looking forward to getting this book. Well, I just got it in the mail and am extremely disappointed with the information. Many of the towns I am very familiar with because I have either visited or done research on my own. The bottom line with this book is this: the information is not just old it is "very old"! Save your money, buy a different book, or just do internet searches. I wish I had.
0	Buy the green stuff instead -_-: It doesn't seem to matter how much I press the edge in to the surface, I just canNOT get a clean paint edge with this tape. It was only super important to have a perfect line on one wall (accent color), and I can't even get that one wall out of this tape. I've done touch up about 4 times, and it's not even a big wall!The only reason I didn't give1 star is that this is the "delicate surfaces" tape, and it DID come off more readily than the regular blue tape. I'm working over fairly old molding in places, and the regular tape left gunk, and took up the finish - this kind did NOT damage the molding at all.
0	Doesn't work as well as original: I recently put in bamboo flooring on my stairs and needed to paint the sides of the stairs where they were scuffed during installation. I used this "Delicate tape", which didn't do anything like a painters tape should. It didn't stay put and was constantly curling up at the corners, the paint seeped through onto the new stairs. Lastly it actually removed a lot of stain (stained black by manufacturer) from the floor boards.Don't bother with the fancy tape names. Stick with the original. I can only assume that Scotch found a way to skimp on the glue and called it "delicate".As a side note, I bought two of the other "New Styles" of tape, one which was supposed to keep lines crisp and straight. It did neither. It was worse than the Frog Tape, which doesn't live up to its name either.I hope this review is helpful for others. There is nothing I hate more than touch up work when painting, and this tape, and the whole new line from my experience, creates a lot of touch up.
1	Running Blind ( Jack Reachger no 4): I always enjoy the Jack reacher series. They are easy read and always keep you gussing. Jack always comes out on top. Too bad he can't settle down with a good woman.
1	uncanny: like the way he fiqures out the truth, lots of action. always getting himself in danergous situations. Great character, well written
1	Gripping: I am now on my fourth (in a row) Jack Reacher novels by Lee Child who manages to combine hard action, originality and excellent storyline twists which keep you guessing right to the last page. Thoroughly recommended.
1	Good book: It was a very good book! I cant wait for the next book in the series. Reacher at his best.
0	Not the best Reacher: An interesting idea for a crime spree, but this is one padded story with a fairly predictable "twist", especially as Reacher books go. And there are some scenes that make almost ZERO sense. If you're a Reacher addict, you'll read it anyway. If you're not, save your time and money.
0	Horrible: I hated this. Read the first Reacher book a couple of weeks ago, absolutely loved it and got completely hooked. Just finished Reacher #5 and about to download 6.If you ask me, the first two are stunning (5* masterpieces), #3 is good but not as good (different feel to it but still interesting, 3-4*), but this was horrible. The CIA came across as completely unbelievable, the 'twist' was visible a mile off, and the whole thing was based on a flawed premise (SPOILER: hypnosis just doesn't work like that).Five was better but also flawed (3*?).The first two were so good that I am going to plod on, however. Hope the series gets back on track.[this reminds me of the John Rain books, where the first two are stunning and then the whole thing gets tired fast once he leaves Japan and gets his annoying sidekicks...]
0	This IS 'Running Blind': This is the same book as 'Running Blind'. If you own that title,(good book, by the way), don't waste your money on this.
1	Running Blind (Jack Reacher No. 4): I thought the ending was a bit "flat" compared to the first three Jack Reacher books. Also, I thought the degree to which the FBI tried to set Reacher up stretched believability and necessity. However, all in all I have enjoyed the Jack Reacher books and will purchase future titles.
1	Good who and "how" dunnit. Keeps you guessing.: Great dialogue and keeps you guessing until the end. Although it is an earlier Jack Reacher novel, it shows that high tech and CGI are not necessary to make a good exciting story.
1	good read: Just past the middle of it. Not as much violence as the other books but it has more curves in the plot than JLO... If you dislike the FBI, than you will love how Jack screws around with them.
0	dvd does not play: I was very excited to get this movie on dvd which did arrive very promptly. Unfortunately, this disk from Movie Mars will not play on my dvd player. When I press play, the message CANNOT PLAY is displayed. I have ordered many dvds from Amazon and have never had this problem.
0	3 Defective Phones from ATT and Counting: I ordered this phone form Cingular (ATT) and today my third defective phone came in the mail. A customer service rep told me that 85% of all her returns and exchanges come from this model phone. The first phone had a handset speaker that didn't work and the next 2 were, in the words of the customer service rep, "DOA" -- dead on arrival. It would be a really nice phone if it worked though...
0	How can a phone not have an ear bud jack??: The phone itself is pretty good, feels comfy in the hand and the bottons protrude and "click" so it gives nice tactile feedback, something missing from almost every phone on the markey. So you know what you're pressing at all times, almost no texting errors.However, two flaws, and one of them is MAJOR.1. How can a phone not have an input for an earbud? This is absolutely unacceptable, and I've never seen a phone in the last 6-7 years not have a simple ear bud jack, ridiculous! This is the sole reason I returned mine, as I do not care for Bluetooth, I prefer simple corded earbuds as they are cheap to replace if lost.2. Another pretty serious flaw is the battery. It is rated at 3 hours, but that is pushing it.Overall this could have been a great phone, but two pretty stupid, unthinkable mistakes like not including a basic earbud jack ruins it.
1	Functional and Fairly Durable: I received this hamper as a baby shower gift and then turned around and purchased one to give to a friend for her baby shower. It's quite attractive and available in several nice colors. Since it doesn't scream "baby," it maintains its usefulness over the years, and folds up into a nice slender package when not in use. The durability of the inner mesh lining is my only issue. I've had to repair the cloth loops a couple of times when I tried to haul heavy loads - but the repairs were simple (I'm no seamstress, so it was REALLY simple) and the hamper is still functional after three years of use.
1	Java Programming with Oracle SQLJ - above average: My knowledge of Oracle and Java is beginner/intermediate level and I like this book a lot.The book explains how SQLJ relates to SQL, PL/SQL, Java, JDBC and it provides a good introduction to the JDeveloper IDE (Integrated Development Environment).The book is written very clearly and the appearance and organization of the text is well up to the O'Reilly standard.I can't comment on the worked examples yet as I have not yet tried them out.
0	Awful Fake Compilation BEWARE!: The music is not by the original artist. Like buying bad Karioke. Very misleading.
1	A history of a major Wall Street bank and more.: When in1976 Jerome Kohlberg, Henry Kravis, and George Roberts left Bear Stears to form KKR, Wall Street realized these three dealermakers might become a major force in the restructuring of American big business then beginning. What could not be predicted was the heights KKR would achieve. It has risen from the ranks of upstarts to become a major player in "The New Establishment." While KKR has been the subject of other books and articles, none could be considered "definitive," as is "The New Financial Capitalists." It is more than a history of a bank, however. Baker and Smith have addressed the problem posed by the separation of ownership and management delineated in1934 by Adolph Berle and Gardner Means in "The Modern Corporation and Private Property," indicating how the leveraged buyout programs of the1980s helped resolve it.
0	Does not fit!: Nicely constructed but does not fit my 2002 Oldsmobile Silhouette. The description "For GM 87-05" is too vague.
0	Wouldn't Recomend to Anyone: Bought it for my 2003 Pontiac Sunfire. Hooked all the necessary wires up, disassembled the dash and popped out the radio, only to find that the harness DID NOT EVEN CLOSELY RESEMBLE the factory harness. If one is looking for sheer disappointment, have at it. Buy it in bulk then. Heck, go ahead and tell your kid Santa isn't real while your at it. Whatever tickles the ole pickle.
1	I never ordered this but get to review it anyway!: Gotta love the internet, I never purchased this item but love to review things. How is that any different than professional sports I will never know. Semper fi, never been in the military either......
1	Metra Harness: I LOVE Metra products!!!!!!!!!!!!They make installing a stereo SUPER easy,allows you to solder all the connections easily in your workshop or kitchen or wherever your good lady permits you to work,then you can makesure you have a sturdy and safe set of connections,remember the vehicle is either the family transport,or the way you get to work,go out in with friends,so why risk a car fire and a pile of plastic crap on the floor where your carpet once was.Spend the extra $$$$ its really worthwhile................if you need to speak with Metra they are very helpful
0	Well....not quite what I anticipated: This bag was going to be for me to use at college, and quite frankly it was WAY too small for that. It is more made for elementry to middle school kids. So luckily I have a little sister to give it to, but otherwise, I'm pretty disappointed.
0	why do people like this so much?: It is really low quality and the straps are uncomfortable.I bought it for my daughter If I had seen it before I would not buy it. I think it is not good for a child. Because comfort is more important for them than adults.I will not return it but will not use for school.I am very disappointed.It is like a joke!!!
1	Simple, good backpack: This backpack is everything a backpack should be; simple, functional, and well-fitting. I would undoubtedly buy it again, although it seems as though it will be holding up for a long time to come.
0	This looks nothing like it does in the picture . Very misleading: I got excited when i came across this bag because of the colour and when i received it i was very disappionted the colour is nothing like the one in the picture and i am so not happy with this bag .
1	hannah montana clock: my daughter loves this clock. She's 7 and wanted to start waking up by herself. It works!
1	jansport backpack: It's a great book bag. Very roomy, and sturdy. The pattern is pretty: young teens adore it!! Price is fair for this item.
1	JanSport backpack a hit: Great backpack! My son goes through them like you would not believe. This time, I think he'll have no choice but to make this one last!
1	Perfect!: I've used Jansport backpacks for years and the quality is great. I wanted to find a rare color so I purchased it in Light Purple Passion and love it! The color was slightly different as I thought the strap/padding part of it was black but it turned out to be a dark violet & the strings to the zipper were striped not solid. Even though it wasn't the same as shown (not really a good thing) I ended up liking it better than the sample picture.
1	High School Backpack: I especially love the color of this backpack, it is very cute, however since this backpack only has two pockets it does not have a lot of space for textbooks. Other than the space issue it is a very nice backpack.
1	receive faster than i expected: The product is nice and I got it faster than I expected. Very nice purchase experience!
0	Bag is here as it is but the fabric is cut from the top.: I received my bag and it looks exactly like i wanted it. Problem is it's cut like someone has used a knife or razor to cut it a whole 5cm cut on the top of the bag. This is not what i really imagined to get.
1	It's fresh!: My bag has remained fresh since its still wrapped in plastic, but everyone should know what to expect from Jansport bags: durability, comfort and versatility.
0	light duty backpack: Purchased it for junier high school student. it's not big enough and also you can not image how large it actually will be. Overall, it's low cost and low quality bag and you can buy it at local sports authority cheaper and easy to return or change it if you don't like it after receiving. Will not buy those bag anyway.
1	Great Backpack!: Great Backpack! Love the color! The only thing, is that it gets dirty easily. I got a pen mark on the pocket, and I'm not sure how to remove it :(
1	"Kim...hits the spot": I remember years ago, riding on a bus, listening to the radio. "Kim the Waitress" came on and I was blown away by what an excellent song this was. The feel of the song, as well as the instruments used during it were absolutely intriguing. The fact that such simple lyrics can be transformed into such a revolutionary ballad is inspiring! So anyhow, years went by and I became content with the fact that I would never pin down the artist of this wonderful song. But...I did. And I listened to the rest of this brilliant cd, and was blown away by it as as well. Go figure!
0	Not up to the standards of the first two LPs!: Freak City Soundtrack finds our Chicago lads getting a little too close to their Marshall stacks - The Jesus & Mary Chain would be jealous of the feedback that permeates this record.For those who thought International Pop Overthrow was a little too candy-coated, you'll definitely get your fill of crunchy guitars on this one.The late Jim Ellison does a great job of taking the pi** out of "guitar gods" with his one-note solo during "Help Me Land."Still, I'd try IPO or DU (if you can find them) before FCS. Why these MI CDs go out of print in under five years while record companies continue to churn out copies of fossils like "The Best Of Cat Stevens" is beyond me.
0	Static in My Ears is more like it: I'm all for giving local bands a chance and that's exactly what State of Being is, a local Cleveland band. And that's about as far as SOB is ever going to get by writing songs like this. If you enjoy thin sounding music created with Casio keyboards and lyrics that are reminiscent of sixth grade theatrics, then you'll more than likely enjoy the tracks on this disc. I had a problem just getting past the weak and monotone vocals.This disc did absolutely nothing for me. Other than make me wish that I were deaf.On a positive note, the lead singer is kinda cute.
0	Stuck in old Testament: I always liked Davids first books and was looking forward to reading the 2 end times books he wrote but his proof text is all old Testament and has NOTHING to do with America in fact the verses he used was spoken by the prophets for Israel only and not the Church. It has taken a real strong man to do what he has in the past sometimes just him and God but now that he older the same conviction of his teaching are making him unteachable and I fear just stuck in his own ideals. If you really want to know what going to happen to the world just stick to reading the book of Revelation. I threw his 2 books on the end times in the trash can so no one would be miss lead by them.
0	Sad, Sad.....: Mr. Wilkerson is, as far as I can tell, a decent and sincere Christian man. This book, however, is a strange trip into whacko-land!The Bottom Line: This book is full of "prophecies" that are obviously false. Time has been cruel to the Pastor's prognostications. Big thumbs down.
1	LOVE IT!!: Am very limited in what I can eat, and this product is a definite keeper. Is easily and very quickly prepared. Left-overs store very nicely, and this is yet another product I cannot find where I live, so am doubly grateful that Amazon carries this.
0	In a nutshell: This book was recommended reading during my studies on interior design, so I bought it without really looking into it. I was disappointed. Maybe I expected too much, maybe the title misled me, but it seemed very much based on thumbnail sketches and it wasn't what I was looking for. It is a thin little book full of rough pencil sketches that you could easily lose down the back of the sofa! (in a nutshell). I wanted to know the more indepth technical ways of doing perspectives and this book left me in the dark.
1	Plugged it in ... Next thing I know I am Connected.: Install the drivers, shut down, plug it in, boot back up and Windows knows right where the drivers are. Then suddenly it's installed and I am connected to my router. After being connected I went in and configures WEP to work and all those fancy things.I like this card and was surprised at how easily and quickly I was connected with a nice strong signal. My desktop is upstairs, but the wireless access point is downstairs. This card still gets a good signal.
0	Careful: Will Freeze Up Your Machine: My experience is like a lot of others - I bought this unit with high expectations for good performance but found that it would regularly freeze up my machine. When I removed the offending unit the freezes were gone as well. Additionally, the installation manual had erroneous information in it. Ask yourself what kind of company would put out an untested product like this and still forge ahead with a clear conscience, and that just about sums up D-Link. I would recommend LinkSys or any other vendor until D-Link improves the quality, dependability, and reliability of their products.
0	One of the worst films I&#65533;ve ever seen: When Snipes is playing in a film, I'll routinely pick it up, confident that it won't be bad and might be terrific --- he's done some great stuff. Sadly, this film is an unbroken string of cliche laden dialogue, actions and plot lines. I watched it for 25 minutes before going to Amazon's Reader's Reviews, which is what I usually do before taking out a film. If I had done so, it would have saved me some money and 25 minutes of my time. Mystery Science Theater 2000's Robot and Servo would have had a field day with this flick. It's bad enough to get their undivided attention.
0	Snipes can do better!: This movie is a rip-off of many other action movie...It felt like a little bit of Mission Impossible with a pinch of Enemy of the State thrown in. Wesley Snipes stars as a U.N. spy, a very typical character in these James Bond style movies of one man takes on dozens, and wins. The plot is as difficult to follow as it is thin. The film centers around the concept that the U.N. is trying to build itself up as a major world power by framing people for the assasinations of heads of state. The movie does not spend enough time to develop this plot and thus leaves the viewer distracted from the action. Throughout the movie, you are presented with a small list of people for the "who-done-it" style ending, which I'm sorry to say was very predictable. Overall, this film is worth watching on cable, but I personally would not pay the money to rent or buy it.
0	Absolutely Terrible: I love Wesley Snipes, I have enjoyed many of his movies, but this is one is really really bad. It is painful to watch this film, if you can even call it that. The only part of this movie I found cool was the credit sequence at the beginning and the opening shot. The rest of this movie is a pile of cliches, with no purpose. The action sequences are very mediocre, with nothing new being shown. The dialogue in this movie is where this movie gets hurt very badly. The plot is ok, but if the dialogue had been sharper this movie could of at least been watchable. The one-liners made me cringe. The conversations between the characters is the same old, same old. This movie is completely unwatchable, and I recommend you don't watch as it will destroy your respect for Wesley, which no one want to happpen.
0	WTF: I am very, very, very confused as to how this movie is getting an average of 3.5 stars.Now I can understand that some aspects of a cluttered film like this one can be appealing to some but I have no clue as to how somebody could derive enjoyment from the plot. The movie played like a broken record: nick cage would complain (in a voice over) about his fat balding body, his brother (also nick cage) would talk for awhile then main character nick cage would try an aspect of the story and end up masterbating.This must have happened five or six times in the film with parts about the wirting of the book that this crap movie is based on. I don't see how the production studio could get away with the plot they used. They portrey the actual writer of the book (a very real person) as a insecure, ugly, drug attic who tries to kill the brothers (It's a shame she coulden't didn't succeed sooner).In Conclution this movie was a piece of sh**. save yourself some money and skip this one.
0	Where to start?: This movie was so slow and long. Once you finally reach the last 45 minutes, you have reached the best part of the whole movie. Just let this movie run while you are busy doing something else.
0	More Hollywood Schlock: Yet another braindead, hollow, formulaic Hollywood concoction with the standard ingedients: load up on bankable stars, throw tons-o-money at it, pump up the "buzz" and voila!, another Hollywood blockbuster.I can't believe all the hype surrounding this movie. An inane script with absolutely nothing important to say about anything. And what's with all the buzz surrounding the Kaufman's? You'd think they were the Next Coming the way critics go on and on about their supposed brilliance. It amazes me to see how much praise is bestowed upon writers whose only strength is their cleverness. As if being clever constitutes great screenwriting. Does "Memento" ring a bell?
0	Quite possibly the worst movie I've ever seen: I have attempted to watch this movie twice. After getting part way through it both times, longer through the second time just to force ourselves to give it more of a chance, we shut it off due to the fact that we were so incredibly bored.I have absolutely no understanding of what any of you, who liked it, see in this movie. Perhaps it gets better, but when over half of the movie is dead, I don't see how it could.
0	Might be the only one but I hated it.: From reading the other reviews it seems that everyone else loved this film more than I did. I wanted to leave the cinema (two of my friends did) when I went to see it. I found the story between Meryl Streep and Chris Cooper well acted and touching but I was irritated by the parts of the film that featured Nicolas Cage's character, Charlie. For me it was almost as if he was getting in the way and I left the cinema with the distinct impression that I would have enjoyed it much more if I had simply read the book.
0	Over-rated, lame-arsed-pomo dreck...: Well, at least Kaufman seems to know that he can't write a third act to save his (or his fictional brother's) life. The emperor is officially desnudo, my friends.
0	don't be fooled, this movie is TERRIBLE!!!!!!!!!: like many unfortunate souls out there, i had heard how great adaptation was, blah blah blah. i rented it and proceeded to utterly waste two hours of my life. i'm writing this for one reason only: to try to stop you from doing the same. believe me, even bill and ted's is a better film. this movie is pathetic.
0	Worst Movie Ever: This movie was BY FAR the worst movie I have EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE, that is not an exaggeration. When I saw it, I went for free to the Sneak preview screening compliments of my local radio station, so I didn't actually waste any money on this atrocity (thank the gods). However, It was so utterly bad that I felt I had still been wronged for having wasted my TIME having gone. In addition, this movie has in fact ruined Nicholas Cage for me FOREVER, I cannot take him seriously anymore. The worst mistake he ever made was agreeing to make this movie. If I had a copy, I would not sell it, I would BURN IT!!!
0	watch something else: Nicolas Cage is brilliant in his interpretation(s) but I can't understand how this movie can get 5 stars... it is boring boring boring and quite ridiculous in some scenes.
0	This is horrible: I'm sorry, there is something very sick about this CD. These kids have absolutely no talent and sing about things like insects stealing your food. Whoever created this CD has made a mockery of "mentally challenged" kids everywhere. I tried as hard as I could not to laugh at this, but....I'm afraid it's impossible
1	Fast Music From Slow Kids: The next time Bono or Scott Weiland whine about how being a rock star is some sort of elitist job, I want to huck one of these kickass CDs into their heads and kill them. As for the band, all I can say is wow.
0	What a Joke: I have to say that I don't feel I need to say this music is good because these kids are retarded. I laugh every time i listen to this. I feel bad for the people with normal mentality who produce it and play the instruments for these kids. HILARIOUS. All the people who say its good are probably just a bunch of single white females with no lives who complain about everything and blame violence on t.v and video games.This CD sucks. But it gets me laughing
0	THE MUSIC KINDA BLOWZ: It just wasn't good i do better sometimes it was funny though so maybe it's worth buyin you know!
1	Peony: Bought this book to read for book club. It is very interesting and believable. The club enjoyed it as well.
1	Awesome Access Point with 802.11g speeds: This AP has some good quality features. Filtering, WEP, soon WPA, and more. I have this plugged into my 4 port router and now I can access the Internet with my laptop and DWL-G650 (wireless adapter for laptop). These two products give me great range (throughout the house, and even outside), good security, and a reliable wireless connection. This is all I need for a small price.
1	Fantastic!: Beautiful Music! Its like a magical evening with pitch perfect angels singing to you! I highly endorse this! 2 thumbs up!
0	DONT READ!!!!: This book is the downer of the century. Just when you think something is going to happen BAM!!!! the book is over. I accidently finished the book. Thats pathetic! Most fiction has a rising action that is not present in this book. Its a great book about nothing.
0	If I believed in burning books, this would be the only one I'd torch: This stands as the longest work of "literature" I have ever been forced to read. Not due to the page count, as it is actually rather (mercifully) short; it is merely the most monotonous and plodding work of fiction ever published, in any language. When I read the book, I had hoped for a punchline - at some point the story would actually take form and progress. Instead, I felt as though I had been accosted by one of those people who insist on showing you their boils and bunions while you are trying to eat your lunch. Its only merit is that it is a prime example of what aspiring writers should NEVER produce. If this book were distributed in Guantanamo, Amnesty International would object, and rightly so. This is the pinnacle of academic torture, and those who assign it should be investigated, very closely.
0	Awful Literature: I'd give this book0 stars if possible, it was a horrendous read, a truly awful book that is forced upon high schoolers everywhere.
0	Not Suggested for the Clinically Depressed: And if you're not currently among the ranks of the depressed, you will be after reading this novel. Seriously, I did not find the novel either a) beautiful or b) worth reading. Perhaps it would have been very moving in a tragic sense if I had bought any of Wharton's feeble attempts at painting a story of forbidden love gone wrong. The novel entirely lacked any real connection with human emotions and behaviors. Perhaps, if the storyline of the book were my life, it would depress me very much. The pointlessness and ironic misfortune of these characters lives is remarkable, but I was left feeling too apathetic to be upset by this fact. I do not suggest you torture yourself by reading this novel, unless you have a flair for masochism.
0	Wharton gets her point across: If I were to use four words to review this book, they would be: "thank goodness it's over". I did not enjoy this book at all. With her tale of loneliness and a tragic "lovers' pact" set in the cold and unforgiving New England snow, Edith Wharton attempts to draw us, the readers, into the black pit of despair known as her life. She succeeds marvelously. _Ethan Frome_ is a prime example of how literature can effectively evoke emotion. Wharton was an unhappy woman, and while reading her book, I was unhappy as well. Even though his story is tragic, one cannot sympathize with Frome; he has suffered for most of his life and will continue to suffer for the rest of his life, but his own choices took him there. I recommend staying very far away from this novella.
0	Ethan Frome: It's classics like this one that discourage me from reading classics! and if I have to come up with additional words: here they are!
0	AWFUL, BORING, DONT READ!: I decided to read this book after seeing it on a list of supposed classics and the positive reviews here on amazon. Boy do i regret it.I am now wondering what is the criteria for labeling a book "classic" because i can not appreciate ANYTHING from this book. Watching paint dry would be a better way to pass the time.I'm also starting not to trust the postive reviews on Amazon since this the second time i've been burned by you guys (Huxley's "Island" also sucked)
0	The WORST book in the history of ink!!!: ... Ethan Frome is a worm with no backbone who was afraid to stand up to his overbearing wife. Period!! The story is irrelevant to life in the 21st century. If you are unhappy in a marriage you'd get a divorce. ... This is one book that actually DISCOURAGES people from reading. After reading this piece of garbage you'll wish you were illiterate!!.
0	Times have changed: When Edith Wharton wrote "Ethan Frome," long, long passages of exposition were perfectly acceptable fiction. That's changed. No one who doesn't have to read this book will read it. A pity; they'll miss out on Wharton's lucid and luminous prose. But for today's reader, it's a dull, dry book.
0	How BORING!: This book was so detailed - i don't know how someone could drag out a 48 hour period of time into 9 chapters. Very detailed and drawn out. If you dont have to read it don't.
1	Wonderful reference!: It is really a shame this book is out of print! I have had my students read it for in-depth, inner knowledge of the Supreme Court. It is a book that holds the interest of the reader whike giving factual information about our highest court. Now I must find some sort of alternative, equally as intriguing. I truly wish the publisher would consider returning the book to print!
0	I tried hard but I failed: It may not be fair for me to rate this book as I was not able to finish it. I even thought of just deleting it from my book list - that's how I don't like it. Tried to read it at different times of the day but I can't help but fall asleep over it, every time! Much as I hate to leave a book unfinished, this isn't just worth my time and effort. I won't mind if people will think of me as shallow, but in my opinion, deep subjects such as the one tackled in this book can be presented in a more interesting and engaging manner. Doesn't matter if she's a Nobel Prize winner, if this is her style, I don't think we'll ever click.
1	Sweet and depraverd: Saint Reverend Jen, partron saint of the uncool, makes the Lower East Side, tenement to the world, seem like shangrila. She has a way of making the depraved seem sweet and the bizarre seem like common sense. This guide may not tell you what beds Washington slept in, but it may tell you what beds you can.
1	Should be a good read: Hi! I'm a teenager that was in a small group (called a "D"-group) in which Wendy was my leader. She's a very gifted writer and a strong Christian, and her books are fun to read and interesting. I would definitely recommend it.
1	They don't make great classic movies like this any more !!!: Trail Of Robin Hood is a great movie with Roy Rogers and my favorite actresses is Penny Edwards. I feel all these movies need to come out into theatres again so people can take a step back in time to remember and see the greatest actors & actresses in the world.
1	Groovy, funky, out of control good!!!!: I purchased this album after hearing "slide" on download.com. That song is so slick that I assumed the rest of the cd must be good. I was right!!! Kind of reminds me of Vikter Duplaix meets Van Hunt. Got some r&b grooves, some dance/funky house. Some uncategorizable tracks as well but it is all nicely done.
1	Nice Booster!: This is a wonderful backless booster seat. Much more plush than most you find for sale. Light weight, comfy, and nice fun color. My daughter loves it!
0	$3 Bucks Down the Drain - Just Awful: I started the movie and could not get past the cheesy presentation or the music. Fast forwarded 7 min and the cheesy presentation was still going with the cheesy music and some cheesy person trying to speak over it. No way I could get through any more of it and turned it off. I generally wait until the end of a movie to give it a fair assessment. In this case I did not need to wait till the end; two minutes was as long as I could stand. Save your money!!!! TOTALLY TRASH
0	Volleygal: If I could leave zero stars, I would. I picked this up thinking it was de Palmas Dahlia- what a complete waste of time... I forwarded through most of it..not sure why...I guess I was hoping I hadn't wasted my money. Please don't encourage this guy to make any more movies...seriously, it was awful.
0	TERRIBLE, UNWATCHABLE GORE FEST: I also was unaware of the fact that there were 2 "versions" of the movie. I have to ditto other reviews. Horrified, my husband and I fast forwarded assuming this was some sort of dream sequence gone bad and the investigation would start up soon. Wrong. Just avoid this movie it is really awful.
0	Everybody Dies: John Cusack and Ray Liotta, amongst others, get lost in a motel in the middle of nowhere. It`s a rainy, obscure night, and suddently people start getting murdered for no apparent reason. As each character dies, the closer we are to descovering who the murderer is...This James Mangold`s thriller ("Girl, Interrupted", "Kate and Leopold") has a few nice twists and surprises, but the character development isn`t strong enough to make us care much and the multiple changes on the last part only make it worse. It has a suspenseful atmosphere, competent acting and neat direction, though the final result doesn`t step above average. A decent, schizophrenic thriller, but nothing great or terribly exciting. Watchable.
0	Ghostly Court: In reminiscence to Hitchcock's classic, a film tells of ten strangers staked and murdered at a motel, but presents an emphasis on mental conditions meeting something supernatural.I think combining weird with earthy is not a too clever attempt itself, adding a kind of round table court proceedings surely.What is realistic it is a completely inappropriate court order which reflects movie-makers own civic expertise probably.
1	wow - a film that's scary and smart at the same time: I wouldn't suggest seeing this movie more than once...unless you're looking for clues that give away the ending. However, I found that although this movie might've started out as a typical horror film, ...it dosn't end that way.
0	Lame Hitchcock Ripoff Wannabe: Even John Cusack can't save this. I expected to see something different. DO NOT BE FOOLED. This has been done before though some people believe it hasn't. This was a rip off of many Hitchcock stories as well as some horror films.PEOPLE GETTING BUMPED OFF AT RANDOM: Original...not!KILLER WITH MULTIPLE PERSONALITIES: Been there, seen that!A BUNCH OF PEOPLE STRANDED TOGETHER: What did they use a generic script?Maybe, just maybe I'd give an A for effort if this hadn't been so boring. This is definitely one of the most disappointing films I've seen. Nothing was original. The director and writers tried to imitate Hitchcock's brilliance and failed miserably. Word to the wise: DON'T MESS WITH THE MASTER.Skip this or you'll regret it. The only thing good about this film was Rebecca DeMornay. Even she couldn't rescue it.
1	PSA: Skip other guy's review below-it gives away the ending!: Public service announcement: If you haven't seen this movie yet, do not read the review below entitled "Seems interesting, IT'S NOT WHAT YOU THINK" as the mental midget who wrote it exposes the twist and gives away the ending. What a moron!By the way, the film isn't bad, but not great. Not as mind-bending as Memento or Usual Suspects, but better than many so-called thrillers floating around out there. As mentioned above though, the film does fail Psychology101.
0	Identity crisis: John Cusack is always great, Rebecca DeMornay's few minutes onscreen are well done, and Ray Liotta delivers as expected, but I'm really surprised they all agreed to work on this film. What a disappointment. Anytime you find yourself laughing when yet another character is murdered in some tired old horror movie fashion, it's time to hit the stop button. Even when you realize that everyone with a room key is going to die, it isn't suspenseful or even an issue because you don't really like them anyway, and they certainly don't care much about each other. The "plot twist" at the end is a total cop out and fairly predictable. (Wasn't it 20 years ago that Bobby dreamed an entire season of Dallas?) Maybe I would have enjoyed it more if I'd watched the alternative ending(s), but the final version was more than enough for me.
0	UMM.... WHAT CAN I SAY?: First off, was she her own editor? Because there were a lot of mistakes in this book, the more I read the madder I got. Most of the time the book didn't make sense. I paid way too much for this book and it was only100 some pages, and it didn't have any kind of meaning. I take that back the meaning of this book showed me that she was DUMB & STUPID AS HELL. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY. Buy Fly on the Wall by Trista Russell it's better and cheaper.
1	Buzz words and phrases: Back in the 70s this group became legend among musicians of every genre at the time. We found hundreds of ways to filter lines from these recordings into every day situations and never got tired of listening to this hilarious spoof that took every one of us back to the days of southern local radio shows that our parents listened to religiously in the 50s. Like all satire, it's not that much of a stretch from the reality of what those shows were really like. This is one of those moments in time that just can't and won't be duplicated ever again. A diamond in the rough, indeed.
1	Good ole' boys playin' for 'em good ole' boys: In the words of ole' Roadhog himself this record is "mighty fine". I heard these guys live when they opened for the Stafford Brothers and Mother Mayball Carter last Winter down to the Johnny Mack Brown Highschool gym and was imeadiately impressed. All I can say is buy as many copies of this country classic as you can get yer hands on before it goes out of print.Five stars jist aint enough, Thanks boys and keep on a'singin'
1	British Science Fiction At Its Best!: Watch a fine cast of English actors keep up stylish upper lips as they confront a mass impregnation by fierce aliens. It's the original film adaptation of the book "The Midwich Cuckoos."
1	I FEEL HER PAIN!: When I first heard this song I was startled! This song sounds like it really came from deep inside her heart. We've all been hurt my men in ourlives..and yes we all feel like SCREAMING "I HATE YOU SO MUCH RIGHT NOW! AHHHHHHHHHHHHHH! ..I SYMPATHIZE. Every time I hear her song I BLAST IT!..So I can hear her scream to her full extent. She is awsome! I recommend this to all women who have been deceived and lied to by men. Womens National Anthem!
0	Let's Tear Down This Wahl: HiI bought this shaver based on customer reviews,,So much for trusting anonymous reviews.. First of all it's cheaply made.....Motor is loud and slow compared to good shavers...had to glue charger together with super glue... one head on personal trimmer was broke.......poor quality shave even with the closest head it's not close.....takes15 hours of charging for a few minutes of shaving....If this truly is the last American made shaver it's a sad commentary on what we are turning out......Try a Braun Free Control for a foil Shaver or a Norelco for rotory and forget this junk.....well the first shave wasn't too bad and it's all down hill from there.
1	Great Selection: I have to say that I like Rhino and Varese Sarabande's CDs so much more that the slapped-together compilations that I find in the "cheap racks" at Tower (and other stores). This CD has a ton of great '80s hits on it...and the liner notes are really fact-filled, too. Get this and the Rhino New Wave CDs...you'll be set for your '80s fix!
1	We love it: I use it to decorate my sons's bedroom. There's not much dr Seus decorations stuffs on the market. But I did it with this and other stuffs and looks awesome. Ans my son loves his room.
1	Spice Girls In America Was An Awesome Documentary!: The Spice Girls new video is Girl Power packed, funny and entertaining all at the same time. It's like Spice World, but not scripted! This movie rocks!
0	never gonna come: well i ordered this and everything went good.well until they called me and said they were out of stock for at least 4-6 weeks.and in the status it said shipped but i guess it wasnt.and they still havent put out of stock on the page.so im trying to help u out of a month and a half wait.DONT BUY THIS!!!
1	AMAZING AIRSOFT GUN: I love this gun. I'm a new guy for airsoft and this gun help me so good.When I was fighting with my airsoft gun I bit evrybody in 4 seconds it's an AMAZING GUN.It's a good product.I think evrybody can buy this gu if you have money and I think a lotof people wish to have it.YOU CAN BUY IT.
0	Can only be used with full zoom: The E550 is a good camera and this lens does do a good job of zooming in on the subject but due to the way the camera and lens are designed, you must have the camera's zoom fully extended in order to use this tele lens. So this means if the subject is moving around a lot, such as my daughter playing soccer, you will miss the shots where the action has moved to close to you because you can't zoom out. As long as the action remains at some distance to you than this zoom lens is useful. I unfortunately have too many ruined shots because the action moved too close and their heads get cut off, etc.Another negative is that the viewfinder doesn't show the zoomed in image, you must use the lcd screen to frame a shot, which can be difficult in bright sunlight.
1	Pretty good: I liked this book. Precise, easy-to-follow, and a page turner. I'm interested by graphic design, and is Illustrator10 is one of vector programs. This book is recommended if you plan to know anything about the new version.
1	The Machanic: An excellant film shows Charles Bronson at his best the steely eyed hero out as usual to wow the watching public and as usual chooses a script to suit I think his rugged personality.Truly an actor pulling you through every twist and turn. I can thoroughly recommend this DVD as it is exciting all the way and you never know what the character is thinking before the next something else happens. A film though to watch I think on one of those rainy days with your popcorn, may be a bit slow in places but you need to get right into it to appreciate it. If you like the hitman type of film then this is it but it is not difficult sometimes to feel sorry for the victim.
0	Big Disappointment: Nice gimmick, but lousy story. The director is in love with the way he's telling this mediocre story and that sustains the movie for the first thirty minutes, but then tedium sets in. I'm glad he tried so hard to do something different, and that may make the movie worth seeing (ok, it's worth seeing briefly for being unique, but you'll get bored with it pretty quickly so have another movie handy to put in when this one starts putting you to sleep). There is mild fun in trying to piece all the elements together, but once you do there isn't anything interesting going on. People are giving this movie too much credit for telling its story from both the beginning and the end at the same time with an actual ending somewhere in the middle, and aren't giving it enough criticism for being just a simple minded and uninteresting story to begin with.
1	you people...hahahahahaha: you know, i always thought that people who review the flicks on a website were just people who are small inside, and wish to be big and important...and influence the daily lives of others like yourselves. but lately i have noticed that movies that are so good sometimes need to be reviewed about. wether it's an awesome flick or a piece of shizzah, you just want to talk about it. and yeah, it makes you feel like you're doing something...writing on the internet! being an influence on peoples movie tastes! woooo(...)! so exciting! THis movie was pretty good, and now i consider myself...one of you! NOT!
0	Overhyped & Overrated: I seem to be one of few in my opinion of this movie which is that it's not a good movie. I felt the movie was boring and lacking of a good plot. I bought the movie believing it was a really good movie based on what I had heard but was really disapointed once I watched the movie. This movie in my opinion is very overrated.
0	Clean Slate II: Remember the Dana Carvey comedy "Clean Slate"? if not you probably won't mind that Momento is the non-comedy version of this Dana Carvey dud. The plot is fine, the acting is fine, the backwards story isn't as good as the backward episode of Seinfeld, but still fun. Basically this movie got some good hype early on, and has been too ARTSY for anyone to disagree. Not a waste of money, but not nearly as fresh or clever or new as it would like to be. A solid movie borrowing heavily from other sources. If one is not familiar with these other works, I am sure Momento is compelling, on the other hand, anyone who watches TV or film regularly will be dissapointed.
0	A Wildly Overrated Film!!: I cannot believe how many people loved this film. It is grossly overrated. Discussions around this film center on its "groundbreaking" backwards structure. Well, there is a little known film from the early1980's called "Betrayal" starring Jeremy Irons and Ben Kingsley. It is a film about a love triangle that is told backwards. TV's Seinfeld did a riff on Betrayal with the Indian Wedding episode. So this film is hardly groundbreaking. As for the story, I found it boring. Yet another revenge story, HO HUM. This film is just yet another variation on the Pulp Fiction influence.
1	nuF eivom: I've read that some people find the way the intro stuff is presented -- i.e. the way you get the movie to play in your player -- to be confusing, irritating, bothersome, etc. I don't get it. It's easy, just click on "Work" and it goes, there are other things you can do leading to other screens and more, which I think makes it a far more interesting "play me screen" than the standard stuff. The packaging has all kinds of tib-bits, as if it were designed by the same people who did the Beck's "The Information" CD. The movie is done well, and adds a twist to both the "backward-drawkcab" and amnesia themes, and it's an interesting murder mystery with a great twist at the end. More of a psychological movie with a little action now and then. It's not exactly breaking new ground, so I give it four out of five stars. But it is, as my title indicates, a Fun movie.
1	Engrossing and Thought Provoking To Say The Least: Wow, what a movie...I've had a few in the past that made me go directly to the internet to see what other people thought about the ending and specific plot elements. This movie, right from the start, sucks you in and does not let you go until the ending credits roll by. I was mad at first, some movies you really want to understand and this one lets a lot of the ending come from each person that watches it. You can formulate your own stance on the ending from the various events presented in the plot. A must see, and a great DVD!
0	Thanks robe4, for the spoilers...: This movie wasn't very good, and not nearly as good as I thought it would be. Read the above guy's review and you wan't have to waste your money on this pseudo-intellectual pig. If you want something to wrap your mind around, get Waking Life by Richard Linklater.
1	wow: what a movie if u dont loke this great movie theres somthing wrong with u its just pure genius loved this movie its on my top three next to the lord od the rings trilogy
1	A great movie.: This movie is excellent. It combines an interesting idea that is enhanced by the cinematographic execution of the narrative. It is a murder mystery with a twist. The movie is played in reverse chronological order with the occasional flash-back (which is a flash-forward in the movie time line) that gives you the perpsective of the hero (Leonard). He suffered a brain injury during a crime and remembers everything before the crime, but after it has no long term memory. He can only recall things that happened within minute or so. This means he has to make notes to give himeself cues and clues as to his current history as he tries to discover who murdered his wife.This is a movie you are going to want watch more than once.
1	Unforgettable.: Great exercise for those who like to think about the films they watch. Thanks to director Christopher Nolan whose original screenplay makes the audience feels just like Pearce's character, who knows what is going to happen, but not what happened in the moment before.
1	You'll watch it over and over: Heck, you'll have to. This movie makes you twist your mind and think around corners. After the first viewing I was wondering if the 'mystery' was ever solved! I see this as one of those great 'little' movies that are simply wonderful, like "Slingblade."
1	SMART MOVIE!!!: Brilliantly made movie. Guy Pearce is outstanding. I've never seen a movie made the way this one was. It was a little hard to follow. You have to pay attention through the whole movie. If you miss one part, you may as well start from the beginning. It is well worth the staight attention you have to pay. This is one of those movies where every time you watch it, you discover something you didn't see before. This movie has such a great story to it. I absolutely love the way it was filmed and put together. Kind of a suspensful, who-done-it, sort of movie. Rent it when you have time to get the most out of it and no distractions.
1	Interesting book: This is an interesting book. I like the three different voices she uses to narrate the three different worlds, and the way the most advanced world, being the most self-aware, is done in first person.Interesting questions are raised and about truth, right/wrong, etc. I do not agree with everything the author seems to believe, but this book would be a good springboard for discussion of questions like, "What is truth?" and "What/who is God?" and "Is there anything beyond what we can see and study with traditional science?"There are a lot of other interesting questions that can be pondered that the book raises but does not answer. For instance, was Alana's father exploiting her young heart and propensity to fall in love in order to save the world of Andrecia and, if so, is that a morally defensible thing?Not the absolute best book I have ever read, but worth reading, and probably worth reading more than once.
